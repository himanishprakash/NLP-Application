0,"FOUR, first boundary for batsman and team. Full and on the pads, needed to be put away and batsman did just that, picked it up and dispatched it over mid-wicket, couple of bounces and into the fence"
1,"FOUR, back-to-back boundaries to end the first over. Again, bowler is a tad short in his length, batsman had the width to cut and he didn't try to hit it hard, just placed it behind point and Bhuvi at third man gave up the chase pretty quickly"
2,"FOUR, hit straight back at bowler and he was late to get his hand up. Once more the off-cutter which almost fooled Jadhav, who shimmied down and checked his drive, middled it alright to beat the mid-off fielder"
3,"FOUR, another full toss, it's Jadhav this time and he picks his spot into the deep mid-wicket fence. Not great bowling from bowler. He's missing the yorker by quite a bit"
4,"FOUR, four more. Jadhav starting to really find his timing now and he's looking dangerous. This is smart batting rather than just throwing his bat at everything. He knows that fine leg is up and so he waits for the back of a length delivery to come to him before pulling it over the fielder. bowler under pressure"
5,"out batsman Run Out!! 1 run completed. Cutting has conjured a wicket out of nowhere. That's a sensational throw from the deep. My goodness. He's absolutely nailed the stump from long leg and Jadhav is out of here. This is a huge moment in the context of the match, especially as Jadhav was looking so good. Even this shot which he played was extraordinary. It was a length ball outside off, Jadhav sat on his back knee and scooped it over short fine leg. He was a little slow to decide on the second run, maybe a little hesitant and boy did Cutting make him pay! More than a couple of feet short, even with a dive. batsman run out (Cutting) 31(16) [4s-4 6s-1]"
6,"FOUR, goes down and smashes the full toss over the deep mid-wicket ropes. Some nerves maybe from the Afghanistan leggie and batsman pounced all over them with a mighty slog-sweep"
7,"out Caught by Yuvraj!! Rashid strikes back! That might have been the googly. Yeah, it seems so. batsman went for another slog-sweep, but due to the variation, Rashid managed to generate some extra-bounce which took more of a thick top-edge and lobbed up towards long-on. It still came really close to clearing the boundary though. Yuvraj keeps his cool and takes it smartly. batsman c Yuvraj b bowler 30(22) [4s-3]"
8,"out Caught by Henriques!! Straight up off a leading edge, taken! team taking control. There's no turn on the ball as Bipul fires it on leg-stump from round the wicket, Baby swings across the line and is undone by the sliding delivery. Good catch from Henriques too. He pedalled backwards from mid-wicket and made it much easier than it should have been. batsman c Henriques b bowler 1(3)"
9,"SIX, Rashid finishes with a long hop. To be fair, it's not abysmally short, but batsman is so good on the back foot. Rocks back quickly and hammers the pull over long-on"
10,"SIX, slower ball again but this time batsman hacks it over deep mid-wicket. It was slightly closer to off-stump and was given a fair tonk"
11,"FOUR, plants his foot down and absolutely drills the ball wide of a diving extra-cover. Overpitched from bowler, batsman blasts him away"
12,"1 run, dropped! Naman Ojha, with the gloves on, puts one down. The ball went high up and was swirling awkwardly all the way through. But at this level, it should be taken. batsman was completely duped by the slower leg-cutter. Such good bowling from Bhuvi to keep it wide of off and out of reach"
13,out Caught by Yuvraj!! Gone this time. Yuvraj makes no mistake at backward point. What a top over this has been from bowler. It may now be a mountain too high for the team to climb. batsman backs away to slash a back of a length delivery over point. But this is a leg-cutter which bounces spongily and he slices it up to the fielder. batsman c Yuvraj b bowler 11(10) [6s-1]
14,"out Caught by Henriques!! That's the end of batsman, and of team. The little bit of reverse-swing which bowler uses to curl the ball away from batsman does his undoing. Despite it being another full toss, batsman slices it straight up off the outside half of his bat. Simple catch at extra-cover. batsman c Henriques b bowler 22(17) [4s-1 6s-1]"
15,"out Bowled!! Terrific yorker from bowler; a perfect way to seal wicket no. 100 in the IPL for the veteran pacer. The ball tails back in, zips through batsman before his bat could come down and plants leg-stump into its grave. bowler on a hat-trick. batsman b bowler 0(2)"
16,"SIX, full and wide, Mills has a proper dash at it and he's flayed it away over the point boundary. Magnificent hit. bowler won't enjoy that"
17,"out Caught by Warner!! Good lord, that's got air miles on it. Way up into the night sky, Warner settles under it at long-on and takes it. bowler had slowed the pace down on the delivery, causing Mills to go through with the hoick too early. Right off the toe-end of the bat. batsman c Warner b bowler 6(3) [6s-1]"
18,"SIX, first ball Choudhary faces in the IPL, he smashes it over long leg. A short ball from bowler, Choudhary swings into an instinctive pull and gets enough on it"
19,"out Chahal Run Out!! Direct-hit and that's it! team with a comprehensive win in the IPL 10 opener. Another pull shot from Choudhary, this one's straight to mid-wicket. Chahal comes running down only to be sent back and he had given up. Jordan with the bull's eye. Chahal run out (Jordan) 3(7)"
20,"FOUR, bowler goes back to the shorter length, batsman seems a tad comfortable with that, hops on one leg and uses bowler's pace to guide it past the diving short fine leg fielder"
21,"FOUR, might have been the slower one and batsman picked the bones out of that one. He cleared his front leg to give him more options and then slots the loft over mid-on, one bounce and over the rope"
22,"SIX, that ball hung in the night sky for eternity. Never looked like coming down. For what it's worth batsman gets the maximum result. Length delivery right in the swinging zone and batsman did not hold back, went full-monty and heaved it over deep mid-wicket. Six number one for batsman in IPL 10"
23,"SIX, batsman is in the mood. Mind you, he's not been in the best of forms, but IPL is his cup of tea. bowler dishes a full length delivery and hopes to get away with it, batsman doesn't allow him to, carves it over long-on for his second maximum"
24,"FOUR, batsman is playing the perfect foil to Gayle. Warner already worried. Full on middle and leg, whipped through mid-wicket and mid-on. Hit uppishly but placed it expertly in the gap"
25,"FOUR, not convincing, but batsman will take that. A very good over from bowler. Just misses the length this ball, goes full and that allows batsman to get underneath and hoick it over mid-wicket. Not off the middle but enough to clear the fielder"
26,"FOUR, Rashid throws it up once more and this time batsman threads the crowded off-side field. Overpitched and batsman went full-throttle on the drive, raced to the sweeper fence"
27,"out Bowled!! He strikes! The customary celebration follows. One hand up and the finger pointing skywards. The most delighted man in the dugout was his fellow countryman - Mohammad Nabi. He too had his finger up in celebration. The quicker wrong 'un and batsman clearly did not pick it, went back for the cut and gets cramped for room, only manages a chop onto the stumps. batsman b bowler 24(16) [4s-5]"
28,"SIX, a gift from Hooda and batsman thumps it over the rope. A full toss outside off, batsman takes a step out and slots it straight back over the bowler's head. Went miles back into the crowd"
29,"out Caught by Warner!! It was an experiment from Warner and it has paid off. Completes the catch, turns towards the crowd and does a fist pump. team have lost two in quick succession. Both set batsmen gone. Slows it up as batsman gives the charge, he goes through with the loft even though he isn't to pitch of the ball, miscues it towards long-off and Warner ain't dropping those. batsman c Warner b bowler 32(21) [4s-2 6s-3]"
30,"FOUR, lots of flighted and lands as a half volley, batsman gets a good stride forward and drives it past Henriques at extra cover, the timing was superb as long-off had no chance of cutting that off"
31,"FOUR, ordinary delivery from Rashid and Jadhav is all over it. The young man is shaking his head while taking his cap from the umpire. Half tracker which sat up nicely for Jadhav, who pulls it between deep mid-wicket and long-on"
32,"SIX, that looked like a half-hearted shot from Jadhav and it has travelled the distance. Picked the back of a length delivery and pulled it to the vacant deep mid-wicket region, just cleared the rope"
33,"FOUR, batsman does the most of the full length delivery, stays deep in the crease and opens himself up to free his arms, smashes it straight down the ground and even a quick Warner could not reach that from long-on"
34,"FOUR, lovely shot, sublime timing on that one from batsman, it wasn't anything more than a back-foot punch. This was a back of a length delivery outside off, he got on top of the bounce and placed it in the gap past point"
35,"FOUR, smashed, width on offer from Choudhary, batsman gets forward and thumps it over mid-off, couple of bounces and over the ropes"
36,"SIX, .. and batsman makes the most of the free-hit. Another pretty poor ball from Choudhary, short and just outside off, batsman rocks back and pulls it high and over mid-wicket, went sailing into the stands for the first six of IPL 10"
37,"out Caught by Mandeep!! The night has changed completely for the 27-year old team debutant. batsman has been dismissed for less than fifty for the first time against team - when he's playing for team. On a good length and well outside off, it was there to be smacked, batsman didn't go through with the shot completely, he was just looking to clear the infield. Mandeep times his jump to perfection at point and completes a good two-handed catch. batsman c Mandeep b bowler 14(8) [4s-2 6s-1]"
38,"FOUR, oh boy. He's toying around with the bowling out here. bowler looks to go wide outside off with the shortened length as well. But batsman in all his confidence walks across, crouches and half-pulls, half-sweeps it past the reach of the man at 45-degrees behind square"
39,"out Caught by Sachin Baby!! This was coming. It really was. Tactical aggression here from SD with his dance down the track looking to smoke some into the clouds. Does everything in getting right to the pitch of this fuller one as well, swings mighty too, just that he skews it off the toe end. All the altitude and into the safe palms of Baby at long-on. batsman c Sachin Baby b bowler 40(31) [4s-5]"
40,"FOUR, here's the pick up. Vintage batsman. Helped by an allying half volley on the pads at gentle pace and all he does with it is lovingly lofts his flick. All the timing and a bounce into the mid-wicket fence"
41,"FOUR, streaky. But the runs keeps leaking. Does it really matter how. Wide, half way down the track and batsman anticipates the ball to fizz up in flat batting it across. There's barely any climb, and all he gets is the inside edge to impart the direction in guiding it just past the sticks"
42,"SIX, whoa. This is getting back in the 2007 zone. Choudhary without a clue as to where to bowl goes full and wide. The mind-reader gets the front leg out and unleashes a full bat swing showing the maker's name in tonking it right on the extra cover ropes"
43,"FOUR, and it keeps getting better. Rocks back, stands tall, waits for the short drag down to sit up and swats in his swivel. All the crunch in the timing to reintroduce it back into the fence"
44,"1 run, oh Aravind. You really do not grant a life. Certainly not to this guy. Another compulsive pull here from batsman but with the ball gaining in height, only manages the top-edge. Right into the hands of fine leg, who slides and makes an absolute mess"
45,"FOUR, back to the usual. Is this a surprise anymore. This time the skipper decides to test him with a short one, one that neither has the pace nor the bounce. And obliged with a swat. As flat as you'd want"
46,"FOUR, on the charge. And the slap. The combo bags yet another fence hunter. Walks down, intercepts the length and gets on top of the bounce of this back of a length delivery in flaying it in front of square"
47,"SIX, into the first tier. And a standing admire from batsman. bowler serves a pie with the short sitter and heaved away. So very typical. Equally friendly bowling here as well"
48,"SIX, now batsman joins the act. Wants to ive his partner a run for his money. A run for some crowd catchers. Keeps banging it in short with the pitch sucking away all the momentum. Another mow across to give the crowd some work. Brings up his fifty. In some style"
49,"out Caught by Sachin Baby!! Some normalcy restored. And as always is the case, it is spin that gets on that duty. bowler doesn't mind giving it some air inviting the big swing. And gets just that. A full-blooded tonk down and skewed away. Almost teases Baby at the long-off fence with this one threatening to fly over, before the bucket hands facing upwards come to the rescue in plucking it out. They're checking the foot's behaviour - just inside the permissable limits. batsman c Sachin Baby b bowler 52(37) [4s-3 6s-2]"
50,"1 run, is that a bird? Is that a plane? Oh it is Mandeep Singh on his flying ways. batsman goes through with yet another ones of his delightful airy drives. Is in the process of admiration just as Mandy runs across at the long-off fence, leaps and pulls it back into the field of play. Almost plucked it out while landing down too. Oof"
51,"FOUR, head on. The battle continues. With Mills keen on cramping him up with the short pepper gets it barely up to the ribs. Just when he spots the bat going flat and the face pointing upwards in hooking it away. Behind square it flies"
52,"SIX, the march to the double ton gets another gear. And some help from Chahal in tipping it over the fence. Hooda opens up and uses his entire height to good effect in his tall pull. Mid-wicket takes another one in its kitty"
53,"FOUR, a salute in celebration. Takes the bat to his head in holding it up to his team mates inside. Covers all his sticks with a shuffle and after getting bored of the wides throws the kitchen sink at it and slaps it over point. #HisFastestIPLFifty"
54,"FOUR, full, down leg. Nothing right with that. Certainly not if fine leg is inside. Certainly not if that man is Chris Gayle. All batsman has to do is get the bat down in giving it some tickle. And places it wide and into the ropes"
55,"SIX, the murder continues. Mass murder. Another spirit buries itself inside this pitch. Overcompensates going short, going quick but the response is quicker. Is brutal too. Back to his high backlifted pulls. Gravity too cannot pull it down"
56,"out Bowled!! The zings light up. The crowd refuses to believe and keep searching for the ball. Nope, that's the end of the fun in store folks. Mills for a change aims for the stumps, going slower as well. Nicely off the back of the hand and foxes him with the seam position. A swat across the line is missed eventually and the top of leg takes the brunt. This has been some serious clock roll back here. Makes me feel 10 years younger. batsman b bowler 62(27) [4s-7 6s-3]"
57,"SIX, the yorkers too cannot stop the bleeding. batsman rocks way inside, crouches, gets underneath the supposed yorker and carries on from the finals a year ago in tonking the drive"
58,"FOUR, eventful first over from Choudhary, a wicket and 16 runs. Another freebie to end his over, short and wide outside off, batsman was all over it as he cracked it square past point, beats the inner ring and rolls away to the fence"
59,"SIX, a dramatic photo finish. bowler tries another short one but this time batsman ain't surprised. Stands up, uses his entire height to good effect and smokes it away. Admiring it as he does so. As flat as the bat motion could get"
60,"1 run, a direct hit at the bowler's end and batsman was struggling. He was coming back for the second run, Dhawan didn't respond one bit. Aravind was the man with the throw and he sent it to the keeper. Kedar Jadhav still had time to effect the run-out, but his shy is way off-target. batsman scrambles home with a dive. Coming to the ball, it was flat and wide of off, punched to the left of long-off"
61,"FOUR, too short from bowler, can't bowl those at his pace. batsman swivels across, rolls his wrists and pulls it behind square on the on-side for a boundary"
62,"FOUR, gentle loosener from bowler, short and on batsman's hips, he swivels across, uses the pace on the ball and helps it behind square on the on-side for a boundary"
63,"FOUR, lovely shot, batsman is getting into his groove now. Comes down the track, doesn't get close to the ball, that allows him to free his arms and drill it back past the umpire, no need to run for those"
64,"FOUR, juicy full-toss and batsman has put it away, turning out to be an expensive start from bowler. batsman leans into the shot and finds the gap wide of mid-off, no need to run for those"
65,"FOUR, make that four fours of the over, banged in short and on the stumps, batsman swivels across, rolls his wrists and pulls it behind square on the on-side. bowler was expensive in the final of IPL 2016, he has started badly here once again"
66,"SIX, massive, batsman shimmies down the track, makes room as he did so and goes high and over long-on, went a long way into the stands. Watches in admiration as the ball kept going and going"
67,"FOUR, thank you bowler says batsman as he clips a leg-side dross fine to claim his first boundary"
68,"FOUR, length ball outside off and batsman is away. Swats it across the line and gets it wide of mid-on"
69,"FOUR, shuffles across and flicks a ball from middle stump, easily done. With fine leg inside the ring that was always asking for trouble, batsman obliged"
70,"FOUR, bowler not getting the googly right. Again down leg and this time Rana gets a bit of bat/glove on that. The ball races away fine beating the short fine fielder"
71,"out Caught&Bowled!! Thank You! A typical Bhatia wicket. Foxes the batsman with a 116kph delivery and batsman is found checking his drive, spoons a straightforward chance and Bhatia accepts the dolly. Once again the Delhi man showing his variety and the key to his success has been the length. It was on a good length and batsman thought it was there for the drive. Not to be. batsman c and b bowler 10(12)"
72,"SIX, bowler would be proud of that shot. Banged in halfway down and the line was around off, Rana is quick to transfer his weight onto the back foot and nails the pull over deep square leg. Third six that bowler has conceded"
73,"out Caught by Dhoni!! First Tahir and now Bhatia. The slow bowlers are doing it for team. Bhatia lets out a roar as soon as MS completes the catch. He's been exceptional with his variations. This offie was bowled at 96kph, Pandya just didn't have the pace to slog it across the line, the top-edge skies up and Dhoni calls for it. Takes it in his own unique way, one leg up in the air. batsman c Dhoni b bowler 3(5)"
74,"FOUR, batsman welcomes him with a thumping drive. Bit of air and batsman plants his front foot forward, smashed it straight back over the bowler's head. Didn't bother to run, he knew he had middled it"
75,"FOUR, batsman goes downtown once more and gets the desired result. bowler goes fuller with the tossed up delivery and batsman drills it straight back at bowler, who is slow to get down and stop it"
76,"out Caught by R Bhatia!! Bhatia has made amends. Put a sitter down early in the innings, this time keeps his eyes on the ball and ends Rana's knock. It was the googly which was drifting away from the southpaw, Rana went down and slog swept it flat, Bhatia didn't have to move at deep mid-wicket to pouch that. batsman c R Bhatia b bowler 34(28) [4s-1 6s-2]"
77,"SIX, bowler shouted ""catch it"" and there was no way anyone could have caught that. The South African goes a tad fuller in his length and that enables batsman to get underneath it, slams it flat and over long-off for a maximum"
78,"no run, was that a drop? Need another look. Wide yorker outside off, batsman bends down to squeeze it out, the ball takes the under-edge and goes low to Dhoni's right. The former skipper goes with one hand and spills it. Tough one for Dhoni and bowler's unlucky day continues, second drop off his bowling"
79,"FOUR, unlucky and bowler have been synonyms today. Full and outside off, batsman throws everything he's got at that and the outside edge flies away fine and bowler just stands there in his teapot position"
80,"out Caught by Mayank Agarwal!! bowler gets the better of the West Indian. But credit has to go to Mayank Agarwal, he's pulled off a stunner. Length delivery and batsman miscued his loft, came more off the base of the bat. It was dropping in front of long-on before Mayank dived full length and grasped it inches from the ground. He didn't allow it to pop out even as he hit the ground. batsman c Mayank Agarwal b bowler 27(17) [4s-3 6s-1]"
81,"SIX, batsman nails this. He should have tried this shot on the previous ball. Once again gets his front leg out of the way to give him a free swing, bowler makes his job easier by bowling a length delivery, tonked straight back over bowler for a maximum"
82,"SIX, consecutive sixes for team. bowler missed his yorker by a few inches and is launched into the crowd. Low full toss outside off, Pandya keeps a firm base and carves it over point. Went a long way back into the stands"
83,"SIX, bowler attains normal services. Three sixes in a row. Pandya getting into the thick of things. Length delivery and Pandya dismisses it over long-off. Just stood there and dispatched it with disdain"
84,"SIX, make it four in a row. bowler and death overs are not the best of mates. He goes full and misses the yorker by a couple of inches, Pandya had enough to get under that and smack it over long-on"
85,"FOUR, four more. Already 22 off the over. A game-changing over this. Fifty up for bowler. Full and wide outside off, Pandya throws the kitchen sink at that and the outside edge flies wide of Dhoni"
86,"SIX, Smith has a worried look as Pandya sends another one crashing over the rope. Switched to back of a length and the result remained the same, Pandya went back and nailed it over wide long-on. Pinged the ad hoarding on the full"
87,"FOUR, sat up on a perfect length to be smashed, batsman rocks back and nails the pull over mid-wicket. Take four!"
88,"FOUR, this pitch is a belter, 180 is a must. Half-volley outside off, batsman stands tall and slams it straight of mid-off who dives in vain"
89,"wide, out Southee Run Out!! Where was Southee going? He might have thought that it was the last ball of the innings, but Pandya was sure that it was a wide and there would be an extra delivery. bowler fires it outside off, Pandya can't reach it and Southee was at the other end by the time Pandya could react. Dhoni lobbed it to bowler, who took care of the rest. The third umpire checks if the batsmen had crossed, Pandya got his back foot in before Southee could reach the crease. It's touch and go, but Pandya will cling on to the strike. Southee run out (Dhoni/bowler) 7(3) [6s-1]"
90,"1 run, dropped by Bhatia. A straightforward chance. batsman doesn't get control of the cut and he slices it straight to third man, Bhatia didn't even need to move an inch. It was going arrow straight towards his chest. Straight in and straight out. Oops!"
91,"SIX, for the first time this over, he pitches it up and batsman goes bam! Gets underneath it and launches it for a maximum over long-on"
92,"SIX, bowler turns back and smiles. That's all he could do. Ridiculous T20 batting on display. batsman shuffles and scoops a pacy length ball over the keeper's head, lands just over the advertising triangles. Back to back sixes for batsman"
93,"FOUR, floated full on leg-stump, batsman sits up and brooms it away with sheer disdain, rocketed away behind square"
94,"out Bowled!! Knocked him over. bowler is off with his marathon sprint. The crowd go bonkers. It was a slider, just skids on and slaps batsman's leg peg as he fails to connect with the slog sweep. Got too greedy and paid the price. batsman b bowler 19(14) [4s-4]"
95,"FOUR, gives himself a lot of room as he skates down the pitch, pierces the gap between extra cover and mid-off to perfection. Fast hands, full flow of the willow. Jos-outrageously-talented-batsman"
96,"SIX, that's gone flying into the stands. Greyhounds out of his crease, picks the bones out of it, a Tennis-esque flat-batted smite over wide long-off"
97,"out Bowled!! And again, Imran bowler is on fire. He's just unstoppable at the moment. A canny skidder this, just keeps going with the angle and clatters batsman's stumps. He may have got a bit of inside edge there. He wasn't fully forward, neither backward. Poor feet movement. batsman b bowler 3(7)"
98,"out Lbw!! Inside-edge onto pad, but doesn't matter, the umpire has his finger up. No turn, just goes flat and on the stumps, batsman is stuck inside the crease, tries to block off the front foot and ekes a big edge onto his pad. In real time though it appeared as if it had gone straight towards his pad. Wasn't to be. Big moment in the game? batsman lbw b bowler 38(19) [4s-3 6s-3]"
99,"1 run, direct hit and batsman was gone! Smith was the fielder, curses himself after he missed the target. A casual knock down the wicket from batsman, goes straight to mid-off, Smithy had ample time to target all three at the non-striker's end. A big miss"
100,"SIX, half-tracker and gone! Lovely swivel-pull from batsman, lands bowler over the mid-wicket fence, brute power!"
101,"FOUR, edged and four, streaky but Mayank will take those. There wasn't a first slip, Buttler dived to his left from second, but can't get to the ball. On a good length and holding its line outside off, Agarwal just hung his bat at that, the edge bisected the keeper and second slip to perfection"
102,"FOUR, he's peirced the gap to perfection, just a tiny gap between the fielder at point and cover-point and batsman found it. Played with an open face, allowed the ball to come onto him and gets it in the gap past point"
103,"FOUR, edged and four, on a good length and in that channel outside off, drew batsman into the drive, he went with hard hands and gets a thick edge past the lone slip, rolls away to the fence in a hurry"
104,"FOUR, lovely shot, on a good length and well outside off, batsman gets a big stride forward and lifts it over the head of the man at mid-off, couple of bounces and over the ropes"
105,"out Caught by Nitish Rana!! A slight misjudgement from Rana in the deep but he's recovered really well here. The umpires want to have a second look. But I think the catch was clean enough. Soft signal is out, and we will stay with out. A back of a length delivery, batsman slogs it across the line and hits it flat and straight towards deep square leg. Rana is slightly guilty of sleeping on it. He doesn't really move from his position, expecting it to carry comfortably, and has to dive forward in the end. Snatches it right off the turf. bowler has struck first ball of a new spell. team needed that. batsman c Nitish Rana b bowler 60(34) [4s-6 6s-3]"
106,"FOUR, heaves the pull away over mid-wicket. He was quickly in position for that. Short of length from bowler and the ball just sits up. batsman drags it from outside off with a lot of muscle"
107,"FOUR, plants his back foot at least a couple of feet outside off, rocks back, and mows the pull through square leg. The footwork had batsman written all over it"
108,"FOUR, that will run away. bowler strays in line and bowls it on leg-stump. batsman simply had to glance it away past the fielder at short fine leg. Neat wrists"
109,"1 run, dropped! It's Nitish Rana in the deep. The ball flew towards his left and he was on the move but he got there with both hands. Exquisite timing on the short-arm pull from batsman. It's precisely that which gets him in trouble. Rana provides the reprieve. The ball actually hit him flush on the shoulders. That's quite an error. Huge moment"
110,"FOUR, oh poor ball. A short of length delivery which sits up around the waist and batsman drags it away past short fine leg. Big decision to get bowler in here"
111,"SIX, it's not working. batsman is just too good for bowler. His slower balls do work sometimes but this is just different class. batsman picks it up, waits on it and swipes it over deep mid-wicket"
112,"FOUR, he's absolutely crashed this through extra-cover. A full, wide ball with mid-off up. Not sure what the thinking is. Whatever it is, the execution of it is way off target. Misses the yorker by a long way and batsman pummels the drive"
113,"2 runs, fifty for batsman. This guy, huh, unbelievable. He comes off a 499-run series in Tests and now belts a half-century in his first IPL X innings. Clips a short of length off-cutter from outside off and rushes back for two"
114,"FOUR, rare error in the field from Pollard. It would actually be harsh in calling that an error for most fielders, but this is Pollard we're talking about. A mistimed slog from batsman. However, he still places it to the left of long-on where Pollard sprints and dives across trying to flick the ball in, but fails to get a hand"
115,"out Caught by Southee!! Another miscue, this time it goes straight to hand. Was it an off-cutter from Pandya? Might have been. It was there on a length though but batsman doesn't get hold of it and holes out at deep mid-wicket. The crowd erupts with ""Dhoni, Dhoni"" chants. batsman c Southee b bowler 21(14) [4s-3]"
116,"FOUR, how good is he! Susses out the plan from bowler based on the line he's been bowling in this over so far, waits on the ball and just slices it past short third man"
117,"FOUR, that's been dragged all the way to the wide long-on fence. Pure despair for bowler. He's bowled this so wide of off and to see the ball being swatted into the on-side is downright demoralizing"
118,"FOUR, there we go. batsman isn't to be denied for too long. A bit shorter than the previous couple of deliveries, and batsman pulls it away to the fine leg boundary. One bounce and over"
119,"1 run, dropped! An absolute sitter put down by Southee. Oh boy. They've already dropped Smith earlier. That hasn't quite gone well. Now another one. batsman miscues the full toss to deep mid-wicket where Southee doesn't have to move. Dear me"
120,"SIX, going, going, gone... Is there anything he can't do? It's a slower ball from bowler, batsman swipes across the line and muscles it over wide long-on"
121,"SIX, he's done it. A couple of sixes to finish the game off just when it was getting away from them. What a player! A full ball on leg stump, batsman whips it away with unbelievable timing over the deep mid-wicket boundary. Pune clinch the game with a ball to spare"
122,"SIX, batsman is looking in good touch, this was banged in short and on the stumps, batsman swivels across, doesn't bother to keep it down. He didn't look in complete control - but has enough to send it sailing over the head of the man at long leg"
123,"FOUR, cracking shot, on a good length and just outside off, batsman leans forward on the drive, seemed to have checked his shot at the lst moment. It went in the air and past bowler, beat mid-off's sprawling dive to his right and rolls away to the fence"
124,"out Caught by Rohit!! Soft dimissal for Mayank. A daft little shot - to be precise. This was a back of a length delivery outside off, the width was there to cut, instead, he attempted something of a forehand jab, doesn't keep it down and hits it straight into the hands of Rohit at mid-off. Not the start Mayank wanted in his new franchise. batsman c Rohit b bowler 6(5) [4s-1]"
125,"FOUR, clubbed, made a great noise as the bat connected with the ball. Length delivery outside off, batsman shuffles across and heaves it over wide mid-wicket, one bounce and over the ropes"
126,"SIX, that's easy pickings for batsman, width on offer from bowler. He stays in his crease, uses his hands to good effect, makes the most of bowler's pace and helps it high and over third man for a maximum"
127,"FOUR, lovely, this is exquisite cricket from batsman, back of a length and well outside off, he waits on it, opens the face of the bat and steers it to the left of wide slip, beats the man getting across from the deep"
128,"FOUR, cracking shot, short and wide from Krunal, batsman doesn't need a second invitation, hangs back and cuts it square on the off-side, beats the fielder in the deep with ease"
129,"FOUR, fifty for batsman. This was banged in short by Hardik, batsman took his eyes off the ball, still went through with the pull, almost went all the way, bounced just in front of the ropes. Hardik looks amused, that ball didn't deserve a boundary"
130,"SIX, stunning bit of timing from batsman and he gets just enough to beat Pollard's leap at long-on. At first instance, it looked like a simple dolly to long-on, the ball kept going and going. Pollard arched back one-handed, got a finger-tip, but the ball was always beating him"
131,"FOUR, cracking shot, batsman is off and running in his IPL career. On a good length and just outside off, he leans forward, presents the full face of the bat and drives it back past the non-striker, no need to run for those"
132,"FOUR, nicely played by batsman, width on offer from bowler. He leans into the shot, opens the face of the bat at the last moment and steers it behind square on the on-side, gets it past backward point and into the fence"
133,"FOUR, lovely, the reverse sweep in full flow from batsman, gets down low and gets it into the gap behind square on the off-side. It was picked up from the middle-stump line as well"
134,"out Caught by Suryakumar Yadav!! Second wicket for Kuldeep. One shot too many from batsman. It was the wrong 'un which was on a fuller length, batsman gives himself room to go inside out, the bat turns on impact and the ball skews towards long-off. Suryakumar runs around the circumference and pouches it cleanly. batsman c Suryakumar Yadav b bowler 15(8) [6s-2]"
135,"FOUR, a well-controlled pull shot from batsman. bowler did not get height on the short of length delivery, just above the waist and batsman got on top of that nicely, rolled his wrists and struck it behind square, beating deep square leg with ease"
136,"FOUR, Pandey tried his best, but the ball still found a way to reach the fence. Width offered outside off, batsman maintains a low base and drills it in front of square, Pandey runs across from sweeper cover, dives and flicks it in but the ball backspins and touches the rope"
137,"2 runs, in no man's land. The googly and batsman takes it on without reading, he charges down and goes across the line, the leading edge balloons up and drops in front of the incoming long-off fielder"
138,"FOUR, for the umpteenth time today bowler has landed it on a shortish length, sat up nicely for batsman, who cut it away fiercely square of the wicket. Timed it superbly as it beat the sweeper cover comfortably"
139,"2 runs, comedy of errors. First batsman gets away with yet another leading edge, goes on the bounce to long-on. He was never wanted the second and Karthik was almost near the bowler's end before batsman decided to go, Karthik makes it in and Kuldeep for some unknown reason doesn't throw it to Uthappa and batsman also survives. He's living a charmed life"
140,"1 run, fifty for batsman. 29th in IPL. Not one of his best. Quicker delivery on the stumps, clocked at 113kph, that's the pace of Bhatia. batsman is hurried into the flick and sends it along the ground to deep mid-wicket"
141,"1 run, dropped! Would you believe it? I have lost count of the number of chances batsman has got today. Flighted delivery on the stumps, batsman kneels down and sweeps to deep backward square, went straight to Yusuf and he split it. He was on the move a bit and that put him off. He's been whisked away from that position by a stoic GG"
142,"SIX, ends the over with a maximum. A much needed one for team. Bit of air on this and a fuller length meant batsman was able to get underneath that, he heaves it high and over the cow corner fence"
143,"1 run, batsman backs away and bowler follows him with a yorker, squeezed to backward point"
144,"FOUR, it is all going batsman's way. He might walk on water today if he wants and get away with it. A well-directed yorker, batsman brings his bat down and squirts it off the inside edge to the fine leg fence. Not far away from the leg-pole"
145,"FOUR, bowler misses the yorker and batsman is in no mood to let him off, doesn't bother to get his front leg in line with the delivery, just goes through the line and smacks it straight down the ground"
146,"1 run, batsman and bowler collide. Short and slow outside off, batsman cuts it on the bounce to backward point. Both were ball watching and batsman dashed into the bowler, bowler is down on the ground and batsman makes his crease. The team skipper goes back to check on bowler and the Englishman is fine"
147,"SIX, batsman picked the bones out of that. Length delivery right in the slot and it was a clean swing of the bat from batsman, lofted it with a straight bat and cleared long-on with ease"
148,"FOUR, batsman is playing a blinder here. bowler goes short and outside off, it was the off-speed delivery and batsman spotted it early, carves it up and over backward point. No need to run for those"
149,"FOUR, 16 runs off the over and not the best of outings for bowler on IPL debut. He finishes with 3-0-35-0. Once more the slower delivery is on the shortish length, batsman waits and cuts it behind square, splitting backward point and short third man to perfection"
150,"FOUR, off-pace delivery and once more batsman read it early, he waited in his crease and stayed leg-side of the ball, lofts it handsomely over the extra cover fielder. All timing there from the Tamil Nadu man"
151,"FOUR, batsman does a ABD. The reverse sccop. Full delivery and close to the yorker length, batsman switches his stances and sends it over the short third man fielder, almost went the distance"
152,"out Caught by Suryakumar Yadav!! A fine knock ends. He provided the much needed impetus to the innings. Deserved a fifty, but that's cricket. Short delivery that caught batsman by a bit of surprise, pulled it towards long-on and Suryakumar takes the easiest of catches. Raina pats him on the back as he trudges off. batsman c Suryakumar Yadav b bowler 47(25) [4s-6 6s-2]"
153,"FOUR, that's a shocker from Kuldeep and he concedes four runs. This was dropped short and wide of off, McCullum backed away and cut it straight to backward point. Kuldeep dived over the ball and ends up conceding a boundary"
154,"FOUR, batsman finishes off in style. Very full and outside off, batsman crouches low, opens the bat face and drives it square on the off-side, the field was up and that was played beautifully"
155,"out Caught by Y Pathan!! batsman falls and team have struck early. A nothing shot from the England opener. This was another long hop from bowler, batsman rocked back on the pull, didn't go through with the shot completely - was perhaps just looking to help it on its way, gets a fat top-edge, high and over mid-wicket. Yusuf ran back and completed an easy catch. batsman looks gutted as he walks off. batsman c Y Pathan b bowler 14(12) [4s-3]"
156,"SIX, massive, tossed up nicely by bowler, fell right into McCullum's hitting zone, he gets forward and clubs it high and over mid-wicket, went a long way over the ropes"
157,"FOUR, cracking shot, poor ball from bowler, drops this one short and wide of off, McCullum makes room and cracks it over cover, couple of bounces and over the ropes"
158,"FOUR, bowler has been too short today, drags his length down once again. McCullum rocks back and pulls him past the square leg umpire"
159,"FOUR, nicely played! Fraction fuller and on the stumps, batsman leans forward, presents the full face of the bat and punches it back at the bowler. bowler got a hand onto it, but it still beats mid-off to the fence"
160,"FOUR, this is excellent cricket from batsman, made room as he came down the track. bowler spotted it and followed him - batsman is good enough to tuck it past square leg, the man in the deep is very square and has no chance"
161,"2 runs, that will go down as a chance, but Kuldeep did very well to get to the ball, got both hands and lost control as he fell down. Would have been a stunner had he held on. This was short and on the stumps, batsman was making room for the pull, gets slightly cramped on the shot, hits it high and over mid-on. Kuldeep ran a long way back, stretched as he got both hands to the ball - but can't complete the finishing act"
162,"FOUR, Kuldeep can't afford to drop short on this pitch. McCullum rocks back and pulls it through mid-wicket, bisects the two men in the deep to a nicety"
163,"SIX, McCullum is in some form alright, comes down the track, doesn't get too close to the ball, allows him a free swing and he deposits it high and into the sightscreen. Another expensive over for the Knight Riders"
164,"FOUR, that ruins the over for bowler, leg-stump half-volley, all batsman had to do was get some bat on that. Once he did - fine-leg, who was inside the ring had no chance"
165,"out Lbw!! Kuldeep has his man. This was tossed up on the leg-stump line, McCullum was looking to turn it towards the on-side, the ball straightened and went past his inside edge, struck him low and in front of leg-stump, would have been crashing into the stumps. Easy call for the umpire and it's also time for the strategic break. batsman lbw b bowler 35(24) [4s-4 6s-2]"
166,"SIX, batsman gets going with a massive hit, Yusuf tosses one on the stumps, batsman gets a big stride forward, lifts it with the spin and sends it high and over deep mid-wicket for a maximum"
167,"SIX, back-to-back sixes from batsman, flighted delivery on the stumps, batsman gets forward and thumps it high and way over the fence at deep mid-wicket"
168,"FOUR, just goes through with a wild slog across the line, no timing whatsoever. All power. To Lynn's delight, it went in the gap behind the square leg umpire. First boundary for team"
169,"SIX, that's the batsman we saw in BBL. Full-blooded swing, clears his front leg, picks the length early and goes bang over mid-wicket"
170,"FOUR, stand and deliver! Half-volley in the slot, batsman won't miss out, watches the ball closely and dismisses it out of his sight"
171,"1 run, advances and compiles a well-deserved fifty with a ease to long-on"
172,"FOUR, both of them have just played themselves in such good form here. Full ball outside off, batsman clears his front leg and crashes it inside-out to send it to the wide long-off fence. Superb hand-eye co-ordination"
173,"FOUR, really ordinary bowling. It's a gentle short of length delivery on off-stump, the ball sits up for batsman who bludgeons it through mid-wicket"
174,"FOUR, awful from bowler. He bangs it in very short but the speedometer just shows 128kph. The ball was actually on its way down when batsman slashed it over backward point. team being clobbered out there"
175,"FOUR, down the track in a flash, right to the pitch of the ball, and driven so beautifully over the covers. The trick in the shot was that he delayed the charge and came out only when the ball was released"
176,"1 run, bowls it short from round the wicket, batsman pulls it away to deep square leg. 150 of the partnership comes up"
177,"SIX, way too many half-trackers from bowler today. Just can't get away with it at this level. Lynn rocks back and blooters it over long-on"
178,"SIX, that about sums their night up. McCullum makes a blunder in the deep and palms the ball over the ropes. A miscue from Lynn off a full toss, should have been taken at long-off"
179,"FOUR, short of length, probably an off-cutter, Lynn mows the ball in front of long-leg who comes running forward for the catch. But the ball drops well short and then bounces over him"
180,"SIX, flat, strong, six! Kulkarni misses his mark, bowls it in the slot and is walloped over long-on. Lynn can do no wrong"
181,"FOUR, that's spanked! The open stance helps him figure the line and length quickly, uses all his might to smash it straight down the ground"
182,"FOUR, batsman and his golf hits I tellya. This isn't off the middle, but that bottom hand power and the baseball swing takes it the distance, just one bounce and over the long-on ropes"
183,"SIX, boy, has he nailed it! You bet. 95-metre smite. bowler serves length and gets smoked for a maximum over long-off"
184,"FOUR, rank long hop, batsman says thank you. Short, down leg, batsman swivels and nails the pull behind square"
185,"FOUR, too much width gestures Raina as soon as he saw the ball flying over backward point. Tad short and Lynn pounced on the width on offer, slices the cut and gets four"
186,"FOUR, 50-partnership. Clears his front leg and goes bam over mid-on. Right out of the screws"
187,"FOUR, bowler Koushik isn't learning. Keeps landing it short and gets smacked. batsman rocks onto his back foot and all he needed to do was get it over the fielder, did it with sheer ease"
188,"byes, FOUR, keeps low and nutmegs DK, batsman didn't pick it, neither did the keeper, runs are runs"
189,"FOUR, sits on one knee and chips the slog-sweep over mid-wicket, excellent batting this from GG"
190,"FOUR, outside edge and four! Opens the bat face to steer, the edge flies to the right of Kulkarni who dives belatdely"
191,"FOUR, make that 20 off the over. batsman has raced off to 40 in no-time. A real dart on the pads, batsman milks it off his pads. Easy peasy"
192,"SIX, if that ball had voice, it would have pleaded: ""Chris please take me for a journey"". Lynn heard that and obliged, rubbish length ball outside off and the next thing Smith sees is the ball flying over deep mid-wicket"
193,"FOUR, stands tall in the crease and flat-bats a shortish delivery straight down the ground"
194,"SIX, in his zone and Lynn doesn't have any second thoughts. Marmalizes it with utter disdain, Roy came in the way to interrupt, he was never going to catch that. Never"
195,"SIX, the onslaught continues... Full ball, don't even look back Mr Smith, the ball has gone to Brisbane. Period"
196,"1 run, slower length ball outside off, Lynn drills it through cover and brings up a sparkling fifty"
197,"2 runs, short ball on middle, batsman jumps on the back foot and lifts the pull over mid-wicket. 4th fastest team 100 in the history of IPL, gee!"
198,"FOUR, bowler Koushik's night keeps getting worse. Fires it short and wide, Lynn gets a feather of an edge on the attempted cut, the edge runs past DK's gloves"
199,"FOUR, edged and four! Streaky way to get off the mark, but batsman won't mind. Seam-up delivery that shapes away a tad, batsman chases it with a slash and gets a fat outside edge. The ball flies between slip and short third man. First boundary of the innings"
200,"FOUR, shot! Uses the width outside off and bounce and elevates it over backward point to collect his first boundary"
201,"SIX, goes for the big whammy and succeeds. That was short and has been flat batted over long-on for a huge maximum. Pressure on the youngster"
202,"out Caught by Stokes!! The young man gets the big fish! A luring delivery tossed up outside off and the batsman looking to thwack it down the ground, finds the able hands of Stokes at long-off. That brings the game back in the balance. batsman was struggling to get the runs and pays the penalty trying to up the ante. batsman c Stokes b bowler 28(27) [4s-2 6s-1]"
203,"out Caught&Bowled!! Looks to go for the slog sweep, the googly undoes him and he manages a big fat top-edge. The high ball comes down for the bowler to pouch that. The trademark celebration from bowler follows. That was a disastrous strike for team as they had lost Amla a couple of balls earlier. The promotion didn't really yield the desired results. batsman c and b bowler 24(22) [4s-1 6s-1]"
204,"SIX, MAAMMAAAteamAAAHH! The Big Show has arrived. The showman lays the bat on that and crunches that over the man at long-on. That scaled many a light years before coming down"
205,"FOUR, backs away and then the sledge hammer does the rest. Just like a warrior, wields his weapon to axe the ball past the man at cover"
206,"SIX, slower ball, doesn't matter. That was a dead meat of a delivery and the batsman has picked the bones out of that. It's that time of the season folks - In the arc, it's out of the park. If it's in the V, it's into the trees. Remember the carnage from 2013 against team?"
207,"FOUR, PHHUUUUFFFFF! Such power. He bulldozes that one through the off-side and the man at cover had no chance as there was a lot of room on it"
208,"SIX, backs away by clearing his legs and then sees the ball like a football to have a clear swing at it. The ball soars over the long-off region for a maximum. batsman is taking it away"
209,"SIX, 50 for the combo! That was a short ball, never got enough wood on it but enough on it to send it packing just over the man at mid-wicket. There were shouts of catch it but that region was unmanned"
210,"SIX, the most powerful delivery boy is here. He has sent it packing over the cow corner region. Brutal sinews into that pull and the ball flies away into oblivion"
211,"SIX, has that gone all the way? An overpitched delivery and the batsman checked his drive with power on his bottom hand to hit it flat and just past the diving Christian at long-on. The ball landed on the cushion and the third umpire signalled it as a half-a-dozen"
212,"FOUR, short ball and the swivelled pull. Picks up the length quickly and pivots on his back foot to send it speeding towards the backward square region for a four"
213,"FOUR, 13 off the over after bowling a brilliant first ball. Length ball down leg, batsman gets inside the line and flicks it well past the short fine leg fielder. Easy runs"
214,"SIX, that has been slapped! Short of a length delivery, batsman dances down and wallops it over the bowler's head. Muscled it. Way past the boundary rope"
215,"out Caught by Manoj Tiwary!! First wicket down! bowler sees the batsman charge down and bangs it short. batsman is cramped for room, but still persists with his pull shot. Doesn't middle it and the ball balloons up on the leg-side. Tiwary, who had a good stint with the bat, runs to his left from deep mid-wicket and gobbles it up. batsman c Manoj Tiwary b bowler 14(9) [4s-1 6s-1]"
216,"FOUR, nicely done! Shortish delivery outside off, batsman hops, gets on top of the bounce and forces it wide of point. The ball races away into the fence"
217,"SIX, batsman is turning it on here now! He walks down and lifts this shortish ball over mid-off. The ball has enough wings to go into the stands"
218,"1 run, a very tough chance goes down! batsman prods forward and drills the cover drive. Dan Christian, at cover leaps to his right and gets a hand to it. Those are the ones that need to stick. Wasn't the case this time"
219,"FOUR, batsman has come out with a positive intent and that is paying dividends. Finds the gap beautifully on his cover drive. No need to run for shots like that"
220,"FOUR, four more! Safest shot to play is hit it down the ground. Sees the length on a fuller side and lofts it down the ground, left of the bowler and right of mid-on. Safe shot"
221,out Bowled!! bowler strikes! And he is off! His customary celebratory run. He bamboozles batsman with a googly. It tweaked in at pace as well. batsman doesn't pick the wrong 'un and is also late to bring his bat down. The ball cannons onto the stumps. Through the gap between the bat and the pad. batsman b bowler 14(9) [4s-3]
222,"FOUR, sloppy from Rajat Bhatia at short fine! He was put off by the appeal for lbw from the keeper and bowler. It was the slider which was very full. batsman just about brings his bat down and gets a bit of wood on it. Bhatia over-runs to his left and allows the ball to go past him"
223,"out Bowled!! Cleaned him up!! That was the ferocious inswinger and the batsman without covering the line of the ball looks to play across the line and misses. The sticks go cartwheeling and the bowler takes off with a hand in the air. He does it so often, does bowler. Superb bit of attacking bowling as he got the ball to land on the sticks and put the batsman on a tight leash. batsman b bowler 0(4)"
224,"SIX, good end to the over. A massive end actually. In the arc of the southpaw and the batsman comes up with an explosive response to tonk the ball over the cow corner region"
225,"FOUR, imparts his powers of guiding the edge where he wants. Is happy to stay away from the line, giving his long levers some breathing space and just slashes at a slanter. An obvious outside edge and an even more obvious empty cordon for some free runs here"
226,"out Caught&Bowled!! A tame dismissal. Quite typical of batsman's defences in the early part of his innings. One of those famed stabby defences, just that he cannot keep this one down. But Swapnil decides to help him to an extent, getting his palms and almost grassing it. A three-time juggle before he earns himself a story for a lifetime. The replays show it to be much slower, yeah batsman was made to check his defence causing the ball-lob. batsman c and b bowler 5(11)"
227,"FOUR, pure timing. And grace. With a sink down on a knee, Tiwary decides to free his arms at a wide overpitched delivery outside off in the form of a slice. Such is the meat on this that he doesn't even bother keeping it down. Almost all the way"
228,"FOUR, gets a long hop. A rank one. And all he has to do is decide where to deposit this one. Decides mid-wicket it is again to take the brunt. Ensures that he doesn't get up early and once again puts his spinning back foot to use in whisking it into the fence"
229,"SIX, and now he lets the off-side take the brunt. Patel in his response fires one out flat and wide. The mind-reader that batsman is, sinks and tonks it through the line"
230,"SIX, the wide yorkers. Prove to be the undoing of Natarajan here. Makes Tiwary reach out making him stretch every cell of his body in getting there. Boy o boy he does. And how. Slices it imparting all the momentum in lofting it over backward point. These tiny boundaries I tell you"
231,"SIX, he's smoking them in. With a gallop down, gets the ball sitting up in his arc and keeps swinging his bat. We are firmly into the baseball zone. Over cow corner"
232,"FOUR, they're turning it on. Tiwary joins the act now. Is mighty helped by a horror line always drifting down leg. Has to ensure that he gets some wood on it and he does it with aplomb. Gets enough to muscle it heave behind square and beat the lone man perched out there"
233,"1 run, clears his front leg and shovels it down the ground. The yorkers keeping him quiet(er). Nevertheless, the half-ton comes up"
234,out Caught&Bowled!! A smash back. And the perish. Patel smartly keeps denying batsman the opportunity to go through the on-side by firing it wide outside off. Gets the bat up flat on the slap down the ground. Too early once again and all he manages is the cue end that flies back to the upward palms of Patel. So the change in bats not quite what the side wanted at this point. batsman c and b bowler 50(32) [4s-2 6s-3]
235,"SIX, in the arc, and out of the park. You cannot expect the bowler getting away bowling length at this stage. And Tiwary keeps up with the tradition of dishing out the punishments. Sits up and swings it through the line in tonking it over long-on"
236,"FOUR, a real drag down. The Mohit slower back hander but half way down the ground. All the time for the adjustment and Tiwary does it in executing his crouched pull. Axar did get a hand in his stretch at the fence, the power imparted was enough to burst through a wall though"
237,"FOUR, oh dear. Spots batsman running inside and fires one way down leg. batsman with his stalking eyes always on the ball gets his bat out on the horizontal swiping mode and scoops it away"
238,"FOUR, more of the same. The ploy here from Sandeep refuses to change and batsman too refuses to stand up on his feet against this length. Does all he can to get under the ball and keeps his bat on the scoop. This time right over the keeper"
239,"SIX, a switch to over the wicket makes no difference. Pounds it short, pounds it wide and batsman unleashes the mighty forehand smash. The concrete on the stands taking a real beating here"
240,out Caught by Maxwell!! Shovels it to his doom. Only after having done his job to perfection. Sandeep gets the yorker right and batsman gets his bat down off a massive backlift in shovelling it out. Not quite the elevation this time with the ball flying down to long-on. batsman c Maxwell b bowler 17(8) [4s-2 6s-1]
241,"1 run, DROPPED!! The man at cover - Vohra had enough time to settle down under it by going back but he makes a meal of it. That was a nothing shot to a length ball and the ball scooped high up in the air and never scaled any distance. Vohra was put off by Natarajan at mid-off who was just beside him. The former could see the fast bowler from the corner of his eye and that was enough"
242,"SIX, OLLLLAALLLAAAA! That was some response from batsman to a short ball. He loved the aroma on the perfume ball and accepted it with glee. That drop might well be costly"
243,"FOUR, opens the face of the blade on impact and runs it down to third man for a four. Cheeky from batsman as used the pace of the bowler and knew his angles to perfection"
244,"FOUR, gets the room to free his arms and creams the ball away into the covers. No one moved as the ball sped away into the off-side"
245,"FOUR, creates room by going leg-sidish, got the room to expand his arms and then threads the ball away between cover and extra cover for back-to-back fours. Innovation and batsman go hand in hand"
246,"out Caught by Stoinis!! There you go! The young man strikes. Whatta moment for him. A length delivery slanting away, batsman looks to drive on the up, hits it uppishly and finds the safe hands of Stoinis in the sweeper region on the off-side. The fielder was looking into the sun, so he steadied himself, got a hand up to create a better vision and then gobbled it up. batsman c Stoinis b bowler 19(15) [4s-1 6s-1]"
247,"FOUR, shot of the day? Shot of the tourney so far? Pardon the exaggeration but that was serene from the skipper. That was a slower delivery and the batsman just leant his weight forward on it with a straight face of the bat touching the ball. The man at mid-on and at long-off dived over the ball to allow a deserving four to the skipper"
248,"out Caught by Vohra!! HUGEEEEE WICKKKETTTT for team. That was a leading edge as the ball held onto the surface for the batsman to not control the whippy pull. The man in the deep - Vohra, this time settles down and takes a smart catch at the edge of the boundary. It almost carried all the way. Pune in trouble now. batsman c Vohra b bowler 26(27) [4s-3]"
249,"FOUR, loose delivery. It's drifting onto the pads and all batsman has to do is help it on its way. team can ill afford these errors, especially when they're defending a sub-par score"
250,"FOUR, that's quite the blooper from Mills at third man. He might have taken his eyes off and the ball sneaks through him and over the ropes. Nice little glide from batsman, shouldn't have been anything more than a single"
251,"out Caught by Binny!! bowler rushes batsman and gets rid of him. Really tame dismissal actually. He's pulling on the front foot, the ball is onto him quicker than expected and it hits him right on the splice. It spoons up for an easy catch to long-on. Bangalore keep hitting back, they keep fighting. batsman c Binny b bowler 13(12) [4s-1]"
252,"SIX, that's a really good short ball from bowler. batsman is unable to control the pull as he tries to fetch it over his head and nearly holes out. But these are short boundaries. The ball lobs up to the left of Binny at deep square leg, who runs backwards and leaps across but can only palm it over the ropes"
253,"FOUR, yeah, Abdulla is in a fix here. He doesn't want to be bowling in Abdulla's arc, but there is no one out in the deep to protect the cut either. He ends up straying wide of off and batsman slaps it through point"
254,"SIX, now he gets closer to off, batsman goes down on one knee and wallops it over wide long-on. This is superb batting from the 19-year old. He's putting Abdulla under tremendous pressure"
255,"out Lbw!! The ball slides on with the arm, clips both the pads and up goes the finger. Morris was caught in the crease there to a flat ball from round the wicket, and then he made the mistake of playing across the line. That would have hit leg-stump. So Bangalore have struck back as soon as Delhi threatened to surge ahead. It's been that kind of chase. batsman lbw b bowler 4(5)"
256,"out Bowled!! bowler's got him the very next ball and he is absolutely pumped. This is serious drama in Bangalore. A beautifully flighted leg-break which drifts in on leg, the ball dips on batsman, lands away from him as he slogs and sneaks under him. batsman b bowler 1(5)"
257,"FOUR, batsman keeps stroking them beautifully at the other end. He clearly holds the fate of his team now. It's a full ball on off and batsman has timed the pants of it as he flicks it through mid-wicket. The placement is brilliant too"
258,"FOUR, bowler has erred big-time with the leg-cutter and Cummins gets him away. It's well down the leg-side and Cummins whips it over short fine leg for four. It was so close to clearing the boundary"
259,"out Bowled!! It swings one way, and then the other. bowler hits back with a vengeance. A good length delivery which is in the slot for the slog, but the ball nips in just a touch to cause the error from Cummins. He chops it back on off an inside edge. The crowd is right in this. batsman b bowler 6(6) [4s-1]"
260,"1 run, beautiful slower ball, it's all the more effective with Mills bowling it. batsman is deceived by the lack of pace and he has to reach out as a result. He skews it right off the toe-end to mid-on. It's fifty for batsman. Superb knock, but he has to go all the way"
261,"SIX, Rishabh batsman, you beauty! This is some stunning cricket we're witnessing here. He takes on the short ball, and pulls it away over the fine leg boundary. It was a thick top-edge there actually but with Mills's pace, it travelled"
262,"out Bowled!! bowler has done it. That is surely the game for the team. batsman moves across towards off, bowler may or may not have seen that but he fires it on leg-stump and uproots it. A real valiant effort from batsman comes to an end. He's dragging himself off. Got to feel for him. batsman b bowler 57(36) [4s-3 6s-4]"
263,"out Caught&Bowled!! bowler tosses this up and lands it far enough from batsman to make him reach out for the slog. The ball turns, takes a thick leading edge and lobs up. bowler doesn't leave it for anyone else, he runs backwards and grabs it so well. Made it look easy there. batsman c and b bowler 0(2)"
264,"FOUR, picked away into the leg-side again. bowler searching for swing, pitching it right up, but the ball goes on with the angle and ends up on the pads. He has to adjust his line. Too many freebies"
265,"FOUR, oh well, put the mockers on him there. But again, as soon as he tries to pitch the ball up expecting it to swing, he ends up on the pads. Whipped away gloriously from batsman over square leg"
266,"FOUR, that's flown between keeper and slip. Gayle, standing at slip, didn't even have time to react. It was too close to cut. batsman made some room and slashed at it off the stumps. Lucky to get away. Not just get away, he's gotten four"
267,"out Bowled!! Mills has struck. A fierce short of length delivery which skids on, keeps a bit low and nips back in from round the wicket. batsman makes room once more and has a slash at it but he's played over the ball by six inches at least. It pummels the off-stump. batsman b bowler 18(17) [4s-3]"
268,"FOUR, climbs from a back of a length, finds the outside edge pretty high up on the bat and runs away to the third man boundary. batsman was driving on the up there. Highly ambitious"
269,"out Bowled!! It's game on here at the Chinnaswamy! batsman has played completely down the wrong line of a full ball and is castled comprehensively. The crowd erupts. Rusty footwork from batsman as he presses forward to drive, the ball didn't seem to do a great deal. Might have held its line a touch if anything. batsman played way inside the line of it, maybe anticipating it to come back. The off and middle stumps are clobbered. batsman b bowler 4(3) [4s-1]"
270,"SIX, oh my days! This is thrilling cricket. batsman goes down low and wallops the reverse-sweep for six. He's known for this. It was right in the slot too after bowler flighted it up"
271,"out Caught by Stanlake!! batsman has been completely outsmarted. What clever bowling from Abdulla. He enticingly tosses this on up and ensures to keep it very wide of off. Seeing the flight, batsman is lured into having a go at it but he's not quite to the pitch of the ball and has to reach out for it. The ball turns away further, lobs up off a thick edge and is taken by Stanlake at backward point. Bangalore are making good inroads. batsman c Stanlake b bowler 25(19) [4s-1 6s-1]"
272,"SIX, holy smokes, the nerves these guys have got! First ball, batsman sashays down the track and wallops the ball over deep mid-wicket. He was playing with the turn, so not a bad option. But to do that first ball is something else. This is a roller-coster, this match"
273,"FOUR, short of length into the body, batsman swivels across on the back foot and helps the pull behind square. He's placed it in the gap perfectly. Fine leg and deep square leg have no chance. batsman taking Mills on"
274,"FOUR, cracking shot, nice way to get going, that should give batsman plenty of confidence, length delivery on his pads, he prods across and clips it in front of square on the on-side, beats the infield and rolls away to the fence"
275,"FOUR, batsman is at his best in the opening slot and he has started well for team. On a good length and well outside off, he leans forward, plays with an open face and drives it on the up, beats cover and rolls away to the fence"
276,"FOUR, Cummins makes a mess of a simple stop and concedes a boundary. On a good length and holding its line outside off, batsman went for the big drive, gets a thick edge over backward point. Cummins did all the running, slid and stopped the ball, but it hit his legs and rolled onto the ropes"
277,"FOUR, creamed, low full-toss from Morris, batsman waits on it, leans forward and punches it in front of square on the off-side, beats cover-point and rolls away to the fence"
278,"FOUR, much needed boundary for team, on a good length and angling back into the right-hander, he uses the pace on the bat, opens up slightly and shovels it wide of mid-wicket. Mishra put in the dive - but in vain"
279,"SIX, massive, Kedar breaks the shackles, this was well tossed up on off, right into the swinging zone of Kedar, he gets forward and sends it high and into the second tier - over long-on"
280,"FOUR, pushed through flatter and wider of off, Kedar makes room and flat-bats the slap - beats bowler and races away to the fence in a jiffy"
281,"FOUR, cracking shot, tossed up on the stumps, Kedar shimmies down the track, gets close to the ball and lifts it back over the bowler's head, almost went all the way, one bounce and over the ropes"
282,"SIX, 24 from the over. team needed something and bowler has gifted them a perfect launching pad. Kedar is in some form alright. This was tossed up slower and wider outside off, Kedar bends down his knees and clubs it high and over long-on, went a long way over the ropes"
283,"FOUR, cracking shot, that's Kedar's own version of MSD's helicopter shot. This was full and on the stumps, Kedar was deep inside the crease as he whipped it wide of mid-wicket, no chance for the man running across from long-on"
284,"SIX, freaky, this is sensational from Kedar, length delivery on off, he makes room by backing away and goes inside out over cover, went all the way over the ropes"
285,"2 runs, fifty for Kedar, this has been a superb innings, short and just outside off, he backed away and cut it to the left of point. Billings put in the dive, made the stop and fired in a throw at the striker's end, concedes another run"
286,"FOUR, mistimed shots are finding the gaps now, this was short and on the stumps, Kedar was late on the pull, gets a top-edge - the fielder at square leg was inside the ring and Kedar has managed to get it over his head"
287,"out Caught by Billings!! Lovely shot - but batsman has found deep mid-wicket to perfection. This was full and on his pads, batsman gets forward and whips it beautifully - but unfortunately for him, the placement wasn't right. Straight into the hands of Billings and he doesn't drop those. A small contribution from batsman - but a big wicket under the circumstances for the Daredevils. batsman c Billings b bowler 16(18) [4s-1]"
288,"FOUR, smashed, length delivery on the stumps, Kedar backs away and thumps it back over the bowler's head, one bounce and over the ropes"
289,"SIX, cracking shot, he's in some devastating form at the moment - Kedar. Length delivery from bowler, that's a cardinal sin for any bowler. Kedar gets his left leg out of the way and drills it back over the bowler's head, went high and into the top tier of the Chinnaswamy"
290,"SIX, he's done it several times for Kerala - he's showing why team picked him up as KL's replacement. Runs down the track, gets close to the ball and lifts it over long-on for a maximum"
291,"out batsman Run Out!! That was completely unnecessary from batsman and it has cost him his wicket. This was a floaty delivery outside off, Vinod got underneath it and drilled it towards extra-cover. Almost a catch to Nadeem, he doesn't go for it though, instead, stops it on the half-volley, the return to the bowler is good and bowler whips the bails off - with batsman miles out of the crease. batsman run out (Nadeem/bowler) 9(5) [6s-1]"
292,"out Caught by Chris Morris!! That's another huge wicket and team are losing their way towards the end. Lovely piece of deception from bowler. He followed the slower short ball with another slower ball, rolled his fingers across the seam. Kedar was backing away on the lofted drive, gets it right off the bottom of the bat, plenty of height but not the distance. Morris settles under it and holds on at mid-off. batsman c Chris Morris b bowler 69(37) [4s-5 6s-5]"
293,"SIX, batsman connects one finally! This was the slower full-toss from Morris, batsman backed away, got underneath the delivery and sends it soaring over long-off for a maximum"
294,"out Bowled!! Morris gets his yorker right and batsman's stumps go for a walk. This was fast, this was full and this was on the middle-stump line. batsman backs away on the drive, misses and simply walks back to the pavilion. batsman b bowler 10(8) [6s-1]"
295,"out Bowled!! Morris gets another wicket with a juicy full-toss. team finish with just 157 on the board. Mills made room on the drive, missed and the off-stump goes for a walk. batsman b bowler 0(3)"
296,"FOUR, lovely, just a hint of width outside off, batsman made it look bad by arching back slightly, frees his arms and sends the cut scorching behind square on the off-side, beats third man - running to his right"
297,"out Caught by Samson!! A high full-toss has got rid of the big Jamaican. batsman looked surprised, was looking to blast it over the top, can't get on top of the ball, it hit him high on the bat and lobbed over Samson at mid-off. He ran back, kept his eyes on the ball even as it landed beyond his shoulder, dives and clutches it with both hands. Chinnaswamy has been stunned into silence as the big man departs. batsman c Samson b bowler 6(8) [4s-1]"
298,"FOUR, that ruins the over for Morris, another full-toss, but this time on batsman's pads, he gets inside the line and helps it on its way. Nice way to get going"
299,"FOUR, cracking shot, back of a length and well outside off, batsman rides with the bounce and punches it in front of square on the off-side, beats cover and rolls away to the fence"
300,"FOUR, lovely, this is even better, on a good length and just outside off, Singh presses forward, drives it on the up and splits the gap between cover and mid-off. Good early signs for batsman"
301,"out Bowled!! batsman has chopped on for the second straight time in this tournament. On a length and just outside off, batsman saw the width, manufactured a bit more by backing away slightly, went with hard hands on the cut, gets an inside edge that bounces back onto the middle-stump. He was looking very good, but it means nothing now. Another promising start, but nothing more for batsman. batsman b bowler 12(10) [4s-3]"
302,"SIX, beautifully played, what made the shot even more special was that he didn't get to the pitch of the ball. It only allowed him to free his arms and lift it inside out over cover, went sailing all the way"
303,"out Stumped!! bowler has deceived batsman completely in the air. Anticipated that batsman was getting itchy and was looking to dominate him, shortened his length and beats batsman in the air, the extra bounce did the trick. batsman was completely flummoxed on the lofted drive and Pant is quick to whip the bails off. team are in a spot of bother now. batsman st Pant b bowler 24(24) [4s-4]"
304,"FOUR, cracking shot, that should release some pressure off batsman, comes down the track, flat-bats the short of a length delivery and lifts it back over bowler's head, a few bounces and over the ropes"
305,"FOUR, back-to-back boundaries for batsman, makes room to a length delivery on the stumps and swipes it over the infield, clears cover-point and rolls away to the fence"
306,"FOUR, wow. That sped off the bat. Smith breaks the shackles, stands tall and extends his hands into fierce punch, right off the middle and pistols away to the fence beating the sweeper cover fielder"
307,"FOUR, edged and four! Would've been swallowed by the first slip fielder, if there was ever one. Lovely flight from Rashid, drew batsman forward and takes the outside edge which runs away through the invisible first slip region"
308,"FOUR, short ball and punished. Smith picks it up early and nails the pull in front of square"
309,"FOUR, two fours in a row for Smith. This was a poor ball from bowler, drifts one on the pads, all Smith had to do was to get some wood on it, which he did and it races away to the fine leg fence"
310,"no run, brilliant work from Henriques. A direct-hit would've been interesting. A fuller length delivery on the stumps, Smith pushes it meekly towards extra cover, Moises dives to his right and throws at the non-striker, all in one motion. DK was backing up for a single and had to turn back and dive full-length to make his ground"
311,"SIX, Smith is finding his bearings now. bowler errs in length and dishes out a full ball right in the hitting zone, Smith frees his arms and launches it straight down the ground, pings the sightscreen on the full"
312,"FOUR, that's an awful ball from bowler. Offers width, by bowling it well outside off, Smith goes deep in his crease and carves it over point. 50-run stand comes up between the two"
313,"out Caught by (sub)Vijay Shankar!! Kumar strikes! Half the team side are back in the hut now. Smith runs out of patience, decides to take on Bhuvi. It was a slower delivery and the West Indian didn't pick it. Was early into the shot and went through it, skews it off the toe-end and slices it towards deep mid-wicket. Vijay Shankar, the sub, runs to his left and pouched it safely. batsman c (sub)Vijay Shankar b bowler 37(27) [4s-4 6s-1]"
314,"no run, oh nearly.. A communication breakdown between both the batsmen almost resulted in a run-out. A short of length delivery outside off, batsman slashed it straight to point, Kulkarni set off for a single, DK was ball-watching and sends him back. Yuvi, the fielder, was slow to react and fires a throw at the non-strikers end, misses the target and Kulkarni survives"
315,"1 run, wristed into the on-side, takes off for a quick single before being sent back. Rashid fires at the bowler's end and misses. The duo run on the overthrow. Karthik was in trouble had that hit"
316,"out Caught by Naman Ojha!! Two wickets in two overs and team are losing gas towards the end. A short ball from bowler, batsman went across his sticks and tried to lap/scoop it over short fine, doesn't succeed as he gets a faint nick and Ojha takes a simple catch. batsman c Naman Ojha b bowler 30(32) [4s-2]"
317,"out batsman Run Out!! Third umpire woken up for a run-out check. Kulkarni is struggling and has to take the long walk back to the pavilion. team are committing hara-kiri. Another one bites the dust. Kulkarni worked it towards mid-wicket and took off blindly for a single, his partner was never interested and sends him back. Rashid Khan, the fielder, swoops down on the ball, takes the aim and fires a direct-hit at the striker's end to catch Kulkarni short of his crease. Rashid Khan's dream day continues. batsman run out (Rashid Khan) 1(2)"
318,"1 run, silly running from the team batsmen. Could've lost another one. A short of length delivery outside off, Kumar toe-ends the drive to extra cover, takes off for a single. The fielder collects the ball and fires a throw but misses the target. PK had given up"
319,"SIX, this will do. Sinks low, gets under this slower ball and tonks it over the long-on fence for a maximum"
320,"FOUR, lovely shot, fraction too short from Bipul , batsman is quick to rock back and pulls it through mid-wicket, no need to run for those"
321,"FOUR, back-to-back boundaries once again from batsman, comes down the track, covered for the spin and lifts it over the head of mid-on, a couple of bounces and over the ropes"
322,"FOUR, lovely shot, banged in short and on the stumps, it sat up to be smacked, batsman makes room and pulls it over mid-wicket, one bounce and over the ropes"
323,"out Lbw!! Rashid has struck gold in his first over! This was pushed through flatter and quicker, the wrong 'un from Rashid. McCullum was down on his knees as he went for the sweep and missed, struck pretty adjacent to the stumps and it's an easy call for the umpire. The impact was in front of middle, would have been going on and hitting the stumps. batsman lbw b bowler 5(10)"
324,"no run, edged and dropped, that was a chance and Warner at first slip has missed it. It was a tough opportunity though, batsman went with hard hands, the edge was flying and to the right of the captain, he went with hard hands and shells it. Coming to the ball, it was tossed up invitingly outside off, another wrong 'un from Rashid, lured batsman into the mistake - but batsman survives"
325,"out Caught by Dhawan!! Dhawan has claimed a catch. batsman isn't going anywhere. The third umpire will have a look, the soft call is OUT. He has caught it cleanly, but has the ball touched the ground or did Dhawan get his fingers underneath it? The zoomer has been called for, it looks tricky, but the soft signal is OUT. If there's no conclusive evidence, it will stay with the on-field call. The third umpire is taking numerous looks at it. B2$ is the call. team have lost two of their overseas batting stars now. Coming to the ball, it was banged short and just outside off, batsman was rocking back on the pull, went low of the bat and looped towards mid-wicket. The ball was dying in front of him, but Dhawan does well to dive forward and holds onto it. batsman c Dhawan b bowler 31(21) [4s-5]"
326,"out Lbw!! Rashid is leaving the Lions flummoxed. This was the wrong 'un, pitched just outside off and spun back into the right-hander, batsman didn't read it one bit, played for the straighter one, beaten on the inside edge and struck bang in front of middle. The height wasn't an issue, the ball would have been crashing into the leg-stump. Easy call for the umpire and Gujarat Lions slip into further trouble. batsman lbw b bowler 3(5)"
327,"FOUR, cracking shot, a floaty half-volley from bowler, batsman leans forward, closes the face of the bat and drives it back past the non-striker, no chance for the man at mid-off"
328,"out Lbw!! Rashid is running through Gujarat Lions. This was the leg-break and batsman had no idea about it. This was tossed up on the off-stump line and spun back in slightly, batsman didn't read it, was playing for the straighter one, gets beaten on the inside edge and is rapped on the pads. The impact was in front of middle, would have been going on and hitting the top of middle. Rashid is on a roll and so are his team. The umpire has called for a strategic break. batsman lbw b bowler 5(8)"
329,"FOUR, cracking shot, that should release some pressure off batsman, comes down the track, flat-bats the short of a length delivery and lifts it back over bowler's head, a few bounces and over the ropes"

358,"FOUR, so deft. The cheek these days. Shapes up for the cut, or so we assumed but at the very last moment opens the bat upwards in a dab past the outstretched Parthiv leg"
359,"SIX, this was coming. With bowler keeping it short and wide and Pandey's orthodox cuts failing, he decides to arch back with a toe-rise and ramps his bat upwards in teasing the man at third man over the ropes"
360,"FOUR, just the hint of width. Enough for Yadav to sniff a boundary out of it. Throws the kitchen sink at it with a crack through the off-side"
361,"FOUR, the width is back. And so is the allied length that starts off from half way down. A wristy chop quite off the outside half of the bat. Hurries away through third man"
362,"SIX, oh boy. Smoked one down. For a change he stays put in his crease without moving around and bends low in plundering what should have been a yorker. A vicious bat swing in tonking it into the black screen"
363,"FOUR, and now he toys around further. bowler responds with a length delivery outside off and Pandey after threatening to muscle another one out, stays composed and guides it behind point"
364,"out Caught by Pollard!! The sucker ball. On the umpteenth occasion a set batsman perishes after the team passes on a strategy in the break. Can't blame Yadav for anticipating the toe-crushing yorker. He gets one just that there is no pace at all on this one. Swings through his shot, gets one hand off the handle and eventually watches the ball pick out Pollard to perfection at long-on. batsman c Pollard b bowler 17(15) [4s-2]"
365,"1 run, here's his half-ton. Playing a vital hand here. Gets there with a flat batted agricultural heave. Then watches all his effort neutralized by the ball finding deep mid-wicket on the bounce"
366,out Caught by Pollard!! The wheels falling off here. Looks for his favoured flat batted pull through cow corner. Does get it right but neither manages the elevation nor does he keep it down. Yet another batsman picks out Pollard at the fence. The ploy of keeping it short and slow doing the trick out here. batsman c Pollard b bowler 9(8)
367,"SIX, a sink, a swing and a crowd deposit. Picks out the predictable off-spinner and waits for the ball to get into his arc. Unleashes a full bat swing and goes through with it in holding the pose as he drills one several rows into the cow corner stands"
368,"SIX, the sitting up length. Right where he wanted to and with all the pace on it as well for it to be dealt with severity. A full-blooded pull and just the sound ensures the maximum"
369,"SIX, misses the mark yet again. A yorker attempted only to be missed by a cool few centimeters. Ample time for Pandey to settle himself under it as he hammers it over long-on. Just cannot keep it down"
370,"no ball, FOUR, he oversteps and then bowls it in the arc as well. More of the sunken bat swings in intercepting the two men at the leg-side fence. Pandey with help here from the bowler giving team the final catapult. Free hit coming up"
371,"FOUR, a full toss now. Nothing coming out right here. Tailing away and Pandey is more than glad to use the width in just tickling it past the keeper"
372,"FOUR, offers some width to batsman, who will not miss out on these. Reaches out and bullies it with serene timing through cover"
373,"FOUR, yes he can! bowler is not learning, doles out a friendly full toss on off, batsman opens the bat face and slices it behind point"
374,"out Lbw!! Dead straight. Just that it goes onto the pad after smashing the bat. A yorker on the stumps, quite where he should have been right from the start. batsman tries hard in getting his bat down in digging it out. Almost does well in the end, gets right off the toe-end to ricochet onto his boot. Too quick for the umpire to spot it as well. Never mind. team finish with 178. batsman lbw b bowler 1(2)"
375,"FOUR, two in a row for batsman. This was streaky but the team captain won't mind. Pitched up full outside off, batsman went hard on the drive, gets an outside edge that races away to the third man fence. The fielder was squarer and had no chance"
376,"SIX, there he goes! Loads up big, gets under this short ball and dismisses it into the deep mid-wicket stands. Into the top-tier"
377,"out Caught by McClenaghan!! batsman combusts. The ploy of bringing in a spinner early in the innings has paid rich dividends for Mumbai. batsman, in an attempt to go big, miscues one and hits it straight to square leg. McClenaghan times his jump to perfection, leaps and takes a smart catch. Pandya exults in delight.batsman c McClenaghan b bowler 19(13) [4s-3]"
378,"FOUR, this was quite intentional from Robbie. Plants his front foot forward, looking to defend. The ball came in with the angle, takes the outer half of his willow and runs away to the third man fence"
379,"out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! Two wickets in the over. batsman falls cheaply. This was floated up much fuller from KP, tempting batsman to go for the big shot. The Karnataka batsman went after it, albeit didn't find the sweet spot in his willow. Skies it as far as deep mid-wicket, where his brother Hardik swallows it up with ease. Pandya roars in joy and sprints up to his brother and leaps onto him. What a start for Mumbai. batsman c Hardik Pandya b bowler 4(3) [4s-1]"
380,"FOUR, oh boy! bowler has been Lynn-ed here. If there is ever a term like that. Just stands still, unleashes a strong bottom-hand to slap it through extra cover. Bulleted away to the fence"
381,"out Lbw!! Boom! bowler strikes. Its the dangerous Lynn who has to walk back to the hut. The crowd find their voices back. Lynn makes a blunder by walking across his sticks, bowler kept it simple, bowled full and raps him low on the pad. Was beaten for pace and was struck right in front of middle. Lynn is disappointed. Big wicket for the home team. batsman lbw b bowler 32(24) [4s-3 6s-1]"
382,"FOUR, poor delivery from bowler to follow-up. Short, wide and Parthiv is right on top of it, cracks the cut behind square and third man was only picking it up from the rope. team are off and running"
383,"FOUR, inswinger which is slightly off target and batsman puts it away with ease. Full and swinging into the pads, flicked through mid-wicket to open his account. Not a muscle moved"
384,"FOUR, this time Krunal is in position much quicker, the line is different too - more around off and middle - and he's able to muscle the pull away through mid-wicket"
385,"FOUR, consecutive fours to finish the over. team desperately need some momentum here. I think bowler is getting a bit carried away. Bowls it full on the pads and Krunal whips him over mid-wicket"
386,"FOUR, a little bit of air from Kuldeep, Rana quickly bends his knees and swipes it to the wide long-on boundary. The length was a bit too full from Kuldeep there"
387,"SIX, oh what a shot! 23 off the last two overs now. A good little burst from these two. Kuldeep still flights the ball up, the line is outside off and Rana goes through the line to cream it beautifully over extra-cover. What timing on that. Way into the stands"
388,"out Caught by Uthappa!! bowler has strangled him down leg. What a lucky breakthrough to end a fledgling partnership. Back of a length on leg-stump, Krunal tries to help it along into the fine leg boundary but the deflection is only a small one. A faint little tickle off the inside edge straight to the keeper. batsman c Uthappa b bowler 11(6) [4s-2]"
389,"SIX, all the way. If you're going short to batsman, it better be nice and high. This one sits up around his chest and he dismisses it from his presence over the mid-wicket boundary"
390,"no run, uh oh! A bad mix-up there with batsman being sent back from the middle of the pitch. But he makes it home. The throw isn't a great one from Pathan either. Rana called him initially but then backtracked as batsman steered it to point. These are nervy times"
391,"FOUR, bowler bowls short first up to surprise him, but batsman is quickly into position. He's able to swivel outside the line of the ball which is on leg-stump and helps the pull to the fine leg boundary. It's rocketed through"
392,"out Caught by (sub)Rishi Dhawan!! What a huge wicket right after the break. The major threat of batsman is gone, and team will really back themselves now to seal this. Not sure if this was the plan, or bowler just executed it incorrectly. He bowls it short and wide, batsman throws his bat at and the top-edge flies down for a comfortable catch to third man. Massive moment. batsman c (sub)Rishi Dhawan b bowler 17(17) [4s-1 6s-1]"
393,"FOUR, moves away from the line of the short of length off-cutter, creates some room and flays it away over extra-cover. Rana keeping Mumbai afloat"
394,"1 run, bowler botches a run-out opportunity! He just had to collect the ball cleanly. Rana was well short. Rana couldn't find any elevation as he tried to flat-bat the back of length delivery and he hit it straight to mid-off. Never a run there, but the non-striker had come a long way down so Rana obliged. Would have been gone"
395,"FOUR, that's been absolutely spanked through extra-cover. The ball has left a vapour trail. Short and wide from bowler, Pandya smokes it while backing away"
396,"FOUR, brilliant timing! Low full toss wide of off, Rana reaches out and slices it past backward point. It skimmed off the bat"
397,"SIX, 10 off 2 balls. This game isn't over yet. Not while Rana is there. bowler is struggling to execute the yorker. He delivered a low full toss last ball, now a proper full toss at the stumps. Rana picks it away effortless over long leg"
398,"SIX, length from bowler and it disappears way back over mid-wicket. The team dugout is on its feet. What a blow from Pandya. But this is ordinary death bowling. Seam-up and good length, right there in the slot"
399,"SIX, lapped over the keeper for six! Thrilling stuff. Rana has stooped across and picked this full toss from middle-stump. It came right off the middle"
400,"FOUR, full toss again and this time he lofts it over extra-cover. Although the timing isn't quite there, he just had to clear the fielder in the circle. No chance for the fielder running across from sweeper cover. It's fifty for Rana too. The crowd going bonkers"
401,out Caught by Narine!! That roar from bowler drowned the whole of Wankhede by itself. Rana backs away to a low full toss on middle and spears it straight to point. He had timed the pants off it but couldn't have found the fielder any better. His stunning innings comes to an end. Oh what a game! batsman c Narine b bowler 50(29) [4s-5 6s-3]
402,"SIX, low full toss again and Hardik flogs it over square leg. He is 18 off 5. What a blinder!"
403,"FOUR, that is probably the blunder which will cost team the match. It shouldn't have been any more than a single. A low full toss which Hardik can't find any elevation with. He smacks it down to long-on, where Surya attacks the ball nicely but he misfields and the ball sneaks through"
404,"2 runs, this is very, very ordinary from team in the field. The substitute Rishi Dhawan is the culprit this time. He drops a skier. Another brilliant short ball, rushes Hardik on the pull and takes a thick top-edge to deep square leg. Dhawan looks nervous under the ball, slips a bit and then has to dive to his left after the misjudgement. Makes a hash of it"
405,"FOUR, full on the pads, and Hardik has done it! He whips it away past a diving Rajpoot at the fine leg boundary before running down and cutting a pose for the camera"
406,"FOUR, a shot that should make him feel better. bowler errs in his length slight and that is enough for Parthiv to punish him, driven beautifully wide of mid-off and the ball raced away to the fence"
407,"1 run, direct hit and Parthiv was running back. Finally he connects with one of his heaves, not middled though and finds Yusuf at mid-wicket. The shy is at the bowler's end and it is way off target"
408,"SIX, batsman clearly has the wood on his England team mates. Stokes in the first game and now bowler. A little shuffle and a crouch down to scoop this length delivery over short fine. The connection was such that it travelled the distance"
409,"FOUR, rank long hop to start bowler's spell, Parthiv picked the bones out of the pull shot, rocks back and nails it wide of the mid-wicket fielder. No need to run for those"
410,"2 runs, the new opening combo for team has registered a 50-run stand in only their second game together. batsman works it away with the spin wide of long-on and the second was on"
411,"SIX, batsman surely picked that from bowler. It was the off-spinner and he played it with the turn, plants his foot across and whips it over the cow corner fence for a maximum. This was more timing than power from the Englishman"
412,"SIX, finally Parthiv connects with one and sends it into the crowd. Floated up just outside off, Parthiv sinks to one knee and slog sweeps it over deep mid-wicket. GG certainly didn't like it"
413,"out Lbw!! Kuldeep can't be kept quiet for too long these days. He provides the first breakthrough for team and ends Parthiv's hit-and-miss innings. It was the wrong 'un and Parthiv shuffled across to sweep, missed and is rapped on the pads. The question was whether the impact was in-line, umpire Nandan thought so and raised his finger. batsman lbw b bowler 30(27) [4s-3 6s-1]"
414,"FOUR, a freebie from Kuldeep to welcome Rana. Googly which is short and down leg, Rana went for the big pull and under edge it fine. The man in the deep was square and had no chance"
415,"out Lbw!! Two wickets in two overs. The bowling change has worked for team and GG. The UP lad gets rid of the dangerous batsman, who makes a start and gets out, again. A full toss that tailed back in, batsman was beaten for pace as he missed the flick. The ball struck him in front of leg-stump. Not sure if it would have gone on to hit the sticks. But the finger was raised and he walks back. batsman lbw b bowler 28(22) [4s-1 6s-2]"
416,"out Lbw!! batsman is not walking. He's not pleased with the decision. Has some choice words to say to umpire Nandan. ""That's an absolute shocker,"" says KP on air and he's right. Massive inside edge onto the pad. Two poor decisions in two overs might have just cost team the game. The off-break which turns back in and cramps batsman for room, he hurriedly brings his bat down and smashes it into his pads. The umpire didn't spot it and gave it out after a thought. batsman was fuming after the decision. Even showed his bat to the umpire gesturing he hit it. But you can't overturn an onfield decision unless you have the DRS and that is not available in the IPL. This wicket has to be the game changing moment. batsman lbw b bowler 2(6)"
417,"FOUR, batsman is off and running. bowler loses his radar and sprays it on the pads, batsman will not miss out on those. Just nonchalantly whips it past square leg. The ball raced away to the fence at MACH 3"
418,"FOUR, fabulous shot from batsman. Don't offer him width, not even half a foot. If you give him half a foot, he will take it into a mile. Just extends his hands and lifts it effortlessly over extra cover"
419,"SIX, that has gone flying into the third tier. Just slid on with the arm, batsman picked the bones out of it, thumping it high and handsome into the long-on stands"
420,"1 run, dropped by backward point, a real sitter, team fans can't believe it! Full and wide, Maxi slices the drive sitting deep inside his crease, it went flat and straight to Mandeep Singh. He was a tad slow to react, straight in and straight out"
421,"FOUR, it's down the leg side and batsman tickles it away for four! The man at fine leg had no chance. A fine fifty from the South African. This knock has ensured that team are chasing this down without much of a problem"
422,"FOUR, plenty of width on offer and batsman takes full toll of it, stands tall in his crease and smacks the leather over extra cover. Take four!"
423,"FOUR, that's fodder! Maxi wants to finish it off ASAP. Uses the strong bottom hand to whip it in the air over mid-wicket, one bounce and over the ropes"
424,"SIX, this could be over pretty soon. batsman is surely relishing captaincy, Australia are you watching? Clears his front leg and smites the heck off a short delivery, backs away and makes a clean connection, goes seething over a helpless third man"
425,"SIX, brute! That's massacred! Maxi is in some form. Watches the ball like a hoop, once he picked the length (short) it was all about connection; that was marmalized, flat and flying over backward point"
426,"SIX, #team make a mockery of team's 148, ABD's 46-ball 89, win by 8 wickets with 33 balls to spare. Maxi is blasting it all around the park, puts the finishing touches with a brutalizing maximum over long-off. Got underneath a flat delivery and killed it...Watto smiles as he shakes hands with his dear friend. Lo! That's all he can do at the moment"
427,"SIX, you will see those often especially when bowler is bowling at such pace. batsman is not afraid, goes for a pull off the front foot, gets a fat top-edge that flies over the third man fence. Blades these days! I tell you.."
428,"FOUR, in the airrr and just over a leaping Negi. batsman would've had his heart in his mouth for a moment. A short of length delivery outside off, there was width on offer so batsman went after for a rasping cut. Didn't bother to keep it down but luckily for him it flies over the point fielder"
429,"FOUR, almost.. bowler overcorrects his length, bowls fuller this time. batsman flexes his arms and lifts it over mid-off. Just clears the fielders and runs away to the fence"
430,"FOUR, third boundary of the over. bowler is not learning. This was much straighter, he is looking for some swing which is non existent at the moment. Full on the pads, batsman gets inside the line and tickles it away to the fine leg fence. The fielder was inside the ring and bowler shouldn't have bowled it there"
431,"FOUR, threads the gap this time. Pure class from batsman. Stands still and lets his hands do the talking. Punches a back of a length delivery crisply through cover-point, beats the packed off-side field"
432,"1 run, goes wide of the crease and angles one on the pads, clipped away sweetly to deep square leg. 50-up for Punjab"
433,"SIX, in the airrrr and dropped. Mills is furious. Stanlake is the culprit. Don't even look at the bowler. A short ball down leg, batsman swivels across and pulls, hits it straight to fine leg. Stanlake prances to his right, goes reverse-cupped but makes a royal mess of it. The ball bursts through his fingers and what's worse is, it carries over the fence"
434,"FOUR, wow. Elegance written all over it. Shot of the day so far. Mills bowls a half-volley on the stumps, batsman leans forward, presents a full bat face and drives it smoothly down the ground, beats mid-on"
435,"out Lbw!! Number one down. A premature end to batsman's innings. Mills is chuffed to bits, lets out a huge roar. It was full and straight, the back of the hand slower ball from Mills. batsman misjudged it completely. Shuffled across his sticks and plays down the wrong line. Misses it and is struck low on the pad. Looked pretty adjacent and umpire Anil Chaudhary raises his dreaded finger. batsman lbw b bowler 34(21) [4s-4 6s-1]"
436,"SIX, this one goes horribly wrong for Abdulla. Tries the chinaman, but drops it on a shortish length, Patel spots it. He pivots back and muscles the pull into the deep mid-wicket stands"
437,"out Bowled!! bowler strikes. The experiment of sending Patel up the order fails. It was the googly from bowler, wasn't quite short. Patel went for the encore, not the ideal length. He misses and the ball rattles the stumps. bowler exults! batsman b bowler 9(6) [6s-1]"
438,"SIX, in the slot and out of the park. Pitched up just outside off, batsman was waiting for it, plonks his front foot forward and lifts it over long-off"
439,"FOUR, you cannot keep batsman quiet for long. He gets into business, full at 146kph, batsman clears his front leg and bludgeons it back over the bowler's head. Brutal from Maxi!"
440,"SIX, wow! What a strike. Full and outside off, batsman engineers room and slices it with an open bat over extra cover. Such is the power that it carries all the way"
441,"out Bowled!! And that's a beautiful delivery to get rid of batsman. He beat him in the air. Lovely change of pace from bowler. The previous ball came at 100kph, this was nicely floated up, batsman was early into the cut, didn't turn much, anyway was too close to cut and he chops it back onto the sticks off an inside edge. So the ploy to open with bowler works wonders. Disappointment for the team skipper. batsman b bowler 1(4)"
442,"FOUR, that was a poor piece of fielding from the man at third man. So batsman is off the mark straightaway in this IPL. bowler bowled a decent length ball outside off stump, just shaped away from the right-hander, batsman guided that with an angled bat past point and eventually managed to get a boundary"
443,"out Caught by Saha!! Can a wicket keeper take a wicket? He sure can. Catches like those should be awarded to the keeper. Short delivery, got big on the batsman, he went for the pull and managed a big plump edge. The ball skied upwards and stayed there till eternity till Saha circled under it after running back and then despite misjudging it, threw himself in the air to take it out of thin air. Superb take from the mitts-man. batsman c Saha b bowler 28(34) [4s-1 6s-1]"
444,"SIX, MAAMMAAteamAAAHHH! That has sailed over the long-off region. Out of nowhere, Mr. 360 decides to pepper the area down the ground and he got the length to smack it down the ground. Length to ABD is blasphemous"
445,"SIX, good length is synonymous to death in the death overs. Length ball and the batsman hacked the pull shot away to send it packing into the cow corner region. That was out of the top draw from the comeback man!"
446,"SIX, Mr. 360 is back with a bang! Short delivery, it was a dead meat of a delivery for the batsman who was on the back foot, he picked the bones out of that. Pivots on the back foot and then hammers the pull on the on-side for a maximum and with that his fifty."
447,"SIX, length ball and it disappears. That has been hoicked away into the on-side and that has landed many-a-miles into the deep mid region. He picked it up like he was picking roses in a garden"
448,"FOUR, goes inside-out and cannons the ball over cover for a boundary. That was a full ball outside off and the batsman thwacks the ball over the fielder to get another boundary. Even batsman joins in the act"
449,"SIX, cheers says ABD as he accepts the freebie from the bowler. That was a friendly full toss on the sticks and the batsman went across the line to smack the blow flat between long-on and mid-wicket for a maximum"
450,"FOUR, FIFTY for the combo! This man can do anything and everything with the willow. The pied piper of team treated the bowler as if he hails from Hamelin. That was full outside off and the batsman just steered the ball over the man at point"
451,"SIX, PHHUUUUUU!! 97 metres hit after he sank down on his knee to clobber the ball away towards the deep mid-wicket region. That was a low full toss and the batsman got under it to send it into oblivion"
452,"SIX, full toss, you don't want to know what happened to the bowler. That again forced the batsman to crouch low and trample the ball away into the on-side. That ball almost scaled the moon before it came down"
453,"SIX, his body lost balance. He was done in by the length, which was full, done in by the lack of pace but he reached out for it. He still managed to drag the ball away over long-off and a six it is"
454,"FOUR, in the airrrrrr and just over the leaping Maxwell at mid-on. Vinod is known for his audacious stroke-play. He won't mind playing his shots in any situation. Shortish delivery from bowler, Vinod smacks that from the crease, didn't get hold of it, more a sort of a pull shot it was, the ball just evaded the Punjab skipper"
455,"SIX, on the sticks, he goes down onto his knees and then the biggest of the night is unleashed as the ball scales some other orbit and disappears out of the stadium. Sensational hitting from ABD and team have something to fight with"
456,"SIX, oh my! That's a batsman special. How did he manage to time it so well? Looked like he was initially cramped for room, just moved his legs to the leg-side for a wee bit, somehow managed to get under that ball and loft it inside-out over wide long-off. Right then, he's moved on to 10 off 5. Good start you would say"
457,"no run, yes-no and the last thing team want is for Vinod to run AB out. Thankfully no damage done. He defends this back of a length delivery towards cover-point and blindly sets off, AB rightly sends him back and Stoinis' throw wasn't accurate at the striker's end"
458,"out Caught by Maxwell!! Good captaincy from Maxi. batsman hit a boundary that went aerial over mid-on in the previous over. Now he's placed himself in the deep and swallowed an easy catch. Disastrous start for team after opting to bat. Credit to bowler as well for dropping it short and cramping the batsman for room on seeing the batsman advance, Vinod wasn't in the best of positions to play, yet he went through with the hoick, totally mistimed it in the end. batsman c Maxwell b bowler 7(12) [4s-1]"
459,"out Lbw!! ""Aaaaah, aaaaah,"" goes bowler and the finger goes up. ""Definitely going over,"" says Pup on air, but quickly corrects himself to add, ""maybe umpire's call."" Body blow for team. Kedar was their hero in Bengaluru, he's out for a 4-ball 1 in Indore. Was that going over the top? Should the benefit of doubt been given to Kedar? This was the nip-backer from bowler, Kedar was on the hop, impact was just around the off stump and hawk-eye shows the ball missing the stumps. Another poor call from the umpire. We've had a few thus far in the series. Ask Mumbai Indians! batsman lbw b bowler 1(4)"
460,"FOUR, bowler missed the yorker by a yard or so and that was just what batsman wanted with the line being middle and leg. He waited for the ball to come and flicked it past the diving mid-wicket fielder"
461,"no run, another yes-no and batsman escapes. A direct-hit would have seen him walk back. He wanted to drive this short of length delivery through cover, got an inside edge to Amla at mid-wicket, AB shouts and sends him back, the throw was wide of the stumps"
462,"SIX, now then, now then! That's hit the roof of the stadium over the square leg stand. What a shot! How effortless was that? This short ball didn't rise much, batsman stood tall, swivelled and muscled the pull shot all the way"
463,"FOUR, and he gets lucky with an outside edge that runs away for four! No one at slip and third man can't cut that off. Natarajan bowled full and outside off stump, batsman reached out to meet the ball, the ball escaped off the edge"
464,"out Caught by Dhoni!! Look at him go. Surely he's inspired by a certain South African in his team - Imran Tahir. As soon as he sees Dhoni complete the catch, bowler is off on a celebratory run. Runs past almost all his mates. Good length ball in the channel around off, batsman has a needless poke at that, the hint of away movement takes the edge and Dhoni does the rest behind the stumps. batsman does not trouble the scorers and team have an early wicket. batsman c Dhoni b bowler 0(5)"
465,"FOUR, classy stuff from batsman. Nothing much wrong with the delivery. Good length ball around off, batsman allowed it to do its bit before opening the bat face and directing it past the backward point fielder. Used the pace on the ball and timed it beautifully"
466,"FOUR, consecutive boundaries for batsman. That should calm the nerves. Overpitched and bowler is punished, batsman strides forward and creams the square drive through the packed off-side field. No need to run for that"
467,"FOUR, tosses it up slow on middle and leg. Overpitched as well. batsman waits for the ball and drills it down the track. No chance for the long-on fielder"
468,"SIX, hits it and poses for the photographs does batsman. That's Instagrammable. Full delivery with no pace behind it. He clubbers it over the bowler's head and the ball sails over the sightscreen. First maximum of the day"
469,"SIX, second six of the over and batsman is turning the heat on here. Very similar to the first six. Full and slow from Bhatia. Once again, batsman thumps it down the ground and the ball lands wide of the sightscreen"
470,"1 run, just short of the long-on fielder and batsman reaches his fifty! Pitched up delivery, batsman lofted it over mid-on and falls in front of the diving long-on fielder. batsman collects a single to get to his milestone"
471,"SIX, that's a pressure-releaser! Brings up the 50-run stand in style! bowler overpitches and batsman takes full toll of it. Leans forward and sends it sailing over long-off for a gigantic six"
472,"out batsman Run Out!! That's brilliant stuff from Mayank Agarwal. The excellence cuts short batsman's innings. To start with, bowler bowled a wide yorker. batsman squeezes it out, finds Mayank at point and sets off. Mayank finds the target directly and batsman is well short of his ground. batsman run out (Mayank Agarwal) 31(22) [4s-1 6s-2]"
473,"FOUR, nice looking shot! Short ball, batsman has ample time to move across and pull it behind square on the leg-side. Well wide of the fine leg fielder. One bounce over the rope"
474,"SIX, that's a monster! Fired in on the legs of batsman and batsman deposits it into the mid-wicket stands with a heave. That cleared the boundary rope by a long way"
475,"SIX, welcome to your new spell says batsman! Length ball wide of off allowing batsman to free his arms. He is balanced in the crease and elevates it straight over long-off for a six"
476,"SIX, that's a stunning shot! batsman moved leg-side and bowler follows him with a bumper. batsman has no problems whatsoever as he hooks it over square leg. No fielder there and batsman collects another maximum"
477,"FOUR, highest score in this season! Cheeky from batsman! Low full toss outside off, batsman picks it and laps it well wide of short fine and the ball dribbles away into the fence"
478,"SIX, what a stunning way to get to your maiden T20 century! bowler bowls it quick, full and on the stumps, batsman moves slightly to his right and lofts it down the ground. MUSCLED"
479,out Bowled!! bowler gets his man and batsman walks back raising his bat. Gets a standing ovation from his team mates in the dug-out. It was a flipper that did the trick. batsman looked to pull it through the on-side and failed to make connection. The ball cannons onto the stumps. batsman b bowler 102(63) [4s-8 6s-5]
480,"FOUR, that's one helluva way to open your account! Leg-break outside off, Morris lofts it inside-out and gets off the mark with a boundary"
481,"SIX, that's a gigantic hit. For a moment, I thought it might go on and land onto the Pune-Mumbai Expressway. Fullish length, Morris moves to his right and wallops it over long-on. That went miles in the air and cleared the fence by a long way as well. High and handsome"
482,"FOUR, the gamble hasn't paid off. A wicket was scalped, but the overall result - 22 runs off the 19th over. Flipper outside off, Morris crouches and lifts it inside out. No chance for long-off"
483,"FOUR, that's a gross delivery! Short of a good length delivery with no pace behind it. Morris moves across and helps it away well wide of short fine. Runs away into the fence"
484,"FOUR, that's a brilliant stroke! bowler can't believe that. He didn't do much wrong there. It was bowled in the blockhole wide of off and Morris opens his bat face and drills the squeeze wide of point"
485,"SIX, wow! Bowls length and gets punished. On the pads and just a flick of the wrists. The ball has more than enough wings to clear the square leg fence"
486,"FOUR, batsman has come out firing. Picked the length early on the short of length delivery, got his front leg up and nailed the pull in front of square. That came smack bang off the middle"
487,"FOUR, fourth boundary in five balls for batsman. The start is getting better for DD. bowler overcompensates and goes full outside off, batsman is up for it and cracks the drive past the diving cover-point fielder. Sped away to the fence"
488,"FOUR, third boundary of the over and bowler leaking runs here. Short and wide outside off, batsman throws the kitchen sink at that and the ball flies off the outside edge, over Faf at slip and into the third man fence"
489,"SIX, fittingly Morris finishes the innings with a six. What a cameo this was from him. bowler bowls it short and Morris easily muscles the pull over deep mid-wicket. The man in the deep is just a spectator. Well that has been the story for the last few overs"
490,"FOUR, excellent batting. On a length and just outside off, batsman goes up and over cover, once he got it through the infield the result was going to be in his favour"
491,"FOUR, bowler too meted out with the same treatment. Good length ball outside off, batsman leans into the drive and places it square. It is a crowded off-side field and he's threaded that to perfection"
492,"FOUR, not a boundary ball but that's T20. Back of length around off, batsman crouches a bit and swats it away wide of mid-on, not off the middle but he had enough wood on that"
493,"FOUR, last over of the powerplay and batsman has decided to cash in. Advances and gets cramped for room, swings with all his might and drags it off the inner part of the bat to the left of short fine, Dinda can only escort the ball to the fence"
494,"FOUR, poor delivery this and bowler is made to pay. Sprays it down leg and that is easy pickings for any batsman, batsman stays inside the line and whips it fine. No chance for Dinda this time around"
495,"out Bowled!! And off he goes. Gets the crowd going as well. batsman is cursing himself off the field. It is yet another start for the Englishman that is not converted. It's always dangerous to shimmy down the wicket for a bowler like bowler, who generally skids the ball through, and that is what happened. batsman came down the wicket and bowler pushed it through, by the time the Kent batsman could get his bat down, the ball was past him and crashed into off-stump. The partnership has been broken and just the opening team needed. batsman b bowler 24(17) [4s-4]"
496,"FOUR, first boundary of the innings. Sweetly timed by Agarwal. Saw the ball dropped on a shortish length, pivoted back and flayed it through cover. This is a mickey-mouse outfield and it zooms away to the fence"
497,"SIX, take that! Says Bhatia. Gets under this short ball and smokes it over deep mid-wicket. Crunching sound of the willow"
498,"SIX, lovely shot, Pune need more of those, batsman skips down the track, gets close to the ball and lifts it high and over long-on for a maximum. Chants of MS, MS from the crowd.. Can he make a big score here?"
499,"out Caught by Nair!! When things go wrong, they go hopelessly wrong. Even his favourite helicopter shot has gone wrong tonight, that should snuff out whatever little hopes Pune might have had. This was tossed up invitingly by bowler, batsman cleared his left leg and whipped it off his toes - flat and hard, but straight to Karun Nair at deep mid-wicket. He didn't have to move an inch, accepts the catch gleefully. MS walks off, so do half the Pune crowd. batsman c Nair b bowler 11(14) [6s-1]"
500,"SIX, mistimed but six, batsman just got enough to clear the leaping Billings at wide mid-wicket, got underneath the length delivery, gets plenty of height and just about enough distance"
501,"SIX, back-to-back sixes for batsman, Cummins shortened his length outside off, batsman backs away, makes room and slaps it over cover. The timing is good and the ball sails over the ropes for another maximum"
502,"out Caught by Chris Morris!! Another wicket for bowler, he's having a better night. This was a floaty leg-break, went wider of off. Bhatia had to fetch that as he played the slog-sweep, went off the toe of the bat and it's a simple catch to Morris at long-on. Bhatia has a look at his bat and walks away. bowler is on a hat-trick now. batsman c Chris Morris b bowler 16(17) [6s-1]"
503,"FOUR, lovely shot, bowler tosses one wider of off, batsman gets a big stride forward and drills it through extra-cover, beats the man getting across to his left from long-off"
504,"out Caught by Pant!! Third wicket for Khan, he's having a ball tonight. Saw batsman giving him the charge, banged it short and on the stumps, batsman swung across in hope, gets a thick top-edge - simple catch to Pant. bowler has a few words to say as batsman walks away. The end is nigh for Pune. batsman c Pant b bowler 14(6) [6s-2]"
505,"no run, has Karun plucked a one-handed stunner? The third umpire is called for, the soft call is OUT. Looked like a good catch on first view. Has the ball touched the ground, has he got his fingers underneath? The third umpire is having a look at different angles, this will be a tricky call. NOT OUT it is. Fair call, looked like the ball might just have touched the ground as Karun plucked it. Coming to the ball, it was full and shaping away, squared up batsman as he was looking to work it towards the on-side, the edge flew to the left of first slip. Karun stuck his left hand out and claimed the catch"
506,"FOUR, batsman wants to have some fun, length delivery outside off, he gets forward and thumps it over extra-cover for a boundary"
507,"out Caught by Samson!! Another catch for Samson and another wicket for bowler. This was another leg-break, bowled slower and on the middle-stump line. batsman swung across in hope, he had to manufacture all the power himself, doesn't get the elevation either. Samson moves across to his right at deep mid-wicket and takes the offering. The umpire has called for a strategic break with just one wicket remaining. Not sure what the two teams will talk about over the next 150 seconds. batsman c Samson b bowler 5(7) [4s-1]"
508,"out Caught by Mishra!! The Daredevils have opened their tally and it's Cummins who has the final wicket. On a good length and on the stumps, batsman was backing away on the drive, doesn't get hold of the shot and chips it tamely towards cover. Mishra runs forward, dives and completes the catch. A 97-run mauling at home for Pune, they would love to forget today's display as soon as possible. batsman c Mishra b bowler 7(7) [4s-1]"
509,"out Caught by Samson!! Zak attack strikes! Glum faces in the crowd. batsman falls early in the innings, big wicket for DD. It was on a fuller length around off, it was the off-cutter from Zak. batsman perhaps went hard at it, the ball seemed to have stopped on the pitch and that must've foiled batsman's attempt there. Skewed off the toe-end and lobs a sitter to Samson at mid-off, who backtracks and pouches it safely. So, Zak gets the better of his counterpart. batsman c Samson b bowler 10(9)"
510,"FOUR, wow. Delicate stuff from Agarwal. Opens the bat face to this length ball and runs it towards third man, Sanju had to cover some ground, sprinted to his left but couldn't stop the ball from reaching the ropes"
511,"out Caught by Chris Morris!! The old warhorse gets his second wicket. Agarwal's poor form continues. He was scarced for runs, wanted to throw caution to the winds but doesn't succeed. Went for a on-the-up drive to a good length delivery that probably kicked up a touch. It was the slower ball from bowler that did the trick. He slices it straight to extra-cover, who took a couple of steps back and held onto it. batsman c Chris Morris b bowler 20(18) [4s-2]"
512,"FOUR, fabulous shot from batsman. Sets up a solid base and caresses it past long-off"
513,"FOUR, what a way to get off the mark in IPL for batsman. Leans across to a full ball and blasts it through extra cover"
514,"FOUR, edged and four. Morris is not happy. Throws a wild stare at the batsman. On a length and just outside off, batsman went hard at it, gets an outside edge that races away to the third man fence"
515,"out Caught by Nadeem!! Short ball consumes batsman. Morris picks up his first wicket. A lifter angled at the batsman, batsman went for the pull. The ball got big on him and he manages a fat top-edge that went up in the air. Nadeem from fine leg darted in and snaffled it with ease. batsman c Nadeem b bowler 10(5) [4s-2]"
516,"out Caught by Pant!! ""Ahhhh, ahhhhh"" goes Pant and S Ravi raises his finger. A big blow for Pune. Stunned silence in the crowd. batsman tried to be too cheeky, went low to play the scoop over the keeper's head. Gets a faint tickle and Pant nestles it into the gloves. batsman c Pant b bowler 8(7) [4s-1]"
517,"out Caught by Pant!! Gone! Three wickets in three overs and Pune are in trouble now. batsman bites the dirt. Cummins reaps reward for his tidy bowling. Again slants it wide of off, batsman went for a pull. Wasn't too short and all he could manage was an under-edge that was gobbled up by Pant. Smart catch, must say as it was dying. He bent forward and took it cleanly. batsman c Pant b bowler 2(5)"
518,"FOUR, slightly straighter from bowler and the batsman clips the ball away between mid-wicket and mid-on for a four. Hardly touched it and the ball sped away after he shuffled a tad across his sticks"
519,"FOUR, looks to defend and the ball trims the inside edge to run past the sticks. Cruel it is for the bowlers. The ball lifted up after landing on a length forcing the batsman to jab at it but the ball clipped the inner edge to run past the timbers and the keeper for a four"
520,"FOUR, serene! The format might demand slam bang wham. But a back foot cover drive with a lean into the shot and hitting it on top of the bounce is welcomed all day long. He trampled back to stroke it off the back foot"
521,"SIX, BOY O BOY! Clatters the ball out of the park after dropping down on one knee. The moment it hit the bat, it was heading one way - into the oblivion! That was again flattish and the batsman wasted no time in sending it away aerially"
522,"FOUR, he's sprayed it around a bit today, has bowler. Short and wide and gives away the boundary to finish the over. Slashed over backward point by Rana"
523,"SIX, wow! Just a flick of the wrists from batsman and away she goes. That's scintillating timing. It was a fullish off-cutter on middle stump and batsman whipped it comfortably over deep mid-wicket"
524,"out Caught by Dhawan!! He's whipped a pull straight to square leg. It was an innocuous short of length delivery into the body, not very high, and batsman usually is pretty adept at dealing with those. But this time it seemed as if he didn't go through with the shot. It's straight down the throat of Dhawan. Can team still turn things around? batsman c Dhawan b bowler 11(11) [6s-1]"
525,"SIX, oh that's a full bunger on leg stump, the dew causing the ball to slip out of Rashid's hand. So difficult. batsman swings it away over square leg"
526,"SIX, just clears long-on! He didn't get all of it, having to fetch it from outside off, but there was enough power in those shoulders"
527,"FOUR, 10 off 2 balls. bowler continues to be expensive. Strays just a touch in line, bowls it on middle and leg, and batsman glances it away past short fine leg"
528,"SIX, he's mowed that over deep mid-wicket. Back of a length, maybe a cutter, and it sits up to be whacked. Flat six"
529,"FOUR, very wide outside off and batsman somehow reaches out and then generates enough power to carve it over extra-cover. He's in a hurry now"
530,"FOUR, off the top-edge or the glove, the ball lobs over Naman Ojha and runs away to the boundary. batsman was rushed on the pull on this occasion. The line from bowler cramped him up too. But he still gets the boundary"
531,out Caught by Cutting!! He's holed out off a full toss. He swings hard but gets it right off the toe-end. It still goes pretty far and is caught just 5 yards inside the deep mid-wicket boundary. Cutting takes a smart catch running backwards and to his right. batsman c Cutting b bowler 37(20) [4s-3 6s-3]
532,"FOUR, lofted over mid-off! He picks the slower ball, the length was pretty full outside off and Rana's focus is purely on timing. Doesn't go very hard at it. Brilliant batting"
533,"out Bowled!! bowler knocks over Rana's off-bail. It hit nothing else but the bail. Third wicket for bowler. He's been fantastic again today. A little bit of nip from a good length, Rana was backing away looking to create a shot out of nothing and missed it by a long way in the end. He's played a fine knock though. batsman b bowler 45(36) [4s-3 6s-2]"
534,"FOUR, repeats the gait of the previous ball and gets an outside edge to run it down towards third man. He got wood on it and got it fine after just using the pace of the bowler. 15 off the over!"
535,"FOUR, errs in length, which is short, errs in line, which is wide. Enough said. The batsman cashes into the blank cheque of a delivery with the flay of the arms and stroked it beautifully through the heavily manned off-side"
536,out Bowled!! The batsman preempts by dancing down the track but he lost his dancing shoes in the process as the slower ball doled out deceives him. The wily old bowler rolled his fingers over the ball and the batsman trying for a cross batted swipe completely missed the ball due to the lack of pace on it. team get the first blood. batsman b bowler 14(11) [4s-3]
537,"FOUR, nicely done as he wristily whips the ball in the air over the man at mid-on. A few bounces and into the fence. A length ball it was and the batsman did it with nonchalance"
538,"FOUR, targets the mid-riff with another short delivery but the pint-sized dynamite is onto it in a flash! The short arm jab on the pull and the ball screeches away into the backward square region on the on-side for a four"
539,"out Lbw!! The wrong 'un and the team skipper seems to be at the wrong end of it again. First game: Tahir, Now: Rashid. The ball decked in after landing and the meek prodded attempt from batsman plots his own misery. The impact might have been around off even as batsman lunged forward on the defensive push. The teen sensation continues to bamboozle the men. batsman lbw b bowler 4(4)"
540,"SIX, banged in short, the batsman plays an awkward shot to pull the ball away fine on the on-side for a maximum. He had eyes away from the ball and then the evasive action with the bat coming down on it made good enough contact"
541,"FOUR, that was a chocolate brownie of a delivery and the batsman puts the icing on it with the help of an eyes-scream of a shot. Cut away easily past the man at point making the man at third man look like a statue"
542,"FOUR, the ramp now! He is pulling out all the tricks from his hat. Short ball bumped in well outside off and the batsman helped it on his way towards third man"
543,"FOUR, poor delivery on the pads and third in a row as the batsman clips the ball away over the man at short fine leg"
544,"FOUR, attempted slog sweep, is not really well timed but is well placed to send it away into the vacant backward square region for a much needed four"
545,out Caught by Bhuvneshwar!! Length ball tossed up and he has chipped it straight to the man at long-on who dives forward and takes a good catch. He gave the impression to us that it might have stuck onto the wicket a bit. But it was a bizzare shot as he just lofted it without any particular intent on the shot. End of a good knock from batsman. batsman c Bhuvneshwar b bowler 39(24) [4s-7]
546,"SIX, bring it on! Make a GIF of that shot. batsman swapped his hands and belted it with switch hit over third man, that's some hitting I tellya. Got behind it and gave it a full whack, bam!"
547,"out Caught by Parthiv Patel!! Not again! batsman tries for another switch hit and this time it doesn't come off, ends up playing it off the back of the bat as the ball slid onto him and then the heroics of PP. He anticipated the shot, moved quickly to his left and dived full length before nestling it inches above the turf. Stunning catch that. batsman c Parthiv Patel b bowler 49(34) [4s-7 6s-2]"
548,"FOUR, don't worry about that! Healthy width on offer, Hooda throws the kitchen sink and gets his christmas gift"
549,"FOUR, right in the sweeping zone for SD. He gets inside the line and thrashes it away behind square"
550,"out Caught by Pollard!! bowler's doosra does the trick, and boy is he happy! Does a cradle like celebration for his daughter, who is in attendance today. That was fired around off and middle, Hooda knelt down on knee and miscued the slog, was trying to clear long-on, but didn't get the distance. Pollard sets himself at long-on and consumes with ease. batsman c Pollard b bowler 9(9) [4s-1]"
551,"FOUR, batsman's getting better with each passing delivery, he steps out, takes bowler on and lofts him inside-out over extra cover"
552,"out Bowled!! No fifties for the openers. Warner misses it by a run and SD by two. It was a loopy full toss which dips under batsman's cross-bat hoick to crash into his stumps. Easily done. bowler has a wicket, been expensive thus far but this wicket should sooth his nerves. batsman b bowler 48(43) [4s-5 6s-1]"
553,"FOUR, no fuss from batsman! Arrives and gets a boundary, with utmost ease. A friendly full toss outside off, batsman shows the full face of the bat, bowler's pace takes care of the rest. Raced past mid-off"
554,"FOUR, a fielding blip from Buttler and that's a boundary. Yuvi knew what was coming with the field set, stayed on the back foot and unveiled the cut with a glitter of left-hander's elegance. Jos runs to his right from cover and dives, the ball slids through his fingers to add agony to a grumpy-looking Rohit Sharma"
555,"out Bowled!! Dragged on! Lands on the seam and gets the ball to angle away from Yuvi; making him fetch that far from his reach. Yuvi with his laden-feet went through with the pull and chopped it back onto his stumps, off the thick inside edge firing off the PUMA sticker. batsman b bowler 5(7) [4s-1]"
556,"FOUR, the gangly batsman makes his intentions clear. He wants to have a piece of slinga bowler. Waits deep inside the crease and bludgeons a full ball back over the bowler's head"
557,"FOUR, that's a wood chopper! Takes on a full half-volley and slices the whacky-drive over a leaping exra cover. Bhajji was the fielder and he may have got a fingertip on that"
558,"FOUR, slower ball alright, but serves too much of width. Ends up as a full toss, batsman chips it over extra cover, easy peasy"
559,"out Bowled!! The bowler special, batsman can't do much, just drops his head and walks off. Goes a touch wide of the crease and lands a perfect yorker, right at the base of middle stump. By the time batsman got his bat down, his stumps were already shattered. Phewf! batsman b bowler 20(10) [4s-4]"
560,"out Caught by Nitish Rana!! Way too early through his shot, played the shot on Monday, and the ball...Um! It arrives on Wednesday. Looking to flick, a healthy leading edge pops up to Rana at backward point. Simple catch. batsman c Nitish Rana b bowler 1(2)"
561,"out Caught by Pollard!! The wickets keep tumbling. Slower ball, in right-hander's swinging arc, Ojha got under it but he didn't give it a full whack. Relies on timing and chips it high into the night sky, Pollard is safe as a house at long-on. batsman c Pollard b bowler 9(9)"
562,"out Caught&Bowled!! bowler says ""It's mine"" and he makes no mistake. Charges out of his crease and clatters it, nowhere off the middle, it hung in the air for long and bowler had it covered. Caught it around the cover region. batsman c and b bowler 2(4)"
563,"FOUR, lovely shot, poor ball from bowler, dropped it short and wide of off, batsman backed away, plays with the turn and cuts it over cover, one bounce and over the ropes"
564,"FOUR, this is even better. This was not all that short but batsman made room for himself, stayed back and went inside out over cover, almost went all the way, bounced just in front of the ropes"
565,"FOUR, nicely played by batsman, it was the slower ball from bowler, rolled his fingers across the seam. batsman watched it all along, played with an open face and guides it in the gap behind square on the off-side, beats backward point and rolls away to the fence"
566,"FOUR, poor ball from bowler, too straight and on batsman's pads, he allows it to come onto it, closes the face of the bat and glances it fine, beats the keeper and rolls away to the fence"
567,"FOUR, cracking shot, width on offer from bowler, batsman waits on it, gets on top of the bounce, uses bowler's pace and steers it to the right of backward point. No chance for the fielder running across to his left from third man"
568,"FOUR, streaky and four, on a good length and on the stumps, batsman heaves across the line, gets a thick inside edge past square leg. The pace of this outfield is so good that it rolls away to the fence"
569,"SIX, cracking shot, length delivery on the stumps, right in the hitting arc for batsman, he gets forward and thumps it high and over mid-wicket, went sailing into the stands for a maximum"
570,"FOUR, cracking shot, on a good length and just outside off, batsman does a little shimmy, gets close to the ball and drills it wide of mid-off. No need to run for those. 15 from the over"
571,"leg byes, 1 run, short of a good length and on batsman's hips, he was looking to nudge and missed, rolled away off his pads towards square leg"
572,"FOUR, that's a bad fumble from Rana and he has cost his team two runs. Full and on his pads, flicked away behind square on the on-side. Rana did the hard yards, got to the ball and slips it through his hands"
573,"FOUR, back-to-back boundaries and it has turned out to be another expensive over from bowler. He got too predictable with the slower ones, batsman was waiting for it, cuts it hard and beats the fielder at point to his left"
574,"FOUR, inside edge and four, on a good length and holding its line outside off, batsman walked across on the swipe, gets a thick inside edge - past the off-stump and past the diving Parthiv. A hat-trick of boundaries for team"
575,"SIX, beautifully played, banged in short and angling across the left-hander, batsman backs away,uses the pace of Hardik and helps it on its way, no one in the deep and the ball sails over the ropes"
576,"FOUR, slapped, short of a length and shaping away from outside off, batsman plays with the angle and carves it behind square on the off-side, one bounce and over the ropes"
577,"FOUR, cracking shot, width on offer from bowler, batsman gets on top of the bounce and cuts it in front of square on the off-side, beats the man in the ring and rolls away to the fence"
578,"FOUR, edged and four, a third slip would have gobbled it up. Short of a good length and angling across batsman, opened him up as he looked to defend, the edge flew past the diving Maxwell at second slip, third man can't get across - despite the dive"
579,"out Bowled!! batsman attempts a cheeky lap sweep and ends up self-destructing himself. His captain doesn't look too pleased with it. This was tossed up on the leg-stump line, batsman went a long way across his stumps, bent down and was looking to lap it past the keeper, misses and the ball hits the top of leg-stump. Hushed silence at the Eden Gardens as batsman walks away. batsman b bowler 26(16) [4s-3 6s-1]"
580,"1 run, 33rd IPL fifty for GG. Equals Warner's record for the most number of fifties. Waves his bat around to acknowledge the Eden Garden crowd. Reaches the milestone with a wristy flick through mid-wicket"
581,"FOUR, off-pace delivery and batsman spotted it early. The length was short and with his open stance, it was always going to be trouble for Mohit, punched off the back foot in front of square and Axar at sweeper gave up the chase very soon"
582,"FOUR, what was Ishant doing? batsman backed away to the leg-side, bowler followed him with a short and quick delivery, batsman adjusted and ramped it fine. Ishant at short third man stood like a statue"
583,"FOUR, top shot! Just a caress and off she went racing to the boundary cushion. bowler tosses it up outside off and draws Pandey into the drive, the Karnataka batsman drives it handsomely through extra cover and beat a quick David Miller at sweeper cover"
584,"FOUR, slower short ball and Pandey had all the time in the world to dismiss it from his presence, delays the pull and sends it along the turf behind square, well wide of the deep square leg fielder"
585,"FOUR, that's bread and butter for batsman. Short, wide and he cracks it away. Went back in his crease and unleashed the cut shot behind square, beating backward point and third man quite comfortably"
586,"SIX, team complete a stunning 8-wicket win. Their eighth win on the trot against team. Pandey brings up the winning runs in style, picks the slower delivery and swipes it flat over long-on. The fielder there was a mere spectator"
587,"SIX, lovely, batsman was sent in to do some pinch-hitting and he's doing exactly that. Length delivery outside off, batsman gets forward, drives it through the line and sends it high and over the fence at long-off"
588,"FOUR, cracking shot, hint of width outside off, the length was on the shorter side as well, batsman gets on top of the bounce and cuts it in front of square on the off-side, beats the fielder at point and rolls away to the fence"
589,"FOUR, this is turning out to be an excellent start from team. Sandeep overcompensates and bowls one full and wide of off, batsman shimmies down the track, gets down on one knee and drills it past extra-cover"
590,"FOUR, poor ball from bowler, short and wide of off, batsman gets on top of the bounce and cracks it behind square on the off-side. Beats backward point to his right and the man getting across in the deep"
591,"FOUR, this is a super quick outfield, flatter and on batsman's pads, nudged away behind square on the on-side. Two men gave chase, but the ball kept going away from their reach"
592,"FOUR, lovely shot, pushed through flatter and quicker, batsman shuffles down the track, makes room as he did so and drives it wide of mid-off, no need to run for those"
593,"FOUR, back-to-back boundaries for batsman, bowler drags his length back, drops it short and on batsman's pads, pulled away over square leg for another boundary"
594,"FOUR, 18 runs from the over, poor ball from bowler, fired it flatter and on batsman's pads, he goes back and clips it past square leg. The man in the ring was pretty square, gives the chase, but it's in vain"
595,"SIX, lovely shot, batsman is hurting team here, length delivery on the stumps, he presses forward and thumps it over mid-on, has enough power to pop over the fence on the full"
596,"SIX, back-to-back sixes, this is batsman's highest ever T20 score. bowler isn't learning here, another length delivery on the stumps, batsman backs away and lifts it high and over long-on, went a long way over the ropes at long-on"
597,"FOUR, cracking shot, awful start from bowler, fine leg was inside the ring and he looks to bounce out batsman. There's not much bounce on this one, batsman swivels across and helps it over short fine-leg, one bounce and over the ropes"
598,"out Caught by Axar!! batsman's fun is over, but has he taken this match away from team's grasp? This was banged in short and on the stumps, batsman swivels across and pulls it hard and flat - was struck pretty well but went straight into the hands of Axar at deep mid-wicket. He doesn't drop those and batsman walks off to a nice round of applause. Even his captain enjoyed it, gives a good send-off to his partner. batsman c Axar b bowler 37(18) [4s-4 6s-3]"
599,"FOUR, the short-ball attack isn't working and team aren't learning either. Banged in short and down the leg-side, batsman gets inside the line, swivels across and pulls it behind square on the on-side for a boundary"
600,"SIX, stylishly done, just a pick-up swivel from batsman and he sends it into the stands at wide long-on. Was quick to read the length, stayed on the front-foot and launched it into the stands"
601,"FOUR, deft touch from batsman, bowler dropped one short and wide of off, batsman makes room, waits on it, uses the pace on the ball and dabs it late, beats Sandeep at short third man and rolls away to the fence"
602,"FOUR, that's easy pickings for batsman, he's looking in good form tonight. Short and on the stumps, he gets inside the line and helps it on its way, one bounce and over the fence at backward square leg"
603,"FOUR, poor ball from bowler, dropped it short and wide of off, batsman makes room and cuts it behind square on the off-side. Miller was caught wrong-footed and has no chance to recover"
604,"FOUR, shoddy from Piyush Chawla, running around from fine leg. He's too stiff while bending and the ball slips underneath him. Swinging in on middle and leg, batsman clips it behind square leg and it shouldn't have been more than a couple"
605,"FOUR, the swing from bowler takes him on the pads once more, batsman stays in the crease and whips a glance down to the fine leg boundary. Brisk start from the Kings XI"
606,"SIX, that's been dispatched with disdain. Blistering pull shot. Short of length, around chest high, batsman is still on the front foot but he transfers his weight quickly and smashes it in front of square. Hits the boundary cushions on the full"
607,"out Caught by Gambhir!! Maiden IPL wicket for bowler. batsman's painful innings is over. The frustration was creeping in, he walked across and tried to nudge it into the on-side, it was an off-pace delivery and batsman was fooled there. Gets a fat leading edge that goes up in the air. The skipper takes a simple catch at cover and the crowd roars in delight. batsman c Gambhir b bowler 25(27) [4s-4]"
608,"out Caught by Uthappa!! Mad max Maxi is gone. This is a body blow for Punjab. Two wickets in two overs and the pendulum swings back in favour of team now. It was a pacy back of a length delivery, batsman backed away towards the leg-side, perhaps was undone by the bounce there. He is tucked up for room, ends up having a slash at it. Gets a feather and Uthappa makes no mistake behind the stumps. First time Maxi has been dismissed in this IPL. batsman c Uthappa b bowler 25(14) [4s-3 6s-1]"
609,"FOUR, flashed and flashed hard. Umesh provides width for batsman, he throws his bat and ekes out a thick outside edge that flies past first slip"
610,"FOUR, this is a bit streaky but batsman won't mind. Bangs it short, batsman went for the pull, gets a top-edge that flies over the keeper"
611,"no ball, SIX, thumpy thump! What a sin. bowler has overstepped again and one more free-hit for batsman. Hurls one full outside off, batsman plants his front foot across and smashes it flat and hard over extra cover. Such is the power that it carries all the way"
612,"SIX, batsman gets into the act. He's had enough. Uses his feet, reaches near the pitch and tonks it over long-off. An 84-meter strike"
613,"SIX, fabulous shot. He has picked this googly alright, shimmies out, meets the pitch and lofts it inside-out over extra cover. Sweet timing and it sails over the rope"
614,"FOUR, that is an awful effort from Narine. Makes a royal mess of this one. bowler wears a cheeky smile on his face. It was a short ball outside off, batsman gets a top-edge as he tried to elevate it over third man. The ball lobs in the air and drops in front of Narine at third man, he fails to get his body behind the line of the ball and lets it go through making him look absolute silly"
615,"SIX, that's gone a long way into the stands! batsman sets up a solid base on the leg-stump, lets his hands take over and smokes it miles into the deep square leg stands"
616,"FOUR, attempted yorker gone wrong for Umesh. Ends up offering a high full toss on off, batsman gets hit high on the willow but he manages it skew it past mid-off"
617,"out Caught by M Pandey!! There is a notion that full tosses are a bad ball but not on this occasion. Some respite for Umesh and team. Slips in a friendly full toss on the stumps, batsman went for a whack across the line, again squirts it high on the bat. Pops it high towards deep mid-wicket. Pandey ran forward, covered good ground and snaffled a good running catch. The umpires checked for a possible no-ball (both crease and height), but it was fine. team anthem blares in the background. batsman c M Pandey b bowler 28(19) [4s-2 6s-2]"
618,"out Caught by Woakes!! Two in two for Umesh. What an over this is turning out to be for team. Umesh is on hat-trick now. A fuller ball on off, batsman sort of checked his shot, ended up hitting it uppishly to mid-off, Woakes dived forward and held onto a smart catch. He ensured that it didn't pop out of his hands when his elbows hit the ground. batsman c Woakes b bowler 25(17) [4s-2 6s-2]"
619,"out Caught by Narine!! Three wickets in the over and Punjab are falling apart here. Umesh is on a roll. Spears it on a fuller length on off, straightened a wee bit. Patel was early into his shot, skims a leading edge that balloons straight into the hands of Narine at extra cover, who finally holds onto one today. batsman c Narine b bowler 0(1)"
620,"FOUR, he's timed that well. Gets on top of the bounce, opens the bat face nicely and steers it past point. No chance for the third man fielder"
621,"out Caught by Suryakumar Yadav!! Another one bites the dust. Against the run of play, Punjab lose another one. It was a short ball slanted at the body, Mohit went after it, gets it high on the bat and skews it to long-on where Suryakumar Yadav pouches it safely. batsman c Suryakumar Yadav b bowler 10(8) [4s-1]"
622,"FOUR, ravishing cover drive from batsman. This looks a belter of a pitch. This is no half-volley, but the ball is coming on so beautifully that batsman just leans across and caresses it on the up. Awesome timing"
623,"FOUR, third boundary today that bowler has conceded off the pads. Just straying a touch with the swing. Curling in on leg, batsman shuffles across and just tickles it through"
624,"1 run, Narine has shelled a sitter at third man. Oh dear. bowler just turns around in despair. A short of length delivery, batsman tries to pull off the front foot and sends a top-edge flying down to third man. They don't come easier than that"
625,"out Caught by Gambhir!! Oh goodness! Gambhir nearly made a meal of this catch. He somehow clasps onto it. A full ball outside off, batsman threw his bat, gets a top-edge that goes high in the air towards extra cover. Gambhir set himself under it, the ball was swirling in the air. The ball popped out of his hand, after juggling with it, he manages to gobble it up. batsman c Gambhir b bowler 4(5)"
626,"FOUR, deliberately goes up and over point. Ordinary delivery. Short of length with width on offer, batsman opens his wrists up as he slashes it away to lift it over the infield"
627,"FOUR, the boundaries keep coming as the bowlers keep erring in line. Full ball on the pads, fine leg is inside the ring, so batsman effortlessly whips it over him and into the fence. team off to a flying start"
628,"FOUR, that's a risky shot but batsman backs himself to ramp a short of length delivery into the third man boundary. He got it fine enough of the fielder. One bounce and over the ropes"
629,"5 wides, an inswinger from bowler. But this one goes a long way in the air, falls away down the leg-side and beats Uthappa completely. There's no stopping those runs"
630,"out Bowled!! Much needed breakthrough for the hosts. bowler comes on and strikes first ball. Not a big turner of the ball, this bloke, and that skiddiness through the surface accounts for batsman. May have been the googly. Pushed through the air, lands it on a length, and the ball zips through the gate as batsman tries to loft it on the up. He was aiming for the inside-out shot with the turn. But the ball goes straight on and knocks over middle and off. batsman b bowler 28(19) [4s-4 6s-1]"
631,"FOUR, only slightly short, the ball slides in on leg, and batsman is quick to go back in the crease. He effortlessly whips a pull over square leg and beats long leg to his left"
632,"1 run, fires them in, 103kph, batsman punches it to the right of point and quickly goes through to the other end"
633,"out Bowled!! Chopped on! batsman doesn't pick this one. He expects the ball to go away to aid his cut shot, but it turns in slightly to cramp him up. A thick under-edge into the pitch before bouncing up to knock over the top of leg stump. batsman b bowler 9(12) [4s-1]"
634,"FOUR, picked off his hips for six, is it? No, one bounce. So stylishly done. Loose from bowler again, he bowls back of a length and bowls leg-stump. batsman languidly swivels outside the line and helps it on its way. Lovely wrists"
635,"1 run, dropped by Uthappa! Definitely two noises there. Back of length, cutting in and takes the inside edge. The ball deflects off batsman's thigh as well. Uthappa dives to his left with one hand but the ball hits him hard on the glove"
636,"FOUR, short of length into the body, batsman wallops a pull through backward square leg. That's rocketed to the fence. Really poor from bowler. He's been consistently short so far"
637,"SIX, he's in some form in this tournament. A flighted leg-break from bowler, it's right in the slot. batsman is close enough to the pitch, knows that bowler doesn't turn it a great deal and just swings through the line over long-on"
638,"FOUR, four more. Flatter outside off but it's full again, and batsman smokes a flat-batted drive wide of long-off"
639,"FOUR, bowler under serious pressure. This is scintillating batting. He goes wide of off again, and is carted over extra-cover again. An unabridged swing of the bat"
640,"out Caught by Gayle!! bowler tears off the wrapping paper and presents team with a gift in his first over. Early strike from the home team. bowler was being under used in the last three matches. Makes amends immediately today with a prized scalp of batsman. It was a fuller length delivery jagging in on leg-stump line, seemed to have stopped on batsman. He flicks it meekly straight to mid-wicket. Gayle won't drop those. batsman c Gayle b bowler 2(5)"
641,"SIX, in the slot and Pandya connects one. Scooches low and smacks one over long-off"
642,"FOUR, in the blockhole, the ball chirps the toe-end of the bat and bisects the gap between the keeper and the slip fielder to race away to the fence. That was really full and was just outside off to force the batsman to jam his bat down on that"
643,"FOUR, length ball outside off and the batsman flogs the ball away with the meaty bottom-hand coming into play. The gap between long-on and deep mid-wicket was easily pierced"
644,"SIX, backs away and clears the man at deep extra cover. He went inside out and got enough meat on it to send it packing over the cover fielder's head. Any doubts on batsman's powerful delivering skills were quelled down. He didn't time it at all. The batter got it off the outer part of the bat and still enough sinew in it to send it over the ropes"
645,"FOUR, fifty for the combo! He waited on that slower delivery and then dismissed it out of his sight with disdain. Got the room as well to free his arms and then got the ball speeding between cover and mid-off for a four"
646,"FOUR, full ball targetting the sticks and the batsman got enough wood on it to clip it away. The man from deep square who was Binny came running in to make the save but despite getting a hand on it, couldn't bend down enough to stop that. Second four of the over"
647,"SIX, flat hit! That was a flatter delivery and the batsman spanks it down the ground and over the bowler's head to give himself a wonderful fifty! This has been a top-class knock from the Trinidadian"
648,"SIX, go fetch that! That has gone out of this orbit. That was flat again from bowler and the batsman shot a firecracker into the night sky to the delight of the team fans"
649,"FOUR, poor from Mills! That was dabbed away with soft hands and the fielder at short third man does the London Bridge and dives over it to open the floodgates for team. The momentum has again changed hands"
650,"SIX, succeeds this time! He reaches out for the dragged slog and then biffs the ball down the ground to send it rocketing 20 rows into the stands"
651,"out Caught by de Villiers!! The gamble has worked for Kohli. Gives the ball to bowler, who tosses it up, the batsman takes the aerial route but gets more elevation than distance and ends up being caught at long-off. That again went very high but ABD was all calm under the ball and cupped it without any fuss. batsman c de Villiers b bowler 70(47) [4s-3 6s-5]"
652,"FOUR, short ball, pulled away and no man in the deep mid-wicket region allows the ball to race away into the fence. Chahal from deep square ran across and the ball sandwiches between him and the ground to ensure that he is in some pain. Hope he is OK as he has a grimacing expression on his face"
653,"SIX, slower delivery, batsman picks that up and dismantles the ball over the cow corner region for a maximum. That is it. team have got themselves out of jail here after self-imprisoning themselves with a dreadful start. They were 7 for 4 but Pollard-Pandya have done it for them. 3rd win for team!"
654,"out Caught by Gayle!! Two in two for team. Chinnaswamy breaks the sound barrier. team are right back in this contest. Both openers back in the hut now. bowler looped it full outside off, it was the sucker ball and Patel fell into the trap. Drove it on the rise straight to Gayle at short extra cover. The West Indian shows quick reflexes as he pouches an excellent catch. He was alert enough and his natural instincts took over there. batsman c Gayle b bowler 3(8)"
655,"out Caught by Mandeep!! ""Mumbai Indians are committing hara-kiri"" screams Ravi Shaz on air. Can't disagree. batsman has been promoted up the order and what does he do first ball? Gets underneath a full toss and smacks it straight into the bucket hands of Mandeep at long-on. batsman c Mandeep b bowler 0(1)"
656,"out Bowled!! The scoreline reads 7/4. This is surreal from team. What an over from bowler. bowler takes a hat-trick. batsman's woeful form continues. He fails to pick this googly from bowler. The crowd go bonkers. It came back in as batsman prodded forward to defend, leaves a gap between his bat-pad. Enough for the ball to sneak through to rattle the stumps. batsman b bowler 0(2)"
657,"FOUR, Rana is the man in form. Poor ball from Mills, slides one down leg, Rana gets across and whips it crisply behind square. No chance for the fine leg fielder"
658,"SIX, greets him to the crease with a maximum. Tosses it up, a floppy-hat batsman plants his front foot forward and launches it over long-off. A blow so meaty that it deserved some extra cheese and french fries to add to it"
659,"out Caught by Aravind!! What a dream spell from bowler. Finishes it with a wicket. His fourth of the evening. Rana bites the dirt. Was itching to smack this quicker delivery, it was wider of off. The width was there and Rana went after it with a flashy cut. He forgets to keep it down and hits it straight to point. Aravind dives forward and takes a fine low catch. team sink further into the mire. batsman c Aravind b bowler 11(16) [4s-1]"
660,"1 run, dropped! Buttler went backwards at deep-midwicket, then circled under it and drops it in the end. That was a mistimed slog-sweep and the ball stayed in the sky for a long long time. Buttler messed it up by never really judging it"
661,"byes, FOUR, byes signalled! The ball kept terribly low as batsman backed away to thwack it. The ball rolled down to beat the keeper through his legs and run away into the fence. Bumrah giving it a chase comes up with a comical effort - tried to flick it back and ended up lobbing the ball outside the boundary edge"
662,"SIX, that's a six and a half! That ball is gone into the sea of reds in the cow corner region. That was a slower delivery and batsman spotted it like dead meat after giving the charge and picked the bones out of that"
663,"SIX, full toss and the ball has been banged down the ground! Over the man at long-off and fifty for the skipper in his comeback game! He can do no wrong in this league. That was effortlessly done"
664,"FOUR, cheeky from the skipper as he opens the face of the blade and runs it past the diving keeper for a four"
665,"FOUR, looks to slog sweep, the ball chalks the outer thin edge and runs past the keeper for a four. Lucky and streaky"
666,"out Caught by Buttler!! The Buttler serves this one up for his team by pouching the big man on the juggle. That was wide and on a length, the batsman threw his hands at that and managed to trample it straight down the throat of the man at deep cover. Buttler came in a few paces, juggled it once as the ball came at chest height to him and then on the juggle managed to grab hold of it. batsman c Buttler b bowler 62(47) [4s-5 6s-2]"
667,out Caught by Rohit!! The Hit Man does it for the team side. He flies to his left and flings his left hand to pick that out of thin air. That was chipped away uppishly sans any control from ABD and the ball was picked up inches from the ground as Rohit decided to showcase his wings at extra cover. Third time Krunal has accounted for ABD in the IPL. batsman c Rohit b bowler 19(21) [6s-1]
668,"out Kedar Jadhav Run Out!! The yorker blocked back, the bowler picks it up with one hand to his left and then has the mind to strike the sticks down at the bowler's end. That was harakiri from Kedar Jadhav as he was backing up so far on a free-hit delivery. That will hurt team but credit to bowler as he had the brain to take the opportunity. Kedar Jadhav run out (bowler) 9(8)"
669,"out Bowled!! Gone first ball. The length ball, batsman looks to go for the big monty and ends up dragging the ball onto his sticks. He had to throw caution to the winds but manages only a thick inside edge. bowler is finally getting amongst the wickets in this season after a disastrous start to his campaign. batsman b bowler 0(1)"
670,"SIX, first maximum for batsman. Finds his bearing right this time. Sees a full ball on off, just stands motionless, in fact took a step forward and thumps it over long-on. Doesn't bother to look at the ball at all. He knows it went a long way"
671,"FOUR, awful start this has been for bowler. Overbakes and bangs it short, sits up nicely for batsman, who skips back and muscles the pull in front of square on the on-side"
672,"FOUR, two fours in a row. ""He is looking ominous here,"" says Ravi Shaz on air. This was a half-volley on fifth stump line, batsman brings those quicksilver wrists of his into play. Just gets inside the line and whips it past mid-on. Goes to the fence like a 'famous bullet phrase' to the fence"
673,"FOUR, the chat has worked. Virat offered some advice to batsman and next ball the big man slaps one to the fence. A quicker delivery outside off, batsman goes back and flays the cut, through point. Zooms away to the fence."
674,"FOUR, stand and deliver stuff from batsman. Just flexes his arms and times the pants off this length ball. Races away through cover and no need to run for those"
675,"SIX, batsman flies out of the blocks! He runs out of patience and shows Michael Jackson footwork. Reaches the pitch this time and lifts it high up in the air. Didn't get it off the middle but enough to clear the man at long-on"
676,"FOUR, buffet ball, as Geoff Boycott would say. Short and offers enough width, batsman skips back and knives with a solid punch, the timing was brutal and it beats extra cover"
677,"out Caught by Parthiv Patel!! Gone! Pandya has struck in his first over. As often is the case, lapse in concentration for batsman. Hits the deck on a shortish length outside off, batsman wanted to pull it, he had to fetch it from outside off. He came down a step and wanted to smack the leather off it. All he could do was manifest a faint nick to the keeper. PP went up straightaway and Hardik joined him late. Hushed silence in the crowd. The umpires checked for a possible no-ball but his foot was way behind the crease. batsman c Parthiv Patel b bowler 22(27) [4s-2 6s-1]"
678,"FOUR, that's a thick inside edge is what it is. Smith just plants his foot down looking to loft it down the ground without being anywhere close to the pitch. It slides in, spoons up off the edge and beats square leg before running away"
679,"SIX, he's got proper hold of that. Good lord. That's gone way back. Not much different than the first delivery as Smith lunges at a length ball but this time he muscles it right off the middle. Welcome back as an opener"
680,"FOUR, now Ankit fires it short and Smith goes back to punch it through the covers. What a blistering start for team! 16 off the over"
681,"SIX, bangs it in short but it's a leg-cutter and it just sits up. McCullum makes room and spanks a flat-batted shot over extra-cover. Woof!"
682,"out Stumped!! The junior Chahar continues to impress. Some of the fantasy fanatics are cursing_____ you know who! Baz follows his instincts, shimmies down and looks to bash the young man over long-on. Was nowhere near the pitch of the delivery, beaten by length and done in the drift and dip. MS slaps the bails in flash. batsman st Dhoni b bowler 49(32) [4s-5 6s-3]"
683,"out Bowled!! bowler strikes and the customary celebrations follow! DK had a great domestic season, looked decent thus far in this IPL, but not today. He was shaping up to cut, perhaps didn't expect Imran bowler to fire in a googly. Result? He ends up chopping it back onto his stumps, off the inside edge obviously. batsman b bowler 3(5)"
684,"FOUR, paddle-scoops a leg-drifter to the fine leg fence, good placement"
685,"SIX, this is batsman at his best. He does this so often against spinners. Dances down, gets to the pitch of the delivery and takes bowler for a journey over cow corner"
686,"FOUR, first poor delivery from bowler. Half-volley outside off, batsman lofts him inside-out over extra cover. Smith running in from long-off gave up a little too early"
687,"FOUR, that's timed to perfection! Save your legs. It rose just enough from a fullish length, batsman shows the full face of the bat as he spanks it through cover. No chance for the man in the deep"
688,"FOUR, plenty of flight on that one and batsman takes full toll of it. Watches it closely and nails the drive wide of extra cover"
689,"FOUR, batsman is having a ball out there. Middling almost everything. On one knee, gets underneath a flighted delivery and loft-drives bowler over extra cover"
690,"FOUR, on the pads, batsman says thank you and brooms him away into the deep backward square fence. 13 off the over"
691,"FOUR, a night to forget for Imran Tahir as he puts one down. Pick-up flick shot from batsman, Tahir at fine leg was late to anticipate as he tries to reach the ball with a lackadaisical dive, through his fingers"
692,"SIX, that's a batsman special. He loves pace, doesn't he? Stamps a 145ks delivery with a 80-metre maximum over square leg. Pure power!"
693,"SIX, that's it. Gujarat Lions win their first game of the season. batsman goes deep inside the crease, expects pace and envelops it over long-on"
694,"FOUR, bludgeoned! A short of length delivery outside off which Smith smokes through mid-wicket. To hit that well in front of square against someone like Ferguson, especially after having to fetch it from wide of off, it's a special shot"
695,"FOUR, you don't bowl short to this guy, not unless you're express. Such fast hands as he dispatches a pull through mid-wicket. The man in the deep is too square"
696,"no run, hit straight back at Thakur who puts it down. Half a chance here. McCullum had timed that beautifully and the ball was travelling. But it came at a nice height in the followthrough. Thakur parries it towards mid-off"
697,"FOUR, 147kph on that length ball and Smith uses all of it to slice the ball over backward point. Or maybe I'm giving him too much credit and it's just a thick outside edge. In either case, he went hard and the ball flew"
698,"FOUR, a proper half-volley at the stumps, beautifully whipped away wide of mid-on. Excellent wrists from Smith. team off to a flier"
699,"FOUR, lunges out at the ball and lofts it over mid-off. Interesting that he's gone after bowler first ball. The ball was full enough to execute the shot and he took his opportunity"
700,"FOUR, now McCullum skips out of the crease, takes it on the full and drills it through extra-cover. Back to back boundaries"
701,"SIX, a little shimmy down the track, reaches out to the pitch of the ball and wallops it over long-on. bowler under pressure, probably for the first time in this IPL"
702,"FOUR, too close to cut, but Smith has played it well! Picked the length early, rocked back and slapped it from around off-stump backwards of point"
703,"FOUR, that's pleading to be pummeled. Short and slides down, Smith with a brazen-looking pull shot puts it away into the vacant mid-wicket area"
704,"FOUR, kneels down and sweeps bowler between long-on and deep mid-wicket. Gee! This is some exhibition"
705,"FOUR, a repeat of the previous delivery. This time though he had to fetch it from well outside off and beats Stokes's dive to his right at long-on"
706,"SIX, skips out of his crease and smokes a dart high into the night sky, straight back over the bowler's head"
707,"FOUR, full floater on middle and leg, Smith drills it to the right of a diving Imran bowler. Long-on can't get there"
708,"out Caught by Rahul Chahar!! Flays one straight down the throat of third man. batsman is disappointed, but he has done his job. Was lured by the width on offer and went chasing, makes a mess of the connection though, it slices the thick outside edge and drops as a dolly into the hands of junior Chahar. batsman c Rahul Chahar b bowler 47(30) [4s-8 6s-1]"
709,"out Caught by Raina!! What a way to start your 150th IPL game. First, won the toss and now pulls off a blinder. Even he can't believe that he has plucked that out. A blob for batsman and early trouble for Pune. This one jagged back in from a shortish length, batsman thought it would be shaping away and went for a flashy cut, the outside edge flies towards the cordon. Raina, standing at wide slip, reacts quickly and grabs it with his left hand. He caught it when the ball had almost passed him. batsman c Raina b bowler 0(3)"
710,"FOUR, class written all over it. Tells us what kind of form batsman is in. Ball is darting around and he just presents the full face of the bat and drives it straight past the bowler, the timing and placement was exquisite from the skipper"
711,"FOUR, batsman is off the mark with a fine shot. Thampi wanted to start with a yorker, misses it by a good distance, the full toss is thumped down the ground, past the diving mid-on fielder"
712,"FOUR, edged and four. batsman won't mind that. Quicker and the ball straightens a touch, batsman goes hard on the drive and the outside edge runs away fine. A welcome boundary for team"
713,"FOUR, hit-me delivery from Smith. Short and down leg, batsman swivels and helps it over the short fine leg fielder. He's keeping the scoreboard moving swiftly"
714,"out Bowled!! The aeroplane takes off. Second wicket for Tye and what a selection he's been for team. Another biggie for the home side. A set Ben batsman departs. It was the knuckle ball from Tye, batsman did not pick it and was early into his drive, the ball catches the inside edge and deflects off the pads onto the stumps. team in a spot of bother now. batsman b bowler 25(18) [4s-2 6s-1]"
715,"FOUR, that's a half-tracker wide of off. Tiwary fetches it and shovels it wide of long-on. Jakati under pressure straightaway after an ordinary first over"
716,out Lbw!! batsman's poor run of form continues. He's hit on the back leg as bowler slides one on with the arm and the ball would have clipped leg-stump at least. batsman wanted to cut loose here and unwinds a hefty swing looking to go downtown but was beaten on the inside edge by the slider. A good phase for Gujarat this. batsman lbw b bowler 5(8)
717,"FOUR, nicely done. He's played this so late and so delicately, using all the pace that bowler has to offer. Darted in on a back of a length just outside off, Ankit leans back and dabs it fine of short third man"
718,"FOUR, brilliant timing. The ball races away past point. Back of a length outside off, Tiwary eases onto the back foot and punches it firmly. Good start to the over"
719,"2 runs, back of a length slower ball on middle and leg, Ankit makes room and chops it into the pitch. He's ambling across for a single as Thampi appeared to be lazy in getting to the ball, but that's only a smokescreen. Thampi quickly pounces, turns and throws and would have caught Ankit short had he hit the stumps direct. Instead, concedes an extra run"
720,"1 run, hammered back at the bowler and that's not really a chance. Props to bowler for getting his hands in position quick enough and attempt a catch but he can't hold on. It was hit powerfully. Saved a boundary really"
721,"FOUR, this time bowler can do nothing about it. Full in the slot, Ankit drills it straight down the ground and beats long-on to the right"
722,"SIX, goes down on one knee and tonks the ball straight back down the ground. Finishes a good over for team. 14 off it. bowler fires it full again, maybe aiming for the blockhole, but misses it by a fair distance and Tiwary is all over him"
723,"SIX, length and into the batsman, right in Ankit's arc to heave it over cow corner. It might have been a slower ball but Ankit picked it all right"
724,"out Caught by Brendon McCullum!! That's been skied up .. and McCullum takes a really good catch around 5 yards inside the ropes. It was there to be slogged from a length, but Ankit went through it too early and lobbed a leading edge up which surprisingly travelled quite a fair bit. McCullum skirts to his right from long-on, runs backwards and grabs it with both hands while tumbling over. batsman c Brendon McCullum b bowler 25(15) [4s-2 6s-1]"
725,"out Caught by Ishan Kishan!! Two in two. Tye has four. Slower ball at the stumps, Tiwary swings it in the air and is caught at the backward square leg boundary. Lovely deception from Tye. batsman c Ishan Kishan b bowler 31(27) [4s-2 6s-1]"
726,out Bowled!! Two hat-tricks in a day. The IPL has gone mental. Thakur has absolutely no clue as Tye dips a knuckle ball into the blockhole and he ends up playing all around it. The ball sneaks through to knock leg-stump. Tye is absolutely pumped. It's a five-for as well! batsman b bowler 0(1)
727,"FOUR, wow! Does this man have wrists? Even the sub-continent players will be proud of this shot. Full delivery around off, batsman with his slight shuffle brings those wrists into play as he flicks it over mid-wicket. Couple of bounces and into the fence"
728,"FOUR, lovely shot! Nothing too fancy from batsman. Waited for the ball to do its bit - move away and used the width on offer to his advantage, carved it past the diving cover-point fielder and it raced across the turf"
729,"2 runs, that could have, and should have, been four in the over for Tye. Another knuckle ball, Chahar is early into the slog and miscues it to Jadeja of all people at deep mid-wicket. He puts down a simple enough chance"
730,"FOUR, greets Jakati with a whippy flick. Flatter and just outside off, batsman brings his bat down at an angle and whips it past mid-on. No chance for the deep mid-wicket fielder"
731,"SIX, glorious. Uses his feet and gets right to the pitch of the flighted delivery, once he did that the rest was easy, lofts it handsomely over the long-on fence for the first six of the game"
732,"SIX, well, batsman showing why he's been sent out to open. One, two and bang. Advances to the length delivery and swings through the line. Hit flat and over deep mid-wicket"
733,"SIX, the result though does not change. Good length ball around off, batsman lofts through the line, nice free flowing of the bat and off it went over the long-off fence. Back-to-back sixes for batsman"
734,"FOUR, the 50-run partnership is up. Rahane's wicket seems a long time ago. Pitched up and right in the slot, batsman has no half measures in his armoury, lofts it over the infield on the off-side and collects four more"
735,FOUR.. and it is usual business from batsman at the other end. Sees the delivery in his arc and lofts it straight back over the bowler's head. Once again the full face of the bat was the key to the shot
736,"FOUR, poor bowling this from PK. Searches for the yorker, low full toss down leg, batsman just helps it along the way, flicked behind square and there's no one in the deep to stop that. Expensive over from PK, 25 off it and team are off to a flier"
737,"out Caught by Finch!! A breezy innings comes to an end. One shot too many from batsman. Should have tried to bat a bit longer, especially with Smith at the other end. Full delivery on off, batsman makes a bit of room and lofts it to mid-off. The idea was to go over the fielder, but with the ball being too close to his bat, he did not get the elevation. Finch reverse cups it right on the edge of the circle. batsman c Finch b bowler 33(17) [4s-3 6s-2]"
738,"FOUR, errs in line and batsman is too good a player to miss out. Drifts onto the pads, batsman stays on leg-stump and glances it fine. PK at short fine dives just to please the captain, the ball had gone past him"
739,"SIX, just a pick up shot and cleared the rope by quite some distance. Bit of air on this delivery, batsman uses his long reach to get under that and sends it sailing over deep mid-wicket. Jaddu under the pump"
740,"out Caught by Finch!! Break followed by a wicket. The bowling change has worked for team. This is a huge wicket. batsman was looking in ominous touch. Short of length delivery just outside off, batsman went for the pull and top edged it towards long-off. Finch had plenty of time to settle under that and he pouches it safely. Just what team needed after the time-out and not what team required. Steven batsman was gutted with himself, smacks the bat onto his glove as he walks back. batsman c Finch b bowler 43(28) [4s-6 6s-1]"
741,"FOUR, stands tall in his crease and rockets the flat-bat smack back over the bowler, wasn't in complete control, but it had enough power to go all the way"
742,"SIX, a nice way to nail your form back. And he exhibits it with some toying around. Just crouches, takes on the line off a length sliding in and swats it flat batted. Such is the timing that it flies all the way too"
743,"FOUR, too much of a risk. But when the luck flows for you, you'd better be milking it. And batsman does it with aplomb. Sinks and without quite picking the wrong 'un slogs it hard and high. Through the hands of a diving Dhawan at the mid-wicket fence"
744,"FOUR, leans forward, takes on the short pepper head-on and mows it across the line. Not the timing but once again the placement in finding the gap to bounce it into the cow corner fence"
745,"FOUR, now he's back to his caresses. More like the batsman we know. Moves away, exposes his stumps and bowler tries his best to evade the reach with a wide yorker. Gets under it and shows the full bat face in lofting it over extra cover"
746,"FOUR, make it 14 off the over. A length angler with the width pounced on by a backing away Pandey as he imparts all the timing in spanking his punch through the covers."
747,"FOUR, irritating runs these. batsman's edges are back to deal. Rashid gets some extra bounce on his top-spinner but all that comes in handy with batsman looking to sit and slog. The top-edge runs past the keeper"
748,"out Caught by Rashid Khan!! The luck runs out. But it's done the damage. On the shorter side, with the pace taken off the ball as well. batsman looks to go ahead with his front-footed pulls but wears it high on the bat with the face swaying upwards as well. For a change, the airy ride finds its destination in the hands of Rashid at mid-wicket. batsman c Rashid Khan b bowler 68(39) [4s-5 6s-4]"
749,"FOUR, goes full pace. Only to watch the edge bag a boundary against his name. On the back of a length and outside off as well tempting Pandey to go after it. He flashes hard and the outside tickle takes it through the cordon where no one is"
750,"SIX, the feet are on the skipping mode. Sharma does the cardinal sin of darting it in Pandey's arc and the shimmy down with the full bat swing unleashed tonks it high and mighty"
751,"FOUR, a tossed up invite. And Pathan cannot refuse. With a massive stride in getting right up to the pitch of the delivery, he nails the broom. Whistles away in front of square"
752,"SIX, a yorker missed by the slightest of margins. And Pandey punishes it to the fullest. Gets moving inwards, gets right under what ended up as a half volley and smashes it down the ground"
753,"FOUR, cheeky now. bowler persists with his yorkers. gets it right too this time. And wide as well to prevent the earlier misery. Pandey however has his bat ramped up with a crouch and guides it using all the pace on offer. Wide of backward point"
754,out Caught by Warner!! A strike. In the form of bowler. A slower float here outside off and Pandey pretty compulsively reaches out in looking to deposit it out of the park. Is quite early on his slice and the balloon off the cue end goes high but just not long enough. A running in Warner from long-off will not put these down. Not even if he is distracted by Bipul Sharma running back from cover to take it. batsman c Warner b bowler 46(35) [4s-3 6s-2]
755,"FOUR, misses the blockhole. Just the shot Yadav needed to help himself to his first runs. A low full toss on the pads and whipped away with those enviable wrists. The deep square boundary takes the impact"
756,"out Caught by Naman Ojha!! The umpire spots an edge. And is happy to raise the finger. Sorry, not quite the time to be mean. bowler bends his back in banging it short, and cramps Yadav all ends up for any room. Despite the shuffle coming in, the swivelling pull only gets the ping on the glove to a diving Ojha to his left. batsman c Naman Ojha b bowler 4(3) [4s-1]"
757,"SIX, spoiling his figures. A perfect sitting up length delivery right in the slot and Pathan is in his beast mode unleashing the entire bat curve bringing it down off a massive backlift and spanks it high and mighty"
758,out Bowled!! A mess of the stumps. The pin-point yorker comes out at full pace and Grandhomme without bothering to move his feet just jams his bat down. No connection at all. The off-pole is uprooted. Kolkata just not getting the move-on they'd aspired. batsman b bowler 0(2)
759,"out Bowled!! The off-stump goes flying. Bhuvi has had a fantastic bowling record over team and it only gets better. It swings in the air, lands on the seam and shapes just enough to uproot batsman's off-pole. The slash-flash batsman had no clue about that one. By the time the ball dipped in, batsman opened himself up completely and embarassed himself. batsman b bowler 6(9) [4s-1]"
760,"FOUR, plenty of room on offer and batsman has nailed the cover-drive to perfection, pierced the gap between cover and extra-cover"
761,"FOUR, drifting into the pads, batsman shuffles a fraction before helping it to the fine leg fence. Easy!"
762,"FOUR, stands deep inside his crease and exerts all his power on the punchy-drive, gets it past a diving mid-off to his right"
763,"SIX, gets underneath this one and lauches it over long-on, picked the length early and was helped with some width on offer"
764,"1 run, flicks to square leg and rushes for a non-existent single. Dhawan aims at the bowler's end and misses, had that hit batsman was a goner. He is living dangerously here"
765,"out Bowled!! Got him! bowler does it again, he has taken wicket off the first over in every game he played. That's some record. batsman exposes all his stumps looking to cut it square, the quicker one skids on and pings the bails in a flash. batsman slaps his bat onto his pad as he walks back in disgust. batsman b bowler 15(16) [4s-2]"
766,"SIX, stand and deliver! Uses those Popeye-esque arms to smash a pull off the front foot, sheer power! It has gone flying into the mid-wicket stands"
767,"SIX, sits back and smites a half-tracker over wide long-on, he is making the most of his luck today"
768,"FOUR, width on offer outside off. batsman chases it with a slash and gets a fat outside edge. The ball flies past the slip fielder and races away past the ropes. Hits the laptop in the team dugout. Probably, the one that of the statsman"
769,"FOUR, delicacy from batsman! It was a off-cutter which sat up on the pitch, he uses the width and sends it open-bat faced into the vacant third man region"
770,"out Caught&Bowled!! Things looking bleak for team. 3 of their main batsmen are back in the hut now. No change of pace this time around, he spears it in at 136ks on a good length, batsman checks his drive and chips it back to the bowler. Easily done. He was perhaps expecting the slower one. It came right off the cue end of the bat. batsman c and b bowler 13(10) [4s-2]"
771,"FOUR, stands tall on his back foot and delivers a perfect pull does Yuvi, picked the right spot to place it too. No-one at deep mid-wicket, one bounce and over the ropes"
772,"SIX, advances, gets right to the pitch of the delivery and hacks him over wide long-on. Nailed!"
773,"SIX, I hate to do commentary on balls like these. Coz, all you want to do is stand, admire and applaud the class of Yuvi. Wowza! Holds the pose for the cameras as he powers a mere extension of the arms on this 141ks pace cranker"
774,"FOUR, effortlessly done. Short and down leg, he half-swivels and puts it over short fine with a twirl of his wrists"
775,"FOUR, backs away to manufacture the desired room, cuts the length ball in the gap behind point. Smart cricket"
776,"out Stumped!! Nah, not again! Looks to fancy his chances against the wily bowler. Not to the pitch and was caught miles short. 83ks, lands on the seam and moves the other way round and beats batsman neck and crop. Uthappa does the rest. He was looking to go over long-on/mid-wicket. Booming bat swing, but no dice. batsman st Uthappa b bowler 13(7) [4s-1 6s-1]"
777,"SIX. That's dismissive. Precise, mathematic middle of the bat. No feet, allows his wrists to take over. The gift of timing. Flat-footed, takes on the short and wide ball, thumps it flat over extra cover. Fetch that!"
778,"FOUR, batsman likes the short stuff, he likes pace too. No wonder he's from Brisbane. Rocks a touch back and then smashes the pull through mid-wicket, raced away..."
779,"out Caught by (sub)Rishi Dhawan!! And look what that extra delivery has done, it has fetched team the much-needed wicket. Yuvi walks back disappointed and has been asked to wait by the umpires. Oh hang on! What's the wait for? Just a little confusion out there and Yuvi continues his march. It was a slower short ball, Yuvi was through the shot way too early, didn't get hold of the pull and holes out to long-on. Good running catch from the sub fielder. batsman c (sub)Rishi Dhawan b bowler 26(16) [4s-2 6s-2]"
780,"SIX, that's in his half and batsman has clubbed that straight back over the bowler. Clears his front leg, gets underneath and goes bam!"
781,"out Caught by de Grandhomme!! The Kiwi combination does the trick. The ever-smiling bowler can smile a little more now. batsman shuffles a long way across his stumps, premeditates the slog straight down the ground and makes a mess of the connection. Outcome? He tumbles after the half-hearted execution and it goes flat and straight to the man at long-off. batsman c de Grandhomme b bowler 15(10) [4s-1 6s-1]"
782,"SIX, quick-feeted this time, does just enough to pick the length and marmalize it over team's dugout at the long-off area"
783,"FOUR, takes his eyes off and pulls a short ball. Top-edge flies over the keeper's head, all these runs count"
784,"FOUR, full and angled in, Bipul stays leg-side of the delivery and biffs it straight, long-on and long-off can't cut it off. Too good"
785,"1 run, catch it is the cry, but Woakes can't hold onto it. That came in at a rapid pace. Once again, batsman gives the charge and this time he slashes it off the middle of the bat. The Englishman at cover-point dived to his right and half-stopped it. Saved three runs there"
786,"FOUR, stand and deliver. batsman stays in his crease, sees the shortish ball come to him and lifts it over mid-on. He stood there and admired his shot"
787,"FOUR, not off the middle , but batsman won't mind. A length ball on middle and leg, batsman moves across and swishes it away. Finds the gap on the on-side and the ball races away into the mid-wicket fence"
788,"FOUR, that's not the greatest of deliveries from bowler! Short ball that sits up nicely for batsman to pull it firmly behind square on the on-side"
789,"FOUR, first boundary for batsman! That was a good ball from bowler. He bowled a sharp bouncer attacking the head of the batsman. batsman, who almost took his eye off it, wasn't afraid to go with his hook shot. Came right off the middle of the middle in the end. One bounce into the fence"
790,"FOUR, four more! bowler pitches it up this time. batsman presses forward and checks his drive. The ball falls wide and short of GG at covers and the ball rolls into the extra cover fence"
791,"FOUR, easy to put away. Drifting down leg, all batsman had to do was get a tickle, which he did. No chance for the man at 45 to stop that"
792,"FOUR, shot! Typical batsman! Reverses his stance and wallops the sweep over backward point. With both the deep fielders on the on-side, that's an excellent shot"
793,"out Caught by de Grandhomme!! That's a soft dismissal. The ploy of giving Pathan the ball has worked. That ball didn't deserve a wicket to be honest. It was floated outside off, batsman waltzes down, moving slightly leg-side and chips it towards de Grandhomme at long-off, who runs forward and pouches it. There was no intent there from the southpaw there. batsman c de Grandhomme b bowler 23(22) [4s-4]"
794,"FOUR, tossed up delivery outside off, not much of spin there and batsman latches onto it. He smacks the cut behind square on the off-side. The sweeper can't get there"
795,out Caught by Woakes!! This was coming. batsman was struggling against the spinners and perishes trying to play the big shot. A tossed up delivery that pitched outside off and turned further away. batsman got low and wanted to clear long-off. Doesn't get enough power behind it and a straightforward catch from Woakes at long-off. Lots of revs on that delivery. batsman c Woakes b bowler 26(30) [4s-4]
796,"FOUR, no, no. Wrong line Sandeep, searches for that banana swing. In the process, sprays it on the pads, the fine leg was inside the ring and easy put away for batsman. Just nurdles it past the man at 45"
797,"FOUR, candyfloss. Cracking shot from batsman. Leans forward and caresses it through the packed off-side field. Eventful start for DD"
798,"FOUR, not where he exactly intended but he will earn a boundary. batsman gets off the mark with a boundary. Mohit bangs it short, batsman was committed to the pull, was hustled by pace, manages to get it off the higher part of his bat and skews it over mid-on"
799,"FOUR, make that two in a row. Mohit goes shorter again, batsman is bred on English soil. Too easy for him, pulls it wide of mid-on. No need to run for those"
800,"FOUR, with mid-wicket inside the ring, the pull is a safe shot. That is if you get it right. batsman was almost cramped for room, but got the pull high on the bat and placed it to the left of mid-wicket. No chance for long-on to cut it off"
801,"out Caught by Eoin Morgan!! Catching practice for Morgan. Another partnership that had started to flourish is nipped in the bud. Not the greatest of shots from Iyer. It was a length delivery alright and he wanted to loft it over the long-on fence, the bat turned on impact and the ball went up towards long-on. Second catch for the England ODI skipper. batsman c Eoin Morgan b bowler 22(17) [4s-3]"
802,"1 run, fifty for batsman. Raises his bat and acknowledges the applause from the home crowd. Still a long way to go for him. The pitch has started to get slower and run making is not going to be easy. With him being set, DD would want him to carry on. Coming to the ball: Plays the slower delivery with soft hands into the off-side ring and jogs across to the other end"
803,"FOUR, bowler almost deceived his man. Saw the batsman advance and pushed it wider, batsman reached out and lofted it inside out, not off the meat of the bat but had enough to collect a boundary"
804,"out Caught by Miller!! The small little things that you do produce the bigger things. That Vohra stop kept batsman on strike and what happens next? The Kent man miscues a loft to long-on. Takes a couple of steps down, not close to the ball but still goes through with the loft. Right off the toe-end and almost had enough to clear Miller, who set himself up right on the edge of the circle and clasped it. batsman c Miller b bowler 55(40) [4s-9]"
805,"FOUR, long-off had around 10 yards to cover and he couldn't get there. That is the power of batsman. Races down the wicket and gets to the pitch of the ball, lofts it hard and over extra cover, one bounce and into the fence"
806,"no run, almost thumped it back to bowler. Flatter offie around, Anderson hangs back and punches it straight down the wicket, did not keep it down the ground, bowler is late to react, the ball hits his upper part of his hand and goes to ground. Tough chance but should have been taken"
807,"FOUR, wow! Width offered and batsman is all over it. There was a deep cover fielder and he beat him to his right. Short as well and batsman slaps it in front of square, raced away to the fence"
808,"FOUR, even the mishits are going to the fence, thanks to some sloppy work by Morgan. Short and turning away, batsman pulls and the bottom hand comes off the handle, the ball goes to wide long-on, where Morgan allows it to escape"
809,"out Caught by Eoin Morgan!! Done in for pace. An important wicket for team. batsman was looking to get on with proceedings. Short and angled across off, pulling against the angle is always dangerous, batsman takes it on and splices it towards mid-off. Morgan might be having a rough day with his ground fielding, but not with his catching. Accepts the dolly with ease. batsman c Eoin Morgan b bowler 15(9) [4s-3]"
810,"FOUR, lovely! No fancy shots from Morris. He uses bowler's extra pace to his advantage, stays leg-side of the short of length delivery, opens the bat face and directs it behind square on the off-side, split backward point and short third man expertly"
811,"FOUR, Anderson reminding everyone that he has the second fastest ODI hundred. The extra delivery costing bowler four runs. Length delivery right in the slot, Anderson slams it straight down the ground. Almost knocked the umpire off"
812,"SIX, that's how you cash in. Something for Billings to learn. 95kph slower delivery and Morris picked the bones out of that one, delayed his shot and that allowed it him to send it sailing over long-on. That gets the crowd going as well"
813,"FOUR, round the wicket and dishes in a full toss, the idea was to nail the yorker, missed and Anderson slices it over the infield on the off-side. The fielder was at deep cover and even though the ball plugged in the outfield, he couldn't get there"
814,"out Caught by Mohit Sharma!! Huge wicket this, especially at this stage of the innings. Morris blasted a 9-ball 38 in the previous game against team, coming in at this stage. Short of a length delivery and Morris pulls, he does not bother to keep it down, was planning to clear the fielder. But since it was off the bottom of the bat, it has no wings to fly over Mohit at deep square. batsman c Mohit Sharma b bowler 16(8) [4s-1 6s-1]"
815,"SIX, bowler became predictable there. He was targeting Anderson's pads, missed his length and the Kiwi got underneath that, swung it over the long leg fence and the short Kotla boundaries took care of the rest"
816,"SIX, it was a gamble and it didn't pay off. Darted in on a shortish length, Anderson sets himself up with the front leg cleared, muscles it towards long-on. Maxwell leaps as high as possible, but couldn't even get a finger on it"
817,"FOUR, handy runs these for DD. Not a bad delivery by any means. The wide yorker outside off, Cummins crouches low, opens the bat face and steers it past the diving backward point fielder"
818,"FOUR, yorker followed by a slow short of length delivery, Cummins was waiting for that, he stayed on the back foot and pulled it in front of square, bisected deep mid-wicket and long-on to perfection"
819,"FOUR, switches to round the wicket for Anderson, misses the yorker by a few inches, Anderson smashes the low full toss straight down the ground. No chance for long-on or long-off"
820,"FOUR, you don't often see a batsman play sweep shot to a fast bowler. Let's call this batsman special. Buries on one knee and sweeps it fiercely behind square. Races away to the fence in a jiffy"
821,"SIX, Anderson ends the innings in style. Slower short of length delivery, sat up nicely for Anderson, who waits for it and pulls it to deep square leg. The ball teased the fielder, but he could only palm it over the rope"
822,"FOUR, wow. That was hammered ferociously. batsman charges down the track and smacks it down the ground"
823,"FOUR, batsman is teeing off like a golfer. Uses his feet again, stays a bit leg sidish this time. Fetches the heave from off and directs it through mid-wicket"
824,"FOUR, three in a row. Problems aplenty for bowler. Just not getting his line right. Slants it on the pads, fine leg was inside the ring and batsman will put it away seven days a week and twenty four hours a day. Flicks it past short fine"
825,"SIX, caps off the over with a stinker. Short ball sat up nicely for batsman, he gets on top of it and nails the pull over wide long-on. Just about clears the fence"
826,"1 run, rushes it through outside off, batsman goes deep in his crease and pats it softly to cover"
827,"out Caught by Eoin Morgan!! First wicket for bowler in IPL 2017. Has struck in his first over. Tosses it up this time, the ball dips in a touch. batsman plays down the wrong line, gets a leading edge that ballons up straight to long-off. Morgan ain't dropping those.batsman c Eoin Morgan b bowler 19(18) [4s-2 6s-1]"
828,"out Caught by Saha!! That's an excellent catch from Saha. Credit to Varun, kept persisting it with short pitch stuff and it pays off. After conceding 13 runs in his first over, he shows great courage and picks up a wicket. It was short and drifting down leg, batsman, in a bid to tickle it fine, gloves it to the left of Saha. He flings and settles under it. batsman c Saha b bowler 0(3)"
829,"FOUR, streaky but he won't mind. bowler sees the batsman back away and hurls it full outside off, batsman throws his bat and gets a thickish outside edge that flies through the vacant slip region"
830,"FOUR, top shot from Iyer. Sees the leg-break early, lunges across, opens the bat face and steers it past point. The fielder in the deep gets across and puts in a dive but in vain"
831,"FOUR, easy-peasy for Iyer. Vrooming down leg, Iyer gets inside the line and tickles it fine"
832,"FOUR, brilliant placement from Iyer. Bisects two men in the deep to perfection. Showing a piece of geometry that would put Euclid to shame. bowler strays it on the pads again, Iyer gets right behind it and clips it behind square"
833,"out Lbw!! Shahbaz bowler strikes in his very first over. He's having a wonderful season. The umpire took his time before raising the dreaded finger. Did that pitch in line? Yes, it did and spun away. batsman gets down on one knee and in his attempt to lap it fine, misses it completely. He is pinged on the thigh pad in front of middle and leg. HawkEye confirms that would have hit the leg-pole. Good decision from the umpire. batsman lbw b bowler 3(6)"
834,"out Caught by Nair!! He's cut that straight to backward point this time. That's a big blow. Morgan was starting to find some fluency but he now finds the fielder. Short and wide from Cummins, Morgan goes hard but fails to keep it down and it's straight to Karun Nair. batsman c Nair b bowler 22(20) [4s-3]"
835,"out Caught by Billings!! Is that the game for DD? The in-form batsman is gone for a duck. Too much pressure really. He had to tee off from the word go with the required rate touching 13, and bowler isn't the most straightforward bloke to take on first up. He cleverly bowls it a little wide of off forcing batsman to reach out for his slog-sweep and it comes right off the bottom. It's a top-edge too. Simple catch for Billings at deep mid-wicket. batsman c Billings b bowler 0(2)"
836,"SIX, gosh, that's big from Patel. Way back into the stands. bowler turns one into him this time, Patel goes down quickly and picks the bones out of the slog-sweep. Elevation as well as the distance"
837,"FOUR, his first boundary today and it's come off a thick inside edge past short fine. Anderson bowls this in the blockhole just outside off, batsman jams down on it and squirts it away past leg-stump"
838,"1 run, is that a dropped catch? It looks like it. Another very full ball, batsman crashes it to the right of cover where Zaheer goes across low with both hands but fails to hold on"
839,"out Lbw!! batsman's painful stay at the crease has ended through a full toss. Anderson gets some tail on the delivery and swirls it in on middle, and batsman plays all around it. His head fell over too. The ball crashes into the back leg on the full. Just one of those days for batsman. Never found any timing whatsoever. batsman lbw b bowler 24(28) [4s-1]"
840,"2 runs, bowler only had to gather that and Mohit was gone. But the throw landed very close to him making it difficult. Knuckle ball outside off, Patel punches it through backward point and calls his partner back for two despite the fielder swooping in quickly"
841,"FOUR, short and wide, Patel slashes and slashes hard. The edge flies away through to the third man boundary"
842,"FOUR, he's unwittingly sliced that over short third man. A knuckle ball outside off, Mohit throws his hands at it, the bat-face opens on impact and the ball beautifully lobs over the infield. A bit of a helicopter from Mohit too"
843,"SIX, drills this straight back down the ground. Anderson misses out on the blockhole by a few inches and is hammered by Patel. He's playing a good little knock here. But this chase is beyond his powers"
844,"SIX, another slower ball perhaps? Patel picks it up and nails it over long-on. He's been hitting them really well today"
845,"1 run, dabs a short of length off-cutter straight to short third man. They impetuously run across for a non-existent single. Mohit had given up. No direct hit though"
846,out Bowled!! Off the pads and into leg-stump. Cummins followed Mohit with a full ball as he backed away a touch. The delivery is too quick for Mohit. He misses his swipe through mid-wicket and the ball deflects off the pad to knock over the timber. batsman b bowler 13(14) [4s-1]
847,out Bowled!! Similar technique from batsman - backing away to swish through off. But Morris does him with a yorker. It's too quick for batsman. The ball bursts through to crash into the base of middle. batsman b bowler 1(2)
848,"FOUR, in the air and that's the first boundary of the innings! The knuckle ball on a shortish length, batsman walks down the track and pulls it over mid-wicket. There is no one in the deep and the ball races away"
849,out Bowled!! The leg-bail flies off its groove and that's the game for Delhi. Massive win. Morris causes Patel to go through with the slog too early as he holds it back in pace and the deception is good enough to fetch him his third for the night. batsman b bowler 44(29) [4s-1 6s-3]
850,"FOUR, shot! Perhaps, a safe shot. Stands tall, waits for the ball to come to him and launches this short of a good length delivery over mid-off. One bounce and into the fence"
851,"FOUR, flat and slightly short, batsman backs away and carves it over point. Two fielders chase, but can't chase it down"
852,"out Caught by Zaheer!! Zaheer takes a catch and claims it. The umpires decide to go up and the soft signal is out. It was darted in on off, batsman danced down, moved leg-side and went for the inside-out shot. Couldn't get enough elevation on that and finds Zak at extra cover. The ball was dipping when it approached him, but Zaheer had both his hands underneath the ball. Second wicket for Shahbaz bowler. Now, it's all down to the four foreign recruits for team to make a match out of this. batsman c Zaheer b bowler 7(5) [4s-1]"
853,"FOUR, beautiful shot! See the ball, hit the ball, is the mantra. A round-armish delivery from bowler, batsman who has taken leg-stump guard, has enough room to free his arms. Strokes it over and wide of mid-off to collect his third boundary"
854,"FOUR, wow! Elegant. batsman shuffles across a long way and flicks this full ball around off very fine. No chance for the man at short fine leg. The ball reached the fence in a hurry"
855,"out Caught by Billings!! Would you believe that? batsman perishes to a full toss. There was one fielder in the deep on the leg-side and batsman finds him perfectly. A low full toss on the pads, batsman with a slight shuffle, flicks it in the air and hits it straight down the throat of Billings at long leg. Punjab in a spot of bother. batsman c Billings b bowler 19(12) [4s-4]"
856,"1 run, ah! A direct hit there at the striker's end would have been curtains to Eoin Morgan! batsman taps this length ball to covers with soft hands and sets off. Billings chases it down and fires in a throw quickly. Misses the target just by a few inches"
857,"FOUR, shot! Shortish ball that sits up nicely for Morgan to thwack the pull from outside off. Found the gap between mid-on and mid-wicket and the result was a boundary"
858,"FOUR, a boundary for team after 24 balls. Morgan clears the front leg and spears a full ball through extra-cover. Mid-off was up in the ring and he just had to find the gap"
859,"FOUR, Morgan again. This time it's short and wide and Morgan slaps it hard through point. It beats the diving fielder inside the ring as well as the one at the boundary"
860,"out Caught by Nitish Rana!! The dangerous one is gone and the crowd go wild. bowler is delighted. Smith sees the width outside off on this short of length delivery and slashes hard. Doesn't get enough elevation and finds Nitish Rana at backward point, who jumps and takes a good catch. Smith departs without troubling the scorers. batsman c Nitish Rana b bowler 0(2)"
861,"FOUR, and batsman takes full toll of the free-hit. Bends his back knee and crunches the cover drive wide of the diving extra cover fielder. Once it cleared him, there was none stopping that"
862,"no ball, FOUR, bowler oversteps and bowls a length ball on middle and leg. batsman shuffles across and tucks it very fine. The short fine leg fielder is pretty fine as well. Free-hit coming up"
863,"1 run, fifty for McCullum. A very unlike McCullum innings this. Waves his bat around and is congratulated by his skipper. Looked scratchy to start off and has slowly found his bearings. team would want him to continue. Flatter and on off, worked to deep square leg"
864,"1 run, direct hit and McCullum would have been on his bike. batsman punched this towards extra cover, where Suchith got a good bounce and it was to his strong hand as well. Fires a throw at the striker's end and fails to hit the stumps. McCullum was stretching and would have been touch and go"
865,"out Caught by Rohit!! This was on the cards. batsman kept charging down to the spinners without much success, but he didn't stop trying. Shimmies down and bowler being a clever bowler, tosses it up well outside off, batsman has to reach out for the inside out loft, all he could manage was a slice towards cover-point. Rohit tracks back and takes it over his head while tumbling. Good take that by the team skipper. batsman c Rohit b bowler 28(29) [4s-2]"
866,"SIX, a gift which McCullum accepts with pleasure. Full toss just below the waist, McCullum maintains a low base and helps it along the way, over long leg for a maximum"
867,"FOUR, McCullum has had the wood over bowler in this innings. Continues to collect runs off the Sri Lankan. Full and down leg, McCullum tickles it very fine. No chance for Bumrah in the deep"
868,"out Bowled!! That roar and fist pump says it all. Just takes one delivery for bowler to change the tide. A fine knock from McCullum comes to an end. Battled hard and has built a platform for his lower-order. Straight delivery, McCullum plays all round it, the ball sneaks through bat and pad to hit middle stump. Two set batsmen gone and team keeping the lid over team. batsman b bowler 64(44) [4s-6 6s-3]"
869,"SIX, 200th six this edition. And we are just into the 11th day. Improvisation at its best. batsman moves across his stumps and gets underneath the back of a length delivery, uses the pace of Hardik and scoops it over the fine leg fence"
870,"no ball, FOUR, poor from bowler. First, he oversteps and the yorker is way outside off, batsman stays low and drives it square on the off-side. No chance for the sweeper this time around"
871,"FOUR, bowler has not get his radar right on his yorkers. A low full toss down leg, Kishan is almost down on his knee and swipes it behind square. McClenaghan at fine leg had no chance to cut that off"
872,"FOUR, this is an ordinary over from bowler. 19 runs off it and he like Malinga has been expensive today. Full toss on the pads, batsman says thank you very much and flicks it behind square leg. The man was up inside the ring and the ball was well away from him"
873,"SIX, he is a small man but when he hits them, he certainly packs a punch. Short of length delivery angled across off, batsman goes deep inside the crease and pulls it over deep mid-wicket. Flat and all the way. 50-run stand and 150 up for team"
874,"out Caught by Krunal Pandya!! Something for the 18000 kids to cheer about. bowler has provided the breakthrough. Kishan has been asked to wait by Ravi. The front leg is fine. Legal delivery that and Ravi raises his finger. The back of the hand slower ball dug in short, Kishan takes it on and top edges it to deep square leg. Krunal misjudged it for a second, but recovered well to pouch it. batsman c Krunal Pandya b bowler 11(14) [4s-1]"
875,"SIX, why was batsman held back? Can someone tell me? Such power and timing he possesses. This was more power and the ball cleared Pollard with ease. bowler misses the yorker length and batsman gets under that, though a miscue the ball still goes over long-on with ease. A rare off-day for bowler, finishes with: 4-0-51-1"
876,"FOUR, low full toss and batsman thumps it down the ground. Goes deep and leg-side to free his arms, with mid-off in the ring, he just had to place it wide of him, which he does and collects four"
877,"FOUR, short ball and McCullum latches onto it! No pace behind that delivery to trouble. He waits this slower delivery to come to him and pulls it away wide of the man at 45"
878,"FOUR, trademark McCullum shot! Dances down to a fast bowler and thwacks this length ball down the ground. No chance for the bowler and the ball reaches the fence in a hurry"
879,"SIX, wow! He made that look easy. McCullum waltzes down and bowler shortens his length. But there was enough width outside off for McCullum his free his arms. He expertly elevates over the point region and it has enough wings to go all the way"
880,"SIX, shot! It's the slower ball from bowler and McCullum picks the bones out of it. Waits for it to come to him and muscles it over mid-wicket. Second maximum of the over"
881,"FOUR, another flighted delivery, not much of turn and McCullum brooms it away through mid-wicket. The man in the deep couldn't get there"
882,"FOUR, ends the over with a poor ball. Darts it short, McCullum rockets back and pulls it fiercely through the mid-wicket region"
883,"FOUR, one bounce into the fence! Gets down on one leg and middles the slog sweep. Found the gap between long-on and deep mid-wicket to perfection"
884,out Caught by Roy!! Parthiv goes for a blob. Praveen Kumar is effective with the new ball and once again he gets the breakthrough. Good seam presentation on this good length delivery. It pitches on middle and jags away off the track. Parthiv gets a leading edge looking to work it through the on-side and finds point. Jason Roy collects it in his third attempt. batsman c Roy b bowler 0(2)
885,"FOUR, top shot to get off the mark! Of course, he was helped by Praveen. Drifting down leg, Rana dances down and flicks it over short fine and the ball bullets away into the fence"
886,"FOUR, stand and deliver! No need to run for shots like that. Length ball that sits up nicely for Rana stand tall and drill it wide of the bowler. No chance for mid-on"
887,"1 run, dropped! Jason Roy has put down a dolly. The pacy short ball catches Rana by surprise. He still persists with his pull shot and gets it off the top part of the willow. The ball balloons up on the leg-side. Roy, at mid-wicket, runs back, settles under it and makes a mess of it. Thampi can't believe it. He has to wait for his first IPL wicket"
888,"out Caught by Brendon McCullum!! First IPL game after three years and Munaf has his first wicket. And it is a vital breakthrough. Another start and another stutter for batsman. His rope is coming to an end, especially with Simmons waiting in the wings. Short of a length delivery, batsman pulls and gets it high on the bat, straight down McCullum's throat at long-on. Replays show that it was a slower ball - the leg-cutter and batsman had to manufacture all the pace, which he couldn't. batsman c Brendon McCullum b bowler 26(24) [4s-1 6s-2]"
889,"FOUR, that should get him going. First boundary for batsman this edition. Short and wide delivery, batsman hangs back and relies on placing the ball, cuts it between backward point and short third man"
890,"FOUR, Munaf is not a happy man. Short and wide outside off, batsman cuts it over backward point, where the fielder did not make any effort to catch the ball. He might have lost it in the background. Jadeja was the fielder and he simply stood his ground"
891,"SIX, 120kph slower short of length delivery, sat up nicely for batsman, who pulls it off the front foot, struck it flat and over the wide long-on fence"
892,"SIX, just a lift and off it goes over the long-on fence. For the first time in the over Smith pitches it up, batsman nonchalantly puts it over long-on. Just an extension of the arm and the ball flew away"
893,"FOUR, goes back to the shortish length and takes the pace off as well, batsman pulls and is a touch early into the shot, the bottom hand comes off but the ball is in the gap, wide of deep mid-wicket and four more"
894,"SIX, lovely shot! This is batsman Sharma we all know. Flighted on off, he makes a bit of room to go inside out and connects handsomely, the ball crosses the boundary cushion by a metre or so"
895,"1 run, as expected starts with a slower delivery outside off, batsman drives to sweeper cover"
896,"SIX, just over a leaping McCullum at long-off. Short of length delivery outside off, batsman flat-bats it straight back over Tye, McCullum standing at straightish long-off, jumps up and couldn't even get a finger"
897,"FOUR, a pick up shot and that has almost gone the distance. Angled in on off and middle, batsman flicks it away powerfully. Roy like McCullum was straight at long-on, he can only pick the ball up from the boundary rope"
898,"1 run, run-out chance and Kishan hits the stump mic instead of the stumps. batsman was a goner. Thampi nails the wide yorker, batsman digs it to point and sets off for the single, no response from Rohit and he had to turn back, well short with a direct hit. No one backing up and the duo eventually get the single"
899,"out Caught by Jadeja!! Not over, yet. Still need 17 runs off 11 balls. Credit must go to Thampi for bowling a tight 18th over. batsman had to take the risk and he perishes while doing so. Full and slow, on middle and leg, since there was no pace, batsman could not gather momentum on the flick, skies it towards deep mid-wicket, Jadeja won't drop those. batsman c Jadeja b bowler 39(23) [4s-2 6s-3]"
900,"FOUR, streaky, but team won't mind. The knuckle ball on a fuller length, Hardik had the width to free his arms, throws everything he's got and squirts it off the outside edge behind point, right between backward point and short third man"
901,"FOUR, that must surely do it. Praveen looks befuddled. He comes round the wicket and bowls a low full toss on the stumps, batsman moves across, crouches low, almost on one knee and paddles it fine. With the fielder inside the ring, that was a smart shot"
902,"FOUR, much needed boundary for team! Length ball on middle and leg, batsman moves across and flicks it effortlessly backward of square on the on-side and collects his first boundary"
903,"SIX, wow! That's a batsman special. Easily done. Short of a good length delivery on off, batsman moves across, still has the eyes on the ball and scoops it over the keeper's head. Improvisation at its best"
904,"SIX, shot! That's Raina-esque. Slower ball outside off. Overpitched as well, Rana crouches low and creams the lofted cover drive over extra cover. It came right off the sweet portion of the bat and the ball goes the distance"
905,"SIX, one of the best shots of the day! Short ball at a decent pace, Rana has no trouble in pulling it over square leg for a maximum. He absolutely middled it"
906,"FOUR, wow! That went like a bullet into the fence. Short and wide outside off, Rana jumps and flashes it hard. The ball flies through the point region and races away"
907,"FOUR, what a way to get to yout fifty! Second half-century this season. He cuts the shortish ball outside off and pierces the gap between backward point and short third man"
908,"SIX, wow! 15 runs off the over and team are surely ahead at this stage. Right in the slot for batsman to swing his bat. He prods forward and thumps it over long-on for a huge six"
909,out Caught by Karthik!! batsman has done his job here. End of a fine knock. The knuckle ball from Tye does the trick. Rana wanted to cut hard and all he managed was a faint tickle. The man with the mitts gobbles it up and the umpire spotted the feather. batsman c Karthik b bowler 53(36) [4s-4 6s-2]
910,"SIX, my word, how well has he timed that! bowler appeared to have deceived batsman with a cutter and batsman had to really reach out for it. But his wristwork is a work of genius. He somehow manages to whip the ball away over the deep square leg boundary. Fantastic shot"
911,"FOUR, he's checked this shot down the ground but it still races away off the middle. Back of a length and wide of off, batsman thinks about a cut but changes his mind midway and just jabs it back. The ball was in the air but Thakur can't get down quick enough because it absolutely raced away"
912,"no run, Tiwary drops batsman. Oh you can't do that. Thakur hits the pitch hard on a back of a length outside off, batsman dangles a horizontal bat and edges it for a simple catch to first slip where Tiwary makes a meal of it"
913,"out Caught by Dhoni!! Another chance, and this time there's no mistake. But it's batsman, and not Kohli. Not too dissimilar from that Kohli chance actually. It's a bit short, a bit wide, batsman has a swish at it but he's done in by extra bounce. Simple catch. batsman c Dhoni b bowler 0(3)"
914,"out Stumped!! Oh what a ball. What a ball. He tosses this on off, gets it to dip on AB to draw him out of the crease and then turns it right across him for the stumping. This is a brilliant piece of leg-spin bowling. AB was ambitiously trying to flick this through mid-wicket but he's beaten in flight and length. Dhoni, quick as ever, hardly takes any time to whip those bails off. That's lightning glovework. This is on. batsman st Dhoni b bowler 29(30) [4s-1 6s-2]"
915,"out Bowled!! Jadhav's dragged on. Time was running away and he had to do something, so he gallops down the pitch with an almighty swing but the ball takes a long time to arrive. He's forced to reach out for it outside off, gets a thick inside edge and plays it onto leg-stump. batsman b bowler 18(22)"
916,"FOUR, pace on the ball from bowler and he's been put away. That's not how Thakur and Unadkat were bowling. It skids on nicely from a back of a length for batsman and he flays it through backward point"
917,"FOUR, it took 39 balls for team to get a boundary. And now they've got two in three. Slower ball banged into the pitch outside off, this time batsman gets stuck into it and slashes it into the extra-cover boundary"
918,"out Bowled!! Got him. And that's the big one. It's the slower ball again which does the trick. team have read this pitch like a book. bowler takes the pace off, bangs it on a back of a length and the ball dips underneath batsman as he tries to heave it away. The middle stump is floored. batsman b bowler 14(18) [4s-1]"
919,"SIX, batsman nails this one into the crowd. The slower ball from bowler drifted into his hips, sat up to be put away, and batsman flogged it a long way over long leg. Don't think we're getting the ball back. Someone's taking it home. Ball change required"
920,"FOUR, normal pace short ball, batsman swings into a pull and it takes a thick top-edge to fly over the wicketkeeper. team just about stay in it"
921,"SIX, well, well .. don't go anywhere. This partnership has raced away to 22 off 9. Thakur deviates from the slower ball strategy, bowls it full and wide of off and batsman spanks him over mid-off. That's gone all the way. Flat six"
922,"out Caught by Tripathi!! That's gone straight up. Who wants it? Tripathi is the one settling under it at deep mid-wicket, and he takes it neatly. A real skier. Slower ball which extracts spongy bounce and takes a thick top-edge as batsman slogs. Second for Thakur. batsman c Tripathi b bowler 10(7) [6s-1]"
923,"1 run, what an effort from Stokes. This is stunning fielding. He's actually caught the ball and has control over it, but he doesn't have control over his weight which is causing him to fall over the ropes. So he has to flick it back in - does so incredibly, through his legs. Lots of height from batsman on the slog, fair amount of distance too. Stokes's foot is stationed just a foot inside the ropes at wide long-on, he takes it overhead, and flicks it in. They just take a single"
924,out Bowled!! The middle stump has been planted into its grave. That might be it as far as team's hopes go. batsman moves a mile to the off-side and Thakur keeps it full and straight and fast. batsman b bowler 18(8) [4s-2 6s-1]
925,"1 run, slower back of a length delivery on middle, batsman glances it to short fine leg. Badree was struggling had Thakur hit direct"
926,"out Bowled!! Floors middle stump yet again. Has he stepped up today or what?! Exceptional from bowler, and even Shardul. He's slowed this up beautifully and batsman is through his slog too early. batsman b bowler 0(1)"
927,"out Bowled!! Bang on top of off-stump. These bowlers are helping themselves to some good wickets here. Three for bowler now. Cuts his fingers across the ball while bowling it into the pitch, it doesn't bounce as much as batsman wants. Right under his swipe. batsman b bowler 2(3)"
928,"FOUR, what a start from AB! He smokes this off the back foot past backward point. Short and wide from Thakur, and a player of AB's class won't miss out"
929,"SIX, he's hit that straight into the stage where a display car is kept. He sat on that slower ball. It was a touch on the shorter side, AB is quick to rock back before mowing it over wide long-on"
930,"FOUR, the edge just eludes a flying Stokes at backward point. Nice and full from Thakur, drawing batsman across into a drive. The ball holds its line slightly to take a thick outside edge. Such a good effort from Stokes. Can't get a hand though"
931,"FOUR, batsman walks at Thakur who bowls a slower ball on middle and leg. That's batsman's bread and butter shot. A beautiful wristy flick through mid-wicket fetches him another boundary"
932,"out Caught by Rahane!! bowler has batsman. That's a really sharp short ball. batsman was on the move down the pitch, bowler bangs it in and gets it around head high. batsman still doesn't back down. He has a big swish at it and probably caught it right off the bottom of the bat. It slices up in the air for a simple catch to Rahane at sweeper cover. Another wicket, especially of AB, and things will get really interesting. batsman c Rahane b bowler 28(19) [4s-3 6s-1]"
933,"SIX, bowler flights it up and AB immediately clatters him over long-off. Just got the length wrong there. It was a bit too full outside off. Still, it's a superb shot as AB had to reach out"
934,"FOUR, a full toss. First up. Dictates terms right away does batsman with a lean forward in whipping it through the on-side. Quite a warm up this"
935,"FOUR, decides to take matters into the leg-side. Reaches out to the pitch of the delivery and forces it with a dragging slog bisecting the men guarding cow corner"
936,"SIX, whoa. The beast mode is out. And the ball has been tonked into one of the metros going around. batsman is back to his earlier avatar of galloping down to spinners and just swings the bat keeping it as straight as possible. Laced over long-on. Has to be the biggest of this season"
937,"FOUR, a wasted delivery. Well down leg and all batsman has to do with these is get some wood. And he gets a whole chunk on it. Flicks it away off his pads"
938,"FOUR, a real sitter. Quite a nothing delivery this from bowler. Neither full nor short enough. Gives batsman all the time to open himself up and spot the area to place this angry pull of his. Decides it would be cow corner to take the brunt"
939,"FOUR, the edges spoil the over. The scrambled leg-cutter this from Watto with a hint of width as well. batsman gets his drive around 90-degrees finer than he had planned. Off the outside edge and through the vacant cordon"
940,out Bowled!! Plays it on. And it is the age-old trick of firing in the yorkers that does the trick. batsman loads himself up for a version of his helicopter. But the ball is just wide enough to kiss the inside edge and ricochet to make a real mess of the timber. A much needed pull back into the contest for team - a contest that could well have gone outside the park. batsman b bowler 28(25) [4s-3 6s-1]
941,out Bowled!! Two in a row. And is both the batsmen who'd done all the hard work in setting themselves up for the final slog. bowler comes back with an off-cutter and keeps the aim up and right on the money. Stays much lower as well. Through the defences and under the early pull to light up the zing bails once again. batsman b bowler 27(24) [4s-3]
942,out Caught by Mandeep!! They are falling apart. Three wickets in the span of six balls. All the momentum that seemed to have drifted Pune's way has surely been redirected via the national highway to Bangalore. A fullish delivery this and full-paced as well for a change. batsman executes the clip but fails to keep it down. Doesn't get it high enough either. The middle path treaded takes the lob into the safe palms of deep square leg. batsman c Mandeep b bowler 1(3)
943,out Bowled!! The stumps just keep flying. The heart of Pune being ripped apart here. And so is this innings. A length delivery assumed to be in the slot for the slog here from batsman. He lines up neatly and does everything right in swinging his ba putting all forearms to good use. Just that there is hardly any bounce here to sit up for the timing to come out right. Scoots under the flat bat and sends the off-pole on a cartwheel. batsman b bowler 2(3)
944,out Caught by de Villiers!! Oh dear. This is a collapse of enormous magnitudes. Faster than some of the vehicles that line up in the evenings on the Bangalore roads. Goes for the slower one on a length outside off. Thakur looks to check his drive but the sticker on the pitch makes him check his shot. He does so and chips it to a flying AB at cover. batsman c de Villiers b bowler 0(1)
945,"FOUR, a juicy full toss, with generous width dished out as well. Smoked off the middle of the bat sinking onto the front knee as well making it one for the cameras. Pune need a lot more of these"
946,"FOUR, pitched up. Right in the slot to be spanked. And Tiwary doesn't disappoint. Once again leans onto his front knee and just swings his bat through the line. A lot straighter this time"
947,"FOUR, some runs scrapped here. In style rather. Those wrists employed in executing the lofted drive over extra cover. Finding the gap to perfection. bowler for some reason doesn't believe in not dishing out half volleys at this stage of the game"
948,"SIX, even better. The gorgeousness of the shots increases in an arithmatic progression. Much straighter this from bowler but once again off a generous half volley length. A seam up and dispatched into the sight screen with a full flowing drive"
949,"SIX, up and dispatched. Gives his side something to bowl at on this graveyard. bowler after bowling an eviable yorker misses the next. A cool few inches short and enough time for Tiwary to get under it in whipping it over the top. Behind square and into the stands"
950,"FOUR, right off the screws. A charge down the track in perpendiculars moving down and away in the same motion. All the breathing space for his arms in slicing it with all the power through the covers"
951,"leg byes, FOUR, down leg. And dealt with a nurdle off the thighs. Going past the glance and runs away into the long leg ropes"
952,"FOUR, whoa. Take that for timing. All of it employed here on duty tonight. Leans onto the front leg and shows the full bat face in spanking a lofted drive over the bowler's head. Holds the pose to make it all the more elegant"
953,"out batsman Run Out!! 1 run completed. Surrenders in the quest fo an extra run. But he's done his job. Squeezes out a fullish one, almost whipping it in the process to long-on. A charge in and a good throw at the keeper's end ensures that Tiwary's desperate diving attempt to get back in for the second is futile. So, 161 is what Pune manage. batsman run out (Kohli/Kedar Jadhav) 27(11) [4s-3 6s-2]"
954,"FOUR, make that 17 off the over. After the polite timing, batsman gets out his violent streak now. Crashes the cut ferociously. Square like a tracer"
955,"SIX, nothing streaky this time. bowler looks for another one to fox the batsman getting too predictable in the process. A mighty swing taking the ball into the clouds before getting it to settle over long-on. Jee, this target setting is getting scary"
956,"FOUR, width now. Nothing going Bangalore's way. The length isn't either. A friendly sit up and smashed away with a flaying cut. Reintroduced into the fence"
957,"FOUR, deft. Delicate. Cheeky. The wide slip tactic not quite making much sense now. With batsman using his surgical precision in bisecting the man out there and the keeper with his delayed steer"
958,"FOUR, they're racing through. Brings up the half-ton stand as well. Watto decides to get defensive with a wide dart. Not quite the case with batsman already stooping low and reaching out in drilling it behind point"
959,"out Bowled!! The break does the trick. In the form of the strategy to introduce spin back. As has been a trend all through the tourney, the leg-spinners's wrong 'uns keep getting the rewards. Floats it up inviting batsman to get forward on the drive. And then gets the ball to dip in sharply going through the tiny gap between the bat and pad to light up the timber. Much needed slow down this for Bangalore. batsman b bowler 30(25) [4s-5]"
960,"FOUR, bursts through the hands. bowler's. Was a polite drill down this squeezing out the fuller one from batsman as he smashes it back. The bowler, slow to get low has a boundary against his name"
961,"out Caught by Kohli!! All the timing. All the power. All the elegance. Just that there is a certain Kohli in the way. Clears his front leg, gets his eyeline right on the ball and looks to go for the inside-out slap through the covers. Intercepted and a dive to his left plucks this one out of thin air. Diving low as well in the process. A real stunner. batsman c Kohli b bowler 31(23) [4s-3 6s-1]"
962,"FOUR, threatens to come down. Charge down in fact. All he does in the process is fool bowler into thinking the same and fire one wide. Adjusts and reaches out in slapping it behind point. A confidence boosting boundary"
963,"FOUR, the punches are out. A wide, short combo this and dealt with a certain degree of aplomb. Shows the leather the full face of the blade and crashes it through backward point"
964,"FOUR, wow! What a shot to get off the mark. Length ball right in the slot for batsman to swing his bat. Stands tall and lofts the on-drive"
965,"FOUR, four more! batsman isn't afraid to play his strokes. Sees the width outside off and throws the kitchen sink. Gets it well wide of backward point. No chance for third man"
966,"FOUR, that's timing and placement! ""That's class,"" calls Sunny G on air. Just a hint of width outside off on this back of a length dlivery and batsman just taps it on the off-side. Pierces the gap between backward point and cover-point. The quick outfield does the rest"
967,"FOUR, beautiful shot. With mid-off up inside the circle, bowler pitches it up outside off. Iyer spots it and caresses the drive. It was uppish, but in the gap. 12 runs off the tenth over"
968,"FOUR, placed to perfection. Flighted on middle, batsman sinks down to one knee and sweeps, not quite off the middle, but got it in the gap at deep square leg. The fielder tries to flick the ball in play, but in vain"
969,"FOUR, that ruins the over. Like Nair, Iyer also moved to leg, but he kept his options open and didn't committ to one shot, waited for the short ball and cut it behind point"
970,"out batsman Run Out!! 1 run completed. It was a risky second and Iyer pays the price. It was his call and he was running to the danger end, took on de Grandhomme and came second. The knuckle ball on middle, nudged softly into the mid-wicket region. The Kiwi charged in from the rope and fired a flat throw right next to the stumps to Uthappa, who did the rest. Even a dive from Iyer was not enough to save him. Another start for Iyer that he doesn't convert. batsman run out (de Grandhomme/Uthappa) 26(17) [4s-4]"
971,"no run, dropped! The penalty you pay for fielding a part-time wicket-keeper. The flatter knuckle ball around off, batsman moved away to the leg-side and tried to force it off the back foot, the outside edge goes straight in and straight out of Uthappa's gloves. That would have been two set batsmen removed in one over"
972,out Bowled!! This was coming. batsman was struggling against bowler and he perishes looking to play a wild stroke. NCN darted it full and on the stumps. batsman clears his front leg and wants to heave it over the on-side. Doesn't bring the bat anywhere close to the ball and the it strikes the base of middle. batsman b bowler 21(27) [4s-1]
973,"SIX, wow! Floated up outside off, batsman had the width to free his arms and he made no mistake, lofts it high and over the long-off fence. Almost nailed the electronic scoreboard"
974,"SIX, the yorker gone wrong. Low full toss just outside off, batsman brings that strong bottom hand into play, gets underneath it and sends it sailing over the long-on fence. What a hit!"
975,"FOUR, short and outside off, batsman cuts up and over backward point. Used the pace of Umesh and never thought about keeping it down the ground, one bounce and into the fence"
976,"SIX, 16 off three balls. That is what he can do. Length delivery on the pads, batsman crouches low and plays the pick-up shot to perfection, sent it packing over backward square leg"
977,"SIX, wasn't Umesh the best pacer for India in the Test season? He's been taken to the cleaners by the youngster. Third six in the over and already 22 off the over. team will be hurting by this onslaught. Fuller and around off, batsman clears his front leg and dispatched it over wide long-on"
978,"FOUR, geez! He hits them hard. 26 runs off the over and Umesh has taken a pasting. From 1/27 he ends with 1/53. Very full and outside off, batsman drills the drive past the diving extra cover fielder. The ball rocketed to the fence"
979,"out Bowled!! This is not what you expect from an experienced campaigner. With Pant going brilliantly, batsman just needed to give the strike to the youngster. Instead he advances and fails to pick the offie, the ball breaks back in and hits the top of leg-stump. batsman b bowler 1(4)"
980,"FOUR, you need confidence to play that shot, especially against bowler. The off-break turning in, Morris reverse sweeps it over backward point. Not off the middle, but once it cleared the infield it was going to be four"
981,"out Caught by Gambhir!! GG exults. But the damage might have been done. Third wicket for NCN and he's been an inspired selection today. Low full toss outside off, batsman had to reach out for that, slices it low to backward point, where GG clings on. A fine knock from the youngster that. Gave DD the momentum going into the final overs. batsman c Gambhir b bowler 38(16) [4s-2 6s-4]"
982,"1 run, dropped! Tough chance, but when you get two hands, you have to catch it. Short delivery and Morris is hurried into the pull, spliced towards long-on. Umesh runs forward and across, overruns and the ball comes near his waist while he was diving forward, hits his hands and pops out. GG is not happy with the effort"
983,"1 run, Morris living a charmed life. Now, GG puts one down. What do you say now skipper? Umesh might be asking. It was a straightforward chance unlike his. Slower delivery and Morris is early into the drive, toe-ends it towards extra cover. It was going in slow motion and GG lost it in the background. The ball hit his fingers and went to ground"
984,"FOUR, short delivery on middle and leg, that is easy pickings for a South African, Morris swivels and pulls it towards long leg. Bounced just before the ad cushions"
985,"FOUR, streaky but DD won't mind. The slower delivery but had the space for Morris to throw the kitchen sink, the outside edge flies fine and down to the third man fence"
986,"out Caught by U Yadav!! Clever bowling from bowler. Dug in the slower short ball, Morris delayed his shot after reading it off the surface, the idea was to ramp it over short third man, since there was no pace the ball balloons to Umesh, who makes no mistake this time. batsman c U Yadav b bowler 16(9) [4s-3]"
987,"FOUR, starts with a leg-stump half-volley and gets the treatment it deserves. batsman leans forward and whips it through mid-wicket and the ball bullets away. No need to run for shots like that"
988,"FOUR, wow! He strokes and stands still on the crease, posing for the photographs. Length ball just outside off, batsman presses forward and caresses the cover drive. Finds the gap superbly"
989,"FOUR, four more! This time he uses the pace and bounce to good effect. 141kph short ball outside off, batsman opens his bat face at the last instant and runs it wide of the keeper. Third man gave it a chase, but in vain"
990,"FOUR, exquisite. He's seeing the cricket ball like a football. All timing. He is not trying to hit the leather hard. Pitched up delivery, batsman leans onto it and drives it between mid-off and extra cover. Umesh Yadav leaks 17 runs off his opening over"
991,"FOUR, starts with a full toss on leg. Easy-peasy for batsman. He clips it in front of square on the on-side"
992,"2 runs, to long on, 50-run stand in the fifth over. A gentle nudge into the leg-side, followed by a quick double"
993,"out Caught by Uthappa!! The umpire took ages to raise his finger. Perhaps, it looked like he had a look at his partner before making the decision. The partnership is broken, courtesy short ball down leg. batsman would have smacked that past the ropes nine times out of ten. But, not today. He attempted the pull and all he managed was a glove onto it. Uthappa moves to his left and pouches it. batsman c Uthappa b bowler 21(17) [4s-2]"
994,"FOUR, cheeky, delicate and effective. Uses the slightest of width on this short ball outside off and sends it wide of the keeper by opening his bat face. It was an off-pace delivery as well. He waited for the ball till the last moment before making contact"
995,out Caught by Uthappa!! Umesh Yadav strikes and removes the big fish. He bowled much better compared to his first spell and earns himself a wicket. It was a pacy Test match line and length. Short of a good length delivery on fourth-fifth stump line. batsman gets a faint outside tickle looking to run it down towards third man. Settles into the safe mitts of Uthappa. batsman c Uthappa b bowler 39(25) [4s-7]
996,"FOUR, that's harsh on the bowler. That didn't deserve to go to the boundary. It was banged in short and bowler bent his back there. Iyer is surprised by the pace and bounce on that delivery. He jumps and just sticks his bat out hoping that it doesn't hit him. The ball flies past the keeper off his shoulder and dribbles away into the third man fence. The umpire thinks it came off the bat and gives four runs"
997,"FOUR, welcome to Delhi says Iyer. Shortish and wide outside off, Iyer treks back and fiercely cuts it behind square on the off-side. Gets it well out of the reach of backward point"
998,"out Caught by Billings!! Zak attack strikes. Trap set and trap sprung. So, batsman's promotion fails. Lasted for just two balls. It was a fuller length delivery on off-stump line, batsman went for a half-hearted flick. It appeared that the ball might have stopped on the wicket. Nonetheless, he was early into the shot and it was the slower ball from bowler that fooled the batsman there. Skies it towards deep square leg. Billings sprawls in forward and pouches it with ease. bowler roars in delight. batsman c Billings b bowler 1(2)"
999,"FOUR, that's a gift and batsman accepts it gleefully. Half-volley on off-stump, batsman takes it from there and flicks it fiercely past mid-on. Rockets away to the fence"
1000,"FOUR, too full and too easy. Wafted full outside off, batsman leans forward, presents a nice high elbow and creams it past mid-off"
1001,"FOUR, batsman gets off the mark with a boundary. Pivots back to this short ball and nails the pull in front of square on the on-side"
1002,"FOUR, this is intentional stuff from Pandey. Waits in his crease till the last instant, opens the bat face and runs it through the vacant slip region"
1003,"SIX, that's a pressure-releaser. Jogs down the track and uses his wrists to good effect. Flicks it handsomely over square leg. there were two men in the deep. All they could do was watch it sail over the rope"
1004,"SIX, can't get away with this full toss! Pathan brings up his fifty in style. He clears his front leg and swings his bat hard. Finds the gap between long-on and deep mid-wicket and has enough power to go all the way as well"
1005,"3 runs, 100-run stand between the duo. Another low full toss, Pathan gets underneath the delivery and drills it down the ground. Morris from long-off dives full length to his right and flicks the ball back in play. The other fielder (Nair) from long-on fires in a throw, but he can't stop the duo from taking the third. Excellent running"
1006,"FOUR, 15 off the over and bowler isn't happy. Probably with himself. After serving all those full tosses, he drifts one down leg. Pandey moves across and gets a faint tickle. No chance for Pant who put in a desperate dive. The ball dribbles away into the fence"
1007,"FOUR, this is a gift and Pathan collects it with both hands. Full toss down leg, Pathan gets enough wood on his wild bat-swing and gets it very fine"
1008,out Caught&Bowled!! Much needed breakthrough for the home team. The short ploy does the trick. Morris bangs it in short at a good pace. Pathan is hurried on his pull and the ball lobs up off the top-edge. Morris calls for it moving to his left and takes a safe catch. batsman c and b bowler 59(39) [4s-6 6s-2]
1009,"FOUR, cheeky shot! Full and on off, Pandey opens his bat face at the last instant and steers it between the keeper and short third man. 10 runs off the wicket, in spite of Pathan's wicket"
1010,"1 run, a fore-handed stroke to send this short ball to long-on. Manish Pandey notches up his fifty with that single"
1011,"out Caught by Zaheer!! Is there a twist here? With mid-off inside the circle, it was worth taking the gamble. But, Yadav didn't get the desired result. The pace off the ball did the trick here. Yadav moved leg-side and mishit the lofted-off drive straight to mid-off. The bat turned at the point of impact. batsman c Zaheer b bowler 7(9)"
1012,"out Stumped!! Delhi is going Mishy, Mishy, Mishy. A dot followed by a wicket. He completely foxes batsman with this tossed up leg-break. batsman's weight takes him forward, who wanted to deposit it away with a slog sweep. The back leg is well in front of the crease. Pant whips off the bails in a flash. The only doubt in the third umpire's mind was if Pant gathered it behind the stumps. It's touch and go. The benefit of doubt goes to the keeper. OUT flashed on the giant screen. batsman st Pant b bowler 3(5)"
1013,"SIX, wow! Six and team need just 2 now. It was darted outside off. Pandey does a Dhoni! He moves slightly across and thumps it over long-on. Cummins was coming forward and I reckon he misjudged it there. Had he held his ground, he might have had a better chance"
1014,"out Caught by Pant!! batsman combusts. No tryst with destiny for batsman today. Top nut from Cummins, overcorrects his length and hurls in the sucker ball outside off. batsman goes for a booming drive sans any feet movement. This was the away curler, he doesn't account for the swing. Ekes out an outside edge that flies to Pant, who dives to his right and completes a fine catch. batsman c Pant b bowler 4(2) [4s-1]"
1015,"out Caught by Mathews!! bowler is on a roll. One more down. What is happening to team? The skipper departs. The frustration was conspicuous, he wanted to break the shackles. bowler is clever, he bowls one full and gets it to veer away a touch. batsman slogs wildly across the line, gets a leading edge that balloons in the air towards cover. He gave the charge there. Doesn't matter anyway. Mathews takes a couple of steps backwards and hangs onto it safely. batsman c Mathews b bowler 14(12) [4s-2]"
1016,"no run, rib-tickler this time, tucked straight to short fine. Wanted a single but wisely sent back by his partner. A direct-hit from Morris would've been close"
1017,"FOUR, elegance written all over it. So flowy and effortless from Pathan. Like a liquid. A fuller length delivery in the slot, Pathan stands motionless and lifts it straight over the bowler's head. Holds the pose for the cameras after playing the shot"
1018,"FOUR, that's a stinker and gets punished. Shortens his length but sprays it on leg-stump line. Pathan rolls his wrists and directs it past the man at 45"
1019,"FOUR, wow. That's a ripper from Cummins. Came out of nowwhere. Bangs it short, rears up viciously. Pathan is startled by the bounce, went for a pull and gets a top-edge onto his helmet. Flies over the keeper's head for a one bounce boundary"
1020,"FOUR, no half measures this time. Rocks back and butchers it over mid-on. Couple of bounces and into the fence"
1021,"FOUR, the short ball isn't working for Cummins. Pandey backs away and unleashes the pull in front of square on the on-side"
1022,"SIX, how on earth did it go over the ropes? bowler looks flabbergasted. Almost did in with this off-pace delivery, Pathan was months early into the shot, ends up mistiming it but such is his power that it went all the way for a maximum over deep mid-wicket. Pathan ended up hitting that with the use of one hand as the bottom hand came off"
1023,"SIX, fabulous shot. Uses his feet, reaches the pitch and tonks one over long-on. Went sailing into the stands"
1024,"1 run, flays this flatter ball through cover. 50-stand up"
1025,"FOUR, didn't get it where he intended but still earns himself a boundary. bowler drops it shorter again, Pathan went for a muscular blow across the line, the ball takes the top-half of the blade and loops over bowler's head. Races away to the fence"
1026,"out Lbw!! That's plumb. Out. Gone. Dead. batsman has played right across a full one and missed it. The ball hurries on to hit low on his pad in front of middle and that's crashing into the stumps. Not a great deal of movement, just a hint of inswing but batsman falters by opting to play across the line first up. batsman lbw b bowler 0(1)"
1027,"FOUR, four first ball for batsman who has promoted himself to No. 3. Full on leg-stump, the ball is ducking in sharply and batsman just about gets some bat on it to help it along while yanking his leg away"
1028,"FOUR, lots of width from Sran and batsman lashes him over cover-point. He had no intentions of keeping it along the ground, which is the way to go when you're going hard at it. Even if an edge is found, it will fly"
1029,"FOUR, right up under batsman's bat and he punches it fiercely over mid-on. A full ball on leg-stump, batsman opens his stance up, gets his front leg out of the way and times it nicely"
1030,"out Bowled!! Done him with the googly. Actually, batsman picks this one but he anticipates the ball to come back in a lot more than it does, so he ends up playing inside the line of it. It goes past his outside edge and knocks over off-stump. What a comeback from bowler after being hammered in his first over. batsman b bowler 0(2)"
1031,"no run, spills a return catch. batsman hits it straight back at him but it's not coming too fast and the height is pretty comfortable too. He should have taken it"
1032,"FOUR, too many deliveries on the shorter side in this over and batsman finally gets hold of one. He rocks back and pulls it away wide of long-on"
1033,"FOUR, almost an action replay of the previous shot. An ordinary over from bowler to complete what has been a fine spell. Short again, batsman belts it in the same place on the field"
1034,"out Caught by Dhawan!! Full and wide, batsman throws his hands at it to carve it over extra-cover. The bat turns in his hands and he eventually slices it straight to deep point. team are in tatters now. No real firepower to come. batsman c Dhawan b bowler 7(12)"
1035,"2 runs, more than a dropped catch, that's two runs saved. A fine stretch from Nabi at short third man to get fingertips to the ball. batsman wanted to ramp this back of length delivery above him, and was so nearly successful"
1036,"SIX, batsman, what a strike! Never mind my comment that they have no real firepower to come. This has been caned over point. Full and wide from Sran, Mohit clatters it away"
1037,"SIX, two sixes in three balls. The required rate is back under 12. Handsome strike from batsman, crunching the full ball over long-on to bring up his half-century"
1038,"FOUR, what an over this is turning out to be! 18 already with 2 balls to go. He errs in line with this slower ball, gets it full on middle and leg and batsman whips it wide of deep mid-wicket. The ball sneaks through the fielder as he slides across. Warner isn't happy"
1039,"FOUR, the bowler is under pressure too here. Even someone as confident as Rashid. He drops it short, allows batsman to rock back and he belts it over square leg. Bounces just inside the ropes"
1040,"SIX, short again, this time it's all the way. It might have been a googly, but it's way too short. batsman nails the pull over long leg"
1041,"SIX, what a stunning hit over long-on. batsman is playing an absolute blinder here to spring the game back to life. A flighted leg-break on off, batsman doesn't bother using his feet. Just a stride forward to smash it through the line"
1042,"FOUR, massive over. 21 off it. Rashid errs down leg, sits up for batsman on the hips and he whips it away past short fine leg. He beats deep backward square too"
1043,"out Caught by Dhawan!! bowler to the rescue for team again. He has easily been the bowler of the tournament so far and he has executed under pressure once more. A back of a length leg-cutter which is wide of off, makes Mohit reach out and he slices it up straight to sweeper cover. batsman c Dhawan b bowler 10(5) [6s-1]"
1044,"FOUR, batsman keeps going. He's batting on another planet out there. The timing off his bat, magnificent. This is a full toss in all fairness, batsman is deep in the crease, he uses the pace and slices it away through point"
1045,"1 run, put down, put down! Dhawan seemed to have grabbed that for a split second, but no, it's down. Back of a length outside off, batsman carves it off the back foot but he's hit it very close to sweeper cover. The ball was travelling though and Dhawan can't hang onto it as he was on the move"
1046,"SIX, he's not mis-hit one delivery, not that I can remember. What we're watching is something very special. A length ball wide of off, this is actually a pretty decent delivery. But batsman's arc has widened so humongously tonight that he's able to fetch it over long-on. Just over the fielder"
1047,"out Bowled!! Leg-stump out of the ground. They're checking the front foot, but bowler's fine. That's insanely good execution of the yorker under pressure. batsman gives the charge looking to smack it down the ground but he's really not playing the odds. The ball fizzes under him. batsman b bowler 1(5)"
1048,"out Lbw!! Low full toss, and flush on the back pad. Oh what a shame that is for batsman. He's been absolutely phenomenal on the night, but falls just short of the finishing line. That's absolutely plumb, no question. On the flip side, how good has bowler been?! It's a five-for for him. batsman lbw b bowler 95(50) [4s-9 6s-5]"
1049,"out Bowled!! Siddarth Kaul has done it. He has produced the perfect delivery, a delivery which he'll remember for the rest of his life. A ripping yorker which goes right through batsman and hammers the base of off-stump. Ecstasy for team, agony for team. batsman b bowler 2(5)"
1050,"out Caught by Warner!! Bhuvi has done him with the leg-cutter. This is a huge breakthrough for the home side. Really smart bowling. He knows batsman's after him so the line is a bit wide of off, the leg-cutter means that there is extra bounce too. Hence, instead of sitting up for batsman's heave over mid-on, the ball slices up in the air towards long-off where Warner has no problems in gobbling it up. The skipper's pumped. batsman c Warner b bowler 10(12) [4s-2]"
1051,"SIX, bowls it short first ball and Morgan is quick to pump him over long-on. Swiftly jumps onto the back foot and thumps a flat pull over the ropes"
1052,"FOUR, spots the googly out of the hand and lofts it over mid-off. The line was a bit too wide of off which was a giveaway too. A good forward stride from batsman before hitting through the line"
1053,"SIX, oh my goodness, the sound that made! Wow. Rashid flights the leg-break up around off, batsman quickly goes down on the back knee and belts a slog-sweep into the second tier over mid-wicket"
1054,"FOUR, he's nailed that extra-cover drive too. Rashid under the pump for the first time this season. A little shimmy down the pitch to get close to the pitch and drills it with the turn"
1055,out Bowled!! Snuck through him. bowler slides one on from round the wicket and completely cramps Morgan. Morgan may have initially wanted to cut it away but the ball just skids on rapidly and cleans up middle and leg. Poor shot against someone like bowler who doesn't turn the ball a great deal. batsman b bowler 13(17) [6s-1]
1056,"out Bowled!! What a horrible shot that is. It's a leg-break pitching on middle and leg, and batsman is still trying to manufacture a cut through point. The zip from Rashid fizzes the ball right through him and knocks over the top of leg-stump. Really poor shot selection. batsman b bowler 1(6)"
1057,"FOUR, sinks on the sweep. Barely gets himself in control of it. The stride doesn't even get close enough to the pitch of the delivery as he top-edges it in the end. Has a boundary to his name with the man charging in from fine leg sacrificing some runs in the quest of looking to take the catch"
1058,"FOUR, the usual trick. But conventional this time. Sweeps with all his muscle and his big bat has it in it to almost take it all the way over"
1059,"2 runs, a calm looking pat through mid-wicket. And pulls his partner back for the second. Makes the dive as well as Maxwell charges in from the mid-wicket fence and misses with the direct hit. Had he hit, Ojha would've been gone"
1060,"FOUR, the line-looser. Ends up with a freebie going down leg and all he does it get some of his swat on it to take it past the keeper. That's all he had to do. A graceful acceptance"
1061,"FOUR, cheeky. Deft too in equal proportion. Moves away, manufactures room and opens his bat face ever so late in guiding it very fine"
1062,"SIX, whoa. Take that. A gallop down the track, inherits the ball right in the slot and just swings the bat all along. A massive swing and lofts it over deep mid-wicket. Several rows inside"
1063,"FOUR, a juicy full toss. Had to be dispatched. It sure was. But almost laterally opposite to where he was looking for. Tries punching it through the covers, gets it a lot more of the edge than he would have liked and gets it through the cordon. The half-ton of the stand comes up"
1064,out Stumped!! Too greedy. Dances down the track in looking to deposit another one of those crowd catchers. bowler smartly fires in the leg-break and darts it wide too. Wide enough for the ball to sneak under the bat on the move. Foxed by the wide angle starting from the corner of the crease. Saha doesn't mind some more work. batsman st Saha b bowler 34(20) [4s-2 6s-1]
1065,"FOUR, the loss of radar. Five consecutive half-centuries for batsman against Punjab. Has to be the most difficult one. Certainly the slowest. Gets there with a tuck off his hips in ensuring that it is fine enough for fine leg to cut it off"
1066,"FOUR, clears the front leg, adopts the line and then reintroduces the ball into the fence. After quite some time. Much needed this for the crowd to find their lost voice back. Sinks and lofts the drive through the line"
1067,"FOUR, moves all around in his crease. Then sits. And turns right handed. Mohit meanwhile fires in a low full toss. Only to watch it be slogged through the tiny gap in the cover fortress"
1068,"out Caught by Sandeep Sharma!! A compulsive pull brings about the downfall. The ball right at the neck and Hooda cannot resist not throwing his bat at it. Takes his eyes off though and trusts his instincts in executing the hook. The instincts only manage a top edge, a balloon that gains enough elevation but into the palms of Sandeep behind square. batsman c Sandeep Sharma b bowler 12(10) [4s-1]"
1069,"FOUR, a hang on the front foot and keeps his mace flat as he forearms a smash back past the bowler. So typically batsman"
1070,out Caught by Miller!! Another short ball. Another top-edge. Another catch. The tried and tested ploy of snaring wickets all day fetches another. Sandeep persist bending his back and banging it in. More of the kick up on this occasion. Gets too big for batsman in the end as he throws his bat up in the air and just swishes it cross faced. Off the cue end to deep mid-wicket. batsman c Miller b bowler 2(3)
1071,"SIX, bursts through the hands. Oh Morgan. Such has been the standard set these days that you expect these to be picked out. A low full toss here and batsman reaches out on a knee, almost rolls over in the process too. But imparts the final few breaths of energy in him to loft it over long-off, where Morgan gets his hands up but in the quest of keeping himself inside the rope lets the ball sneak through"
1072,"FOUR, just the ideal sitting up length. Bangs it in but the pitch just doesn't allow the ball to do anything cheeky. Right in the slot and swatted away flat batted through backward square"
1073,"SIX, that's how it is done. A banged in sitter and Rashid just stands tall and slogs. Connects right with the middle of his sweet spot and in the only ball he faces gets the ball into the crowds. Over long-on. 159 is what the Sunrisers manage"
1074,"out Caught by Saha!! A troubled stay this. And Mohit saves him further problems. The peppery bouncer comes out right, half way down the pitch and gaining in altitude even on this sluggish track. batsman meanwhile looks to take it on with his swivelling turn in hooking it away. All he manages in the end it a kiss off the glove for a smart Saha to pouch it behind with his fingers venturing upwards. batsman c Saha b bowler 15(15) [4s-1]"
1075,"FOUR, nails the reverse. Switches grips, turns around, sits down and creams the broom behind square. A whistler this"
1076,"SIX, the usual suspect. To deal with the mystery spin. batsman pre-plans his switch. Gets quickly the other way and fetches this off the middle stick to slog-sweep it away over point"
1077,out Stumped!! The familiar ploy. The ploy of taking the time-out to get yourself a wicket. Plays itself out yet again tonight. Patel floats it up generously and batsman looks to unsettle the new man with a charge down and an aimless slog. Misses the line completely and is undone by the sharp turn on offer as well. Saha ain't missing out on these bail-whips. batsman st Saha b bowler 9(16)
1078,"out Caught by Saha!! Saha yells. Gets no response. Keeps yelling. And the umpire relents. A massive wicket this, and bowler gets himself two in two. Slightly wider this and batsman looks to search for the turn playing a push away from his body. A faint tickle in the end and has the guilty look in his eyes of looking back. batsman c Saha b bowler 0(1)"
1079,out Caught by Mandeep!! Something always coming. A big shot. A big heave. A big miscue. Sees the shortened length for a change does Smith and looks to post it into the night sky. Just that gravity gets hold of the skier that initially was a mistimed pull with a swivel and finds the lone man at the square leg fence to pouch it. batsman c Mandeep b bowler 1(4)
1080,"out Caught by Kohli!! Guess who's pumped. Looked at who caught this. This was actually too short a ball to be lofted downtown. batsman still goes for it, his bat ending up slicing the ball to long-on. Had to impart more power onto the shot if he was to put this away. Couldn't. Kohli's there, and as much as the shoulders might be on struts, he won't drop these. Not when team sense a win here. batsman c Kohli b bowler 1(4)"
1081,"FOUR, what's those feet for? Stays put, just lumbers up and uses the width on this short ball to slice the cut uppishly through backward point. Placed it delicately behind the fielder"
1082,"SIX, bowler is letting it through like a sieve here. Very full ball. Too full, bowler. And McCullum makes room and hedgehops him flat over his head. 39 off bowler's 3 overs so far"
1083,"FOUR, the line was quite similar again. Angled across tight on off-stump but batsman goes for the pull this time. Was prepared on the back foot and swatted it away round the corner, with a deliciously awkward swivel"
1084,"SIX, here's it, again. A big front foot stride that somehow opens the leg-side for this man. Hacks the ball across and popped it away over square leg. Scratch that. Not popped, but bruted"
1085,"out Caught by Milne!! bowler, bowler, bowler! And he gets McCullum on a day he had blown his side away ten years back. Had bowled a similar full ball earlier in the over to McCullum, but the batsman had resisted then. Not this time. It's McCullum. Gujarat need 77 off 33, so he takes this on. Tries the slog-sweep, fails to get under the ball and offers a steepler to deep mid-wicket. Milne there, who catches it, doing a much better job than he did with the ball earlier. batsman c Milne b bowler 72(44) [4s-2 6s-7]"
1086,"SIX, uh oh. I will. I have. Kishan gets a six here. Wanted to do this since the first ball of this over but gets the desired length and pace on this ball. Outside off, just short enough and he's slogged this over deep mid-wicket"
1087,"SIX, I-am-from-McCullum's-team slog sweep. Sits low, gets under this hospitably full ball and punishes it. Admonishes it"
1088,"out batsman Run Out!! 1 run completed. A run out so bad that they are checking which batsman is out. Both are at the same end and the umpires have to decide who's made it back in. batsman drags it down to long-on, gets to the other end and chaos takes over then. Ishan runs back for the second, batsman was unsure about it. Intended. Then not. Then again. But hey, Ishan is at your end. You better get back in. But he's ball-watching and Ishan edge-crosses him at the bowler's end, getting past the marker line quicker. Keeper Kedar Jadhav takes the bails off. Had so much time there, with both the batsman fighting it out at the other end. batsman run out (Negi/Kedar Jadhav) 23(22) [4s-2]"
1089,"2 runs, dropped at long-on. Miscues it high and over but it's been dropped there. Fairly simple chance after Kohli runs across and gets the ball on his stuck out palm as well. Only for it to pop out"
1090,"FOUR, Kohli drops a tough chance here, now, now, he better not hurt his shoulder here. That right one is still sore, we all know. Miscues to deep mid-wicket, Virat Kohli hops back to take it, jumps just in time but tips the ball through. Umpires check if it has touched the ropes as VK looks to recover the ball, and he had"
1091,"FOUR, he has to hit them out now. Sees the width and slashes it through backward point."
1092,"SIX, eish! This guy! It's a full toss alright but look at that bat swing. Brutal. Swings this full toss over deep mid-wicket. Way over. 32 off 8 needed.."
1093,"SIX, 26 needed off the last over now. I'm not calling this, yet. Another slower delivery on the shorter side, Kishan ducks but only to get under it and hoicks it up and over backward square leg"
1094,"out Caught by Chahal!! Umm, who's surprised. 23 off 3 needed, why not hit a few sixes. Throws his bat at a wide back of a length delivery but slices it up in the air, for extra cover to grab hold of it on the edge of the ring. Kohli flashes a thumbs up. Why not. batsman c Chahal b bowler 39(16) [4s-2 6s-4]"
1095,"SIX, hoisted. And with sheer timing. A slider this from bowler onto the pads further amplified by a shuffling across batsman, who picks and posts it over the long leg ropes"
1096,"SIX, just when we assumed the earlier flick was good, this one gets even better. Plonks his front leg forward to a pitched up delivery right in the slot and keeps the bat face full in lofting it with all the elegance. Down the ground"
1097,"FOUR, he's turning it on. Makes it 19 off the over courtesy a walk down and a clip off his legs. Another loss in the radar here from bowler darting it down leg. batsman's ain't complaining though. Just strolls and piles on the misery with a wristy airy flick in front of square"
1098,"SIX, the slog mode is on. Oh it better be. Is quickly on a knee with the bat turning into a slogging monster as he swings across the line and goes high and mighty into the cow corner stands"
1099,"FOUR, the slogs continue. This time off batsman's bat. Walks himself into the line, sees the defensive trajectory on the pads and just whips it off an angled blade. A bounce into the fence behind square"
1100,"out Caught by Watson!! The momentum lets him down. In the quest of continuing with the scoring, he gallops down the track. bowler meanwhile bangs it in half way down the track and gets it to turn in sharply as well. A compulsive heave this off the body gets the inside half of the bat and finds short fine leg. A breeze of a knock clipped. batsman c Watson b bowler 23(8) [4s-2 6s-2]"
1101,"SIX, moves well across the stumps. And is down on a knee. To execute some more of his slogs. An angry sweep in the air and a dispatch into the stands behind square"
1102,"FOUR, a nothing length this. Too short. Sitting up nicely on the bat. And plundered back into the mid-wicket fence with a flat batted opened up pull"
1103,"SIX, brings the hoick out. The defence was meant only for the first delivery. Spots the googly and decides to let the mid-wicket ropes take the brunt of the hammer once again. Tantalizingly over the fingers of a leaping man right at the fence"
1104,"FOUR, a real sitter. Tries the surprise slower one dishing this one out at 117kph and just a tickle off the bottom of batsman's wood on the pull is enough to take it into the gap behind square and past the reach of the man running across"
1105,"SIX, oh the bats. And the muscles. Helped by bowler's want to bowl length and he just gives himself some room in swinging his bat as he lofts it high and mighty down the ground"
1106,"FOUR, a full toss now. With all the men inside the circle at mid-off, even a miscue catching the toe-end of the bat in the extravagant drive means a boundary"
1107,"SIX, nothing mistimed about this one. Hands with a speed greater than 3 x 10^8 as he unleashes a ferocious cut to a short one in slapping it over extra cover. All the way as well"
1108,"FOUR, the leakage goes up to 17. bowler keeps digging it short, the pitch doesn't get it up and batsman keeps raking in the boundaries. Is as usual away on the charge, and the bat transforms into a sword as he stabs it in the air. Over point and guess where it goes"
1109,"SIX, 10 years down. And McCullum puts up another show. Against the very same opponents. A real drag down and pulls out the agricultural heave in pocketing a half-century with a max over his favoured square leg"
1110,"out Stumped!! This is what flight can do to you. bowler realizes it after being tonked around for a few. Slows it up, gives it a lot of air and invites batsman to take it on. batsman in his tentative reach outs looks to search for a feel of the turn. Only for the ball to drift away, bounce and go away past the outside edge for the keeper to do his bit. Yep, the back leg is way out. batsman st Kedar Jadhav b bowler 19(15) [4s-2 6s-1]"
1111,"FOUR, was that intentional from batsman? I don't think so. Where's the slip. In that nagging line outside off where batsman is susceptible early in his innings. batsman looks to dab it towards third man and gets an outside edge that flies past the diving keeper"
1112,"FOUR, 143kph sharp bouncer that hurries onto the batsman. batsman persists with his pull shot and gets a top edge that goes over the short fine leg fielder's head. Unfair for the bowler"
1113,"SIX, he eats, sleeps and churns out sixes like a mill. Right in the slot for batsman, he won't spare those. Just muscles it flat-batted over long-on"
1114,"SIX, what a strike. Full and in the slot for batsman, he flexes his muscles and smokes it a long way into the long-on stands"
1115,"FOUR, streaky but batsman won't mind one bit. Throws his bat at this off-pace delivery, gets a thickish outside edge that flies past a diving short third man. Ishan Kishan was the fielder who dived to his right but to no avail"
1116,"FOUR, batsman is putting on a show here. Shows finesse this time, opens the bat face to this off-cutter outside off and steers it past point. Races away to the fence"
1117,"out Lbw!! Finally, finally. The show is over. Thampi plays the anti-cupid's role. Totally deserves this wicket. From round the wicket, bowls it full and gets it to curl back in sharply, just an inch short of an yorker. batsman was late to bring his bat down there. Misses it and is pinged on the boot. Right in front of middle and looked dead straightaway. Thampi is chuffed. batsman lbw b bowler 77(38) [4s-5 6s-7]"
1118,"FOUR, abandons the niceties of 1s and 2s and unfurls his strong bottom hand here. Leans forward, extends his hands and cracks the drive through extra cover. Fielder in the deep gave a chase but in vain. Sublime!"
1119,"2 runs, 28th IPL fifty for batsman. Whips it wide of long-on and reaches the landmark"
1120,"SIX, there he goes. High percentage shot. Picked the gap and used his wrists to good effect. Generated enough power to send it over the long-on fence"
1121,"SIX, Koushik is being taken to the dry cleaners today. batsman joins into the act. Gets underneath this one and dumps it over cow corner"
1122,"out Caught by Dwayne Smith!! The slower ball does the trick. Kulkarni gets his first wicket and prises out the big fish. Robs off all pace and hurls it on off, batsman swung hard but had to generate some power to clear the fence. In the end, he sends it as far as deep mid-wicket, where Smith was waiting to snaffle that. Easy peasy for the West Indian. batsman c Dwayne Smith b bowler 64(50) [4s-7 6s-1]"
1123,"FOUR, how cheeky from Jadhav? Sees the full ball outside off, waits in his crease and lets his hands take over. Opens his bat face and dinks it in the pocket between short third man and point"
1124,"FOUR, too predictable. The slower ones, I meant. This was on shortish length outside off, batsman deals it with alacrity, fetches the pull from outside off and nails it in front of square"
1125,"FOUR, batsman is cutting loose here. Gets under this full ball outside off and thumps it over extra cover"
1126,"SIX, the pocket-rocket launches his missile. Saw what was coming maybe, picks the knuckle ball by advancing down the track and deposits over long-on"
1127,"FOUR, 10 off first two. fabulous shot. Sets up a solid base, extends his arms and lifts it over extra cover"
1128,"FOUR, drops it short and pays the price. Jadhav takes a step forward, takes on this short ball and short-arm pulls it over square leg. One bounce and over the fence"
1129,"2 runs, dropped. Hard chance though since he was in his followthrough. Looked like the knuckle ball, Jadhav played it too early, gets a leading edge that popped back to Tye, who leapt with both hands outstretched. Can't cling onto the offering. Parries it towards long-off and they will steal a brace"
1130,"FOUR, 200-up for team. Magnificent shot from Jadhav. Engineers room by backing away to leg and lifts it over cover-point. The ball has enough legs to reach the fence"
1131,"SIX, oh dear! bowler fails to get his landing right and bowls it in the arc for Jadhav. Gets dumped over long-on, effortless from Jadhav"
1132,"FOUR, goes the round-armish way but dishes out it outside off, Jadhav lunges across and lofts it over cover. Sort of played a short-arm jab there"
1133,"FOUR, shot! This should amplify his confidence. Steps out of his crease and swishes it away through mid-wicket"
1134,"FOUR, four more! You don't bowl to this guy on his pads. He will keep punishing you. A wristy clip through square leg. Off the middle of the bat and the ball races away"
1135,"FOUR, all timing! A gentle push-drive down the ground. Gets it between the bowler and the mid-off fielder. No chance for either of them"
1136,"1 run, 10,000 runs in T20 cricket for batsman! Full, pacy delivery outside off, batsman throws his horizontal blade at it and the ball runs down to third man off the outside part of the bat"
1137,"SIX, first six of the evening. batsman is underway. A high full toss served to him and batsman just about manages to put it away. He lofts it over mid-off. Didn't get it off the middle, but doesn't matter as it had enough wings to hit the boundary rope on the full"
1138,"FOUR, fired in quick outside off, lots of width on offer. batsman treks back and punishes it with a punch. The mid-off fielder dived and got a hand to it. But the power off batsman's bat ensured it crossed the rope"
1139,"SIX, there you go! Overpitched and batsman latches onto it. Presses forward and dispatches it over long-off for a huge six. Just an extension of his off-drive. Brings up the 50-run stand as well"
1140,"FOUR, now he finds the gap. Similar delivery, batsman thumps it between the bowler and Kohli. The ball bullets away"
1141,"FOUR, four more. bowler darts it outside off, batsman crouches low and bludgeons it over extra cover. No chance for the men in the deep"
1142,"SIX, oh hello! The best of the lot. Gets down on one knee and slog sweeps this firing in fullish ball into the deep mid-wicket stands"
1143,"SIX, bowler gets his man. But, this wicket should belong to McCullum. Hang on! It was a low full toss outside off. batsman stays in his crease and doesn't get hold of his lofted drive over extra cover. B-Mac at long-off runs to his right and takes a flying one-handed catch. The Lions are confident. The umpires want to go upstairs. Soft signal is Out. Oh wait, did his floppy hat make contact with the rope? Oh, yeah. What a shame! Baz's brim of the hat saves Chris batsman. The southpaw has a big smile on his face as he comes back. He gets six runs as well. Even, Kohli came and shook hands with the SUPERMAN to applaud his effort. Credit to McCullum for he immediately gestured that his hat may have touched the hoarding. Felt the touching motion"
1144,"FOUR, team are going well here. batsman talked about intent after their loss against team. He and Gayle are showing it. Bouncer, batsman walks across and pulls it very fine. The fine leg fielder was very fine and he had no chance there"
1145,"SIX, stand and deliver. That's a 104 meter six! Gets to his fifty in a grand style. Right in the slot for batsman to swing his bat. Sees the width outside off, comes forward and blasts it over long-on. The ball is out of the stadium. New balls please. He takes some piece of the sand from the turf and pours it on his bat"
1146,"FOUR, leading edge for four. The ball just eluded Yuvraj's reach at backward point as he dived to his left. There was just enough nibble for bowler as batsman closed his bat-face too early. But he timed the edge wonderfully, if that's a thing"
1147,"FOUR, oh spanked! Pressure on the debutant straightaway. Two fours out of two. He goes short this time and batsman absolutely slaughters him on the front foot. Rockets away through mid-wicket"
1148,"FOUR, whipped away. Poor ball on leg-stump and batsman times his flick beautifully through mid-wicket. It was hit uppishly but he found the gap pretty well"
1149,"out Caught by Deepak Hooda!! Uppish flick again, and taken. It was almost the exact same ball like the previous one and was there for batsman to dispatch to the boundary. But he finds the fielder at mid-wicket this time. He's gutted with himself. More importantly, a big confidence booster for bowler. batsman c Deepak Hooda b bowler 13(9) [4s-3]"
1150,"FOUR, 138ks, Iyer thanks him for the pace. Bowled short and in the zone to be ramping it away with an open bat face, times it ever so sweetly does batsman"
1151,"out Caught by Henriques!! And they lose a wicket first ball, good running catch from Henriques at extra cover. Robs the pace does Mohammed bowler and dishes it wide of off, asking batsman to fetch. He fell for the trap looking to clear the ring, slices the stroke off the bottom half, the bat face turns on impact too. Henriques doesn't drop many, does he? batsman c Henriques b bowler 42(33) [4s-3 6s-2]"
1152,"FOUR, exposes all his stumps as he backs away, standing far outside leg-stump. bowler follows him but doesn't bowl it as close as he would have liked, Iyer cashes on the width and flays it away over point for a once-bounce four"
1153,"SIX, advances, right to the pitch of the ball and he smokes it for a maximum over long-off"
1154,"SIX, down the pitch again, just a clean swing of the willow. Might have read the wrong 'un early, and then used all his might to get the distance, into the stands over mid-wicket"
1155,"FOUR, saw the field and preempted the scoopy flick over short fine, got good connection and posted it in the gap. Deep backward square can't get there"
1156,"FOUR, innovative and effective from Iyer. Crouches as he stands outside leg-stump, Bhuvi does well to follow him, but Iyer uses the pace to slice the cut over short third man. Just that subtle adjustment of the bat face..."
1157,"FOUR, right in the crash-bang-wallop zone, batsman clears his front leg and takes him for a tour over mid-wicket. Once bounce and over the ropes"
1158,"FOUR, full toss on the pads, Iyer helps it away to the left of fine leg. Dhawan tried his best running a few yards across the boundary triangles, but that was timed too well"
1159,"FOUR, brilliant from Iyer. That shot has been nipped out from Kohli's locker. Stands deep inside the crease and just opens the bat face to send the yorker between backward point and short third man"
1160,"SIX, can't get away this time. Another full toss in the swinging zone, batsman clears his front leg and smites it over wide long-on"
1161,"out Caught by (sub)Jordan!! Takes on a slower short ball, pulls...no timing. Straight down the throat of Chris Jordan at wide long-on. batsman c (sub)Jordan b bowler 31(23) [4s-2 6s-1]"
1162,"FOUR, back of a length delivery outside off, batsman firmly punches it through point. Lovely balance at the crease there. Didn't try to do something fancy. Just a proper cricket shot"
1163,"FOUR, oh lovely shot. What hand-eye coordination! His feet didn't move a great deal as he creamed the length ball on the up through cover-point"
1164,"1 run, a tame flat-drive through cover to get to his fifty, but that won't help. 4/4 wins for team at home, yet again their bowling comes to the rescue. Superb death bowling"
1165,"SIX, lofts him into the stands. What a way to get off the mark. Right in the slot from Kaul, and batsman goes through with an uninhibited swing over long-on"
1166,"SIX, another nonchalant strike over long-on! He makes it look ridiculously easy. The key is that batsman's head is so still while hitting through the line. Once the ball is full, he simply gets a small stride in, keeps his balance, and plays an extension of the on-drive"
1167,"FOUR, squeezes it through the ring. Full and wide ball, batsman plants his foot across and unfurls a drive through the covers. It didn't look like he get all of the timing, but on this outfield it's enough"
1168,"FOUR, top-edged over short fine leg. Unlucky bowler. He's rushed batsman on the pull again and he's not in any control whatsoever"
1169,"FOUR, drifts it in on leg, it's half-edged, half-deliberate. batsman played slightly outside the line expecting the ball to turn a bit too more but it skids on"
1170,"FOUR, that's a shot which can eliminate the hassle of picking the turn. As soon as Rashid drifts it close to the stumps, batsman is down on the crease for the sweep and he slaps this nicely through mid-wicket"
1171,"FOUR, that will run away. Slightly straight from bowler and batsman has picked him away so easily. The faintest of tickles to get it past the wicketkeeper. He's looking good again"
1172,"SIX, brilliant shot on the move. He's walking down the pitch, bowler does him in length with an off-cutter but batsman is still able to loft him through the line over mid-off. He not only clears the infield, but the timing ensures that he clears the boundary too"
1173,"FOUR, what an interesting choice of bowler at this stage. bowler for the first time in this tournament, and he's been spanked off the first ball. Short outside off, batsman slaps him hard through point"
1174,"out Nair Run Out!! 1 run completed. That's such an unfortunate way for this partnership to end. A run out. But what a timely breakthrough for the home team. The ball is nudged into the vacant mid-wicket region from batsman who wants two. They're both running hard from the get-go, so there's not any hesitation there. But what an effort from Vijay Shankar running in from the boundary. He swoops in quickly and fires a brilliant throw on the bounce right beside the stumps. Nair run out (Vijay Shankar/bowler) 33(23) [4s-5 6s-1]"
1175,"out Caught by Warner!! bowler gets batsman. Oh that's such a big wicket. batsman was striking them brilliantly in the last game, and to get him first ball is massive. Should he have taken a bit more time rather than going for the slog first ball? You could argue. But that's how he's been playing so far. bowler does well to get it slightly wide of off and batsman has to reach out for the slog-sweep. He wants to drag this over mid-wicket, but ends up miscuing to long-on. batsman c Warner b bowler 0(1)"
1176,"FOUR, swings hard and gets a boundary. Poor delivery as well from Yadav. A short ball, batsman slightly crouches and swishes it through mid-wicket. There is no protection there and batsman is away"
1177,"1 run, direct hit would have made things interesting. Pitched up delivery outside off, batsman pushes to mid-off and sets off. He puts in a dive. But had Jayant Yadav found the target, batsman would have been a goner"
1178,"out Caught by Mishra!! Big wicket for DD. How many times have we seen batsman get out like this? He was dismissed at least thrice in this manner in the previous Ashes. Short ball at a good pace - close to 145kph. batsman is caught in two minds - to go hard on his pull or just tap it on the on-side. In the end, he brings his bat down a bit late and the ball lobs up off the leading edge. Mishra, from short fine leg, runs forward and gobbles it up. batsman c Mishra b bowler 4(7)"
1179,"SIX, fine shot! Short delivery around off, batsman was on the front foot, but quickly transfered his weight back and pulled it behind square. There was a fielder in the deep, but placed it well wide of him"
1180,"2 runs, fifty for batsman. First game and he's already making an impact. Whichever format it is just pleasing to watch KW bat. Moves away to the leg-side, reads the googly off the surface and works it in the gap in front of square on the leg-side, sprints back for the second and raises his bat to acknowledge the applause"
1181,"FOUR, up and over Cummins. Quicker the delivery and batsman is so much more comfortable. Low full toss outside off, batsman walks across and tonks it over the bowler. No chance for long-on or long-off"
1182,"FOUR, rubbish from bowler and batsman deals with it. Darted full and down leg, batsman crouches low and helps it along the way past short fine. 100-run stand comes up with that boundary"
1183,"SIX, even the tallest man in the team can't get a finger on that. Tossed up around off, batsman makes room and drags the loft towards long-on. Morris was a few yards inside the rope and the ball sailed over his leap. If he had been on the edge, who knows"
1184,"SIX, how is he not playing every game? He's turning it on here for team. Just a bit of air from bowler, batsman kneels down and nails the slog sweep to perfection, flat and over cow corner. BTW, it is his fifth six of the evening"
1185,"FOUR, buckle up folks this is going to be some contest. Zak with his funky fields and batsman trying to bisect them. Full and on off, almost a yorker length, batsman moves across and whips it over backward square. The fielder was inside the ring and he was nowhere near the ball"
1186,"1 run, fifty for batsman. His first of the season. After a couple of 40s, he finally has a half-century to his name. That should bring back the confidence in him. Williamson walks up and congratulates him on the milestone. The knuckle ball which is short in length, batsman is early into the pull and lobs it off the edge to fine leg"
1187,"FOUR, this is batting of the highest order. The cross-seamer on a fuller length outside off, batsman takes a step across and lofts it inside out through extra cover. Iyer at sweeper had no chance. The placement was equisite"
1188,"FOUR, batsman has certainly enjoyed batting against bowler. Slower short ball, batsman makes room and slaps the pull in front of square, bisecting deep mid-wicket and long-on"
1189,"out Caught by Shreyas Iyer!! Needed something special to get rid of batsman and Iyer has pulled off a stunner. Dhawan pats the Kiwi on the back as he trudges off. It has been a high quality innings from batsman. First opportunity and he's grabbed it with both hands. Good length ball on off, batsman maintains a low base to hoick it into the leg-side, gets more of a leading edge towards deep mid-wicket. Iyer from deep square leg covers good ground, dives full length and clings on. Made it look easy did the Mumbaikar. batsman c Shreyas Iyer b bowler 89(51) [4s-6 6s-5]"
1190,"FOUR, batsman takes over the mantle. Short of a length delivery, batsman swivels and pulls it over the leaping backward square fielder. Just about eluded Mathews there"
1191,"no run, direct hit and Yuvraj would have had a diamond duck to his name. Very full and on leg-stump, batsman misses the flick and is rapped on the pads, the ball rolls to the left of Morris and Yuvraj was backing up for the run. batsman sends him back and Morris fires a throw which is off-target"
1192,"FOUR, streaky and batsman won't mind. Morris looks down in frustration. Deceived batsman with a slower delivery and the opener just threw his hands at that, the outside edge evades the outstretched left hand of Pant"
1193,"SIX, geez! That ball hardly left the surface. A flat six from batsman. bowler missed the yorker by a good couple of inches, batsman got underneath it and heaved it over deep mid-wicket. bowler leaking plenty"
1194,"out Caught by Mathews!! Third wicket for Morris. Not his best of deliveries, but he wouldn't mind as it takes his wicket tally into double digits. Short of length and on leg-stump, batsman premeditated and got inside the line, he gets the pull off the cue-end and Mathews at deep backward square made no mistake. batsman c Mathews b bowler 70(50) [4s-7 6s-1]"
1195,"out Bowled!! Top nut! Morris doing the damage for team in the death overs. This is a big wicket, with couple of overs to go, batsman would have unleashed himself. A yorker aimed for the base of leg-stump, batsman attempts to flick, gets his legs inside the line and allows the ball to slip past him, crashes into the leg-pole. He's on a hat-trick as well. batsman b bowler 3(4)"
1196,"SIX, crack! That was the sound when ball made contact with the bat. A gift from bowler and Hooda takes full toll, full toss on the pads, Hooda swings hard and dispatches it over deep square leg"
1197,"FOUR, charges down and even though bowler digs it in short, batsman pulls with a full pivot of the front leg, split deep mid-wicket and deep square leg to perfection"
1198,"FOUR, bowler wanted the yorker, but instead offers a full delivery, batsman lofts it straight back down the ground, no chance for the man at long-off to cut that off"
1199,"FOUR, class written all over that shot. Seam-up delivery from a short of length. Width on offer as well. batsman waits for the ball on the back foot and cuts it behind backward point. No chance for third man"
1200,"FOUR, Morris is trying too much here. Bangs it in short and offers ample width outside off for batsman to free his arms. batsman jumps and elevates it over point. It came right off the middle of the bat"
1201,"FOUR, shot! That was bowled at 143kph. Short of a good length delivery outside off, batsman gets on top of it and caresses it between mid-off and extra cover. No need to run for shots like that"
1202,"SIX, length ball at 123kph. batsman trusts the bounce, gets into a good position and dispatches it over mid-wicket. Off the sweet spot of the bat"
1203,"SIX, even better! batsman is looking in fine touch here. Shimmies down the ground and lofts it over long-off. Exquisite timing. He didn't try to hit the ball hard. Relied on timing"
1204,"FOUR, Cummins comes round the wicket and bangs it in short. batsman slightly moves across and goes with his pull shot. He wasn't under control, but got enough wood on it to send it wide of the keeper. The boundary also brings up the 50-run stand"
1205,"FOUR, cheeky and effective! batsman anticipated where bowler would bowl and moved across the crease well before the ball was released. Uses the pace on this delivery and laps it over short fine leg. A couple of bounces into the fence"
1206,"FOUR, and Marsh is off the mark with a boundary. Poor delivery from Pandya, maybe he was trying to bowl the inswinger from just outside off stump but lost control and delivered a ball that was short and wide, easy cut shot through cover-point"
1207,"FOUR, was that another chance? Looked like Nitish Rana got a fingertip to it and would be called a dropped chance. Fullish and angled across outside off stump, batsman squre-drives on the rise, the man at backward point moved to his left and tried to reverse-cup the ball but couldn't hold on"
1208,"SIX, why is Pollard not at long-on? The only man who could have had a chance, but this would have cleared him as well. Currently, it is Nitish Rana who is patrolling the fence. Flatter delivery on the leg stump, batsman lofts over the top and clears the long-on boundary"
1209,"out Bowled!! batsman never looked comfortable against bowler. Looks to loft over long-on, Pandya spots his intentions and held his length back slightly, it drifts in slowly with great amount of dip to slide and slip into the leg peg. Brilliant work. batsman b bowler 11(15)"
1210,"FOUR, slower ball, batsman shows his class. Shuffles forward and towards the delivery and opens the bat face to slice it behind point. Pure timing"
1211,"FOUR, just a mere extension of the punch. Played it with leaden-feet and timed it to perfection, waited for the full ball to dip and graced it with touch of elegance. Back over the bowler's head for a one-bounce four"
1212,"1 run, slower and wider, batsman had to fetch, pings a single to cover to celebrate his fifty. Job half-done, his team-mates are a happy bunch in the dugout"
1213,"FOUR, cuts and cuts well does Hashim batsman. Stays deep inside the crease and rotates his wrists through a fierce cut, beating a diving backward point to his right"
1214,"FOUR, pacy bouncer and batsman isn't holding back this time. Wields his willow through a fiery pull and top-edges it over the keeper's head"
1215,"FOUR, that's brutalized behind square on the off-side. That bouncer might have just woken him up. Clears his front leg, waits for the length ball to arrive and smashes it with the amount of power only MAXI can generate. Those Popeye arms..woof!"
1216,"SIX, Maxi has arrived. ""The juices are flowing for Glenn batsman,"" Mike Hussey on air is all excited. Gets underneath a full delivery and sends it soaring into the stands over long-on"
1217,"SIX, D-I-S-M-I-S-S-I-V-E! No change of length, in the slot and batsman whangs it like a fire-cracker over long-off"
1218,"FOUR, emergency, emergency! The bowlers are being thrashed, someone send an ambulance. Maxi is putting up a clinic. This is some batting. bowler bowls it straight, marmalized wide of long-on"
1219,"SIX, full toss again, you gotta be kidding me. batsman uses every ounce of his muscular stamina to whip-loft it into mars. Bam!"
1220,"no ball, FOUR, front foot no-ball and bang! batsman whups a full toss with over a leaping backward point"
1221,"SIX, that has gone out of the stadium. Things that T20 cricket do, Hashim batsman can hit the long ball. What's more amazing is the power he generated behind the shot, batsman picks the change of pace and spank-banged it over the top-tier over long-off with a bat velocity of 135KPH"
1222,"SIX, 72 metres maximum square on the off-side. Well, well! batsman is nailing it. He is treating bowler like a club bowler, hammers him with a throw of the kitch sink on the off-side"
1223,"FOUR, bludgeoned straight down the ground, don't bother looking back Mr Slinga-bowler"
1224,"FOUR, full toss on leg-stump, batsman helps it on its way with a flick of his wrists. So easily done. 50 runs from the last 2 overs"
1225,"out Bowled!! My fingers became numb, so did the atmosphere around the office and in Indore too. Lack of pace foxes batsman. He picked it late and was through the shot early, the ball cut back in before deflecting off his pads onto the stumps. An absolute gem of a knock from the BigShow. batsman b bowler 40(18) [4s-4 6s-3]"
1226,"out Caught by Pollard!! Slower ball again and batsman holes out to long-on. Clears his front leg and looks to tonk it into the stands, doesn't get the distance, off the cue end of the bat and straight into the ever-safe hands of KP. batsman c Pollard b bowler 1(3)"
1227,"FOUR, room on offer and batsman uses it to great effect. Carves the short ball over point giving no chance for sweeper cover to cut it off. batsman on fire, just 17 away from the triple treat"
1228,"FOUR, across his stumps and way she goes into the fine leg fence. Sweetly timed, bowler has no clue. batsman walked a long way across and helped the full delivery with a real tap of the bat. Flew!"
1229,"SIX, short ball, batsman clatters the pull off the top-edge, over the keeper's head but who cares? It's a six"
1230,SIX. First T20 hundred for Hashim batsman. What.A.Player. He posts a leg-side rubbish into the fine leg stands with a clean wallop. Sigh!
1231,"FOUR, that's an excellent shot from Marsh. Shortish and rising high, Marsh stood tall and cut it away over point, didn't bother to keep the ball down and it raced to the fence in no time"
1232,"FOUR, this time he cuts along the ground, the length wasn't all that shorter compared to the previous ball, Marsh timed that shot sweetly as well and pierced the gap between cover-point and cover"
1233,"FOUR, that's asking for trouble. Short and way outside off stump, the arm-ball gone wrong, maybe the newish ball slipped out of his hands, Marsh had to reach out and he cut that fiercely past point"
1234,"SIX, wowww! It's always interesting to see batsman play aggressive cricket. This was an authoritative hit. bowler seemed surprise by that approach. He bowled a normal back of a length delivery, but batsman had made up his mind to go big, went back in the crease and launched it over long-on for the first maximum of the day"
1235,"FOUR, the slower ball doesn't stick on the surface and sits up nicely for Marsh to thrash that away for four with a pull shot. Hit with some power and the man in the deep had no chance"
1236,"out Caught by Pollard!! Oopsy! Marsh is out against the run of play. Certainly not a great delivery, could have been easily put away, but as luck would have it, the bat turned in Marsh's hands and brought about his downfall. Number one down for Punjab after a brisk 46-run opening stand. This was a full ball, Marsh wanted the flick again having missed out off the third bal of the over, but he totally mistimed it and offered a simple catch to Pollard at mid-wicket. batsman c Pollard b bowler 26(21) [4s-5]"
1237,"SIX, easy as! That's just a flick off the wrists and the ball has flown away over mid-wicket. A little shimmy down the pitch from batsman to get close to the ball, picks it away with sumptuous timing. He's been lukewarm so far in the IPL. Can tonight be the night?"
1238,"FOUR, steers the ball through point for four. Good length ball outside off, batsman's feet don't move a lot as he opens the bat-face and guides the ball in the gap. The timing stands out again"
1239,"FOUR, stand and admire! That's a scorching drive. Wow. That's not a half-volley, not even close. But Parthiv still manages to blaze it away on the up. He hit that uppishly but found the gap"
1240,"SIX, we're into the mode of having fun now. A wide yorker gone wrong. Shortened by a few inches and Rana just leans low, crouches and whacks it down the ground"
1241,"1 run, 140kph, and sliced away even faster. Keeps it wide making batsman stretch every cell of his body in getting close. Does with a square stab. Brings up the 50 between the duo as well"
1242,"SIX, right in the slot. Talk of the pressure of a chase. Mumbai do not seem to understand though. Sinks, buries and slogs it into the night sky. Rows into the cow corner stands"
1243,"SIX, the misery is piled on. This time with the length getting even more horrific. In the form of a rank drag down. A rock back, a swivel and a dispatch off a flat batted mow into the mid-wicket stands"
1244,"SIX, whoa. Brute. Angry. These bottom hands. These big bats. All in one. Clears his front leg getting it out of the way does batsman, gets under the friendly length delivery and just jabs it over long-off. The flattest you'd have seen"
1245,"SIX, a miscue? Does it matter? It continues to fly. More of the sitters from Sandeep enabling batsman to get on top of the bounce and he just clobbers it over cow corner. The required run-rate is a mockery now"
1246,out Caught by Maxwell!! The misery closes. The carnage is over. Looks for another tonk down the ground in looking to finish this off in a hurry. Just that the bat handle rolls in his palms for a change and the ball doesn't get the distance. A miscued slice flies high up and falls into the palms of mid-off. A knock for the centuries nevertheless. batsman c Maxwell b bowler 77(37) [4s-7 6s-5]
1247,"SIX, 180-degrees on the other side from the one he'd intended to go over. But the maximums only keep coming. Gets the ball to climb up awkwardly does bowler getting it up on the ribs and Rana just swings his bat looking to go over cow corner again with the familiar hits. Gets the familiar result though with the top-edge flying over the cordon. And his third half-century of this season too"
1248,"SIX, another bat. Another rocket launcher. The angry flat bat face is up and so is the usage in whacking it. Boom. Back into the third stand. Over mid-wicket"
1249,"FOUR, a low full toss. bowler well and truly on his way to some unwanted bowling figures tonight. Pandya meanwhile just about clears his front leg and slices it past a tired extra cover at the fence. Spare a thought"
1250,"FOUR, and again. bowler has 58 against his name. A full delivery hoping to veer into the blockhole and Pandya digs it out with the bat gaining all the momentum to be imparted with a smash past the bowler. Long-off doesn't even want to take the effort in chasing this. Futile I tell you"
1251,"SIX, that's that. A real mockery this. A target of almost 200 and Mumbai do it with time to spare to go after another. Mohit meanwhile bends his back in banging it half way down the track and Rana just swivels as he hooks it into the second floor. Over long leg"
1252,"FOUR, with the keeper up, batsman doesn't give the charge. What he does is back away to make room and laces a drive off the stumps through extra-cover. Sandeep had overpitched there and gets drilled to the boundary"
1253,"SIX, oh my! team won't be liking this. They don't want to run into batsman on the wrong night. And so far, the signs are ominous. batsman exposes his stumps again, backs away, and smokes a low full toss over extra-cover. Flat six"
1254,"SIX, good length ball on leg stump, Parthiv whips it gloriously into the fine leg stands. What a pick up! The runs are flowing for Mumbai"
1255,"FOUR, oh dear, is Miller okay? That burst through his hands and hit him on the head. Luckily, it looks like just a glancing blow. The good length ball was hit ferociously by batsman and it flew towards extra-cover. Would have taken some catching but Miller would normally back himself"
1256,"FOUR, wrong lines from bowler, and Parthiv will pick him away from there all day everday. Fullish on the pads, he's been flicked away behind square"
1257,"FOUR, there's no stopping the boundaries. Mohit bangs it in first ball and he's been ramped over the keeper's head. What a start for Mumbai. They're absolutely flying"
1258,"FOUR, picks the slower ball and thumps it through extra-cover. Carnage in Indore. It was a back of length off-cutter and somehow batsman managed to infuse enough power on the drive off the back foot"
1259,"FOUR, drifts into the pads, and with fine leg up, that's asking for punishment. batsman duly puts him away to the boundary. Good wristwork"
1260,"FOUR, 17 off the first over from Mohit. I think Maxwell will have to turn to spin. His pacers are disappearing. Slower ball outside off, it's full and in the slot, and batsman nails him through extra-cover again"
1261,"SIX, backs away, bowler bangs it in, and Parthiv spanks him off the front foot well in front of square. That's gone all the way. It's just flying off their bats. Amazing timing"
1262,"FOUR, that's a sizzler! He's absolutely scythed that through point. A little bit of width from bowler, Parthiv adds to it by making some room and slashes it away"
1263,"out Caught by Maxwell!! Pace off the ball gets Parthiv. It's an off-cutter bowled on a back of length outside off, Parthiv tries to flat-bat it down the ground but he's not in control of the shot and slices it up in the air to mid-off. Relief for Punjab. batsman c Maxwell b bowler 37(18) [4s-4 6s-2]"
1264,"SIX, any confirmation needed about what form Rana has been in? Have a look at this. He's pulled that into the stands, making it look so easy. Short of length over leg-stump, that's usually a very awkward line. But Rana's so quick to get outside the line of it and then helps it on its way over fine leg"
1265,"FOUR, sliced in the air, the bat turned on impact there. But batsman will still get four. He can't do much wrong tonight. Backs away a touch to what was probably a slower ball and is able to place it wide of long-off, the ball turning away from the fielder further after bouncing"
1266,"1 run, slid in from round the wicket, batsman jabs it to the right of long-on and brings up his half-century. Mumbai will hope that this knock gets his season going"
1267,"SIX, bowler fires this well outside off and would have hoped that he's got this out of Rana's reach. But Rana is still able to fetch the slog-sweep comfortably over wide long-on. Amazing shot"
1268,"SIX, that's almost a seam-up delivery from bowler, but he's landed it way too short and batsman parks him into the crowd. He uses the depth of the crease well and pulls it over mid-wicket"
1269,"FOUR, McCullum is underway! bowler fires it in full on middle, McCullum drills it down the ground. The umpire has to duck under it to evade that. The ball races away into the fence"
1270,"FOUR, offers bit of width outside off and McCullum latches onto it. Treks back in his crease and fiercely cuts through covers. Good start for team"
1271,"FOUR, shot! Trademark batsman shot. Seam-up delivery wide of off, batsman manufactures more room by backing away. Lifts it inside-out over the cover region"
1272,"SIX, wow! The intention is clear from both batsmen. Slightly overpitched, batsman gets low and smacks the slog sweep over deep mid-wicket. There was a man in the deep, but he couldn't do anything"
1273,"FOUR, gets into a picturesque position as he loft-drives bowler over extra cover. On one knee mind you, sweetly timed and in the gap as well"
1274,"FOUR, is quick to jummp onto the back foot, gets inside the line of the flatter delivery and thumps it with a clean swing of the willow. A boundary behind square on the leg-side"
1275,"FOUR, deft! batsman camps deep inside the crease and steers the ball with softest of touches as he opens the bat face at the right moment. Needed a dive from Narine at short third man, he is just lazing around"
1276,"out Caught by U Yadav!! And this is what [Most] players do when they don't have a clue of which way the ball is turning. batsman belongs to the same genre, or at least, looked like so. Crouches and looks to break the shackles with a slog-sweep, poor connection, Umesh Yadav takes a well-judged catch at deep backward square. batsman c U Yadav b bowler 4(11)"
1277,FOUR. No sighters. Walk in and get a boundary. As simple as that. Slog-sweeps from outside off and boy! The ball flies away
1278,"out Bowled!! Makes a mess of batsman's stumps does Umesh Yadav. Sheer pace. Steams in and bowls it at full throttle, it was pitched on a fuller length and snapped back in slightly, Smith was late to get his bat down. It grazes a chunk of bottom edge before crashing into the stumps. TIMBAHHHH! batsman b bowler 5(4) [4s-1]"
1279,"FOUR, just a slice of inside edge and through. It skids straight on and nicks the edge before racing past the leg-stump. Tough for Robbie to pick"
1280,"1 run, drives to the right of a diving bowler and marks his fifty"
1281,"SIX, picks the slower ball and deposits into the crowd. An off-cutter from Yadav, batsman backs away and nails the slog sweep from a length. Sailing over mid-wicket"
1282,"FOUR, there's the width which batsman has been eyeing. It's on the shorter side too, and batsman is able to lash it away past backward point. Beats third man to the boundary"
1283,"SIX, top-edged .. and taken by Surya at long-on. But he's stepped on the boundary cushion. Straightaway signals a six, making it easy for the umpire. A desperate move from batsman after three dot balls, he nearly falters but somehow the top-edge flies right at the edge of the boundary, where Surya does really well having stationed himself just inside the ropes. But his weight is leaning back as he stretches overhead and the momentum takes him over"
1284,"FOUR, length ball outside off, batsman moves leg-side and slaps it straight back past the bowler. Mid-off was up inside the ring, and batsman is able to slot it to his left"
1285,"FOUR, he's winning it for his team. Makes some room and nearly slices this overpitched delivery from off-stump. The placement is spot on, so is the timing as he nails this past backward point"
1286,"SIX, slower ball this time, and all the way. He's tearing into bowler here. Picks up the change of pace right off the hand and whips the ball off middle and leg into the deep mid-wicket stands"
1287,"1 run, generously tossed up on off, overpitches, and batsman drills it down to long-on"
1288,"SIX, quickly onto his back knee to smoke a slog-sweep over mid-wicket. He sees the ball drifting into leg, it's in the slot and batsman gets under it beautifully. Just 8 needed now"
1289,"out Caught by M Pandey!! batsman perishes just short of the finish line. It's a flat leg-break outside off, batsman wants to cut but the ball turns away sharply and takes a thick top-edge. It loops up to the left of Pandey at point who takes a really sharp catch diving across. End of a fine knock, and surely a match-winning one. batsman c M Pandey b bowler 84(46) [4s-9 6s-4]"
1290,"FOUR, batsman seals it with a boundary! Short from bowler, enough width for batsman to slap it past backward point. Superb chase from the Gujarat Lions to hopefully provide a boost to their turbulent campaign"
1291,"FOUR, 16 off the over. Short, seam-up delivery outside off, cracking cut well in front of square on the off-side"
1292,"FOUR, wow! He has muscled it. With mid-on inside the cirlce, that's a safe shot. Backs away a tad and tonks this fullish delivery over mid-on"
1293,"FOUR, this is brilliant batting from the Victorian. Sees it in his slot and lifts it handsomely over mid-on"
1294,"SIX, second six for batsman and team are off to a flier. Waits for this slingy ball to come to him and dispatches it into the long-on stands. 15 runs off the over"
1295,"out Caught by M Pandey!! Gone! bowler gets his man. After bowling a slower bouncer, bowler opts for the quicker one this time. batsman is slightly late on his pull as he is hurried by the pace. Gets it off the top portion of the bat. Pandey at deep square leg, settles under it and takes it calmly. batsman c M Pandey b bowler 31(15) [4s-4 6s-2]"
1296,"FOUR, that came right off the middle of the bat. Angling in short of length delivery, McCullum jogs down and leg-side-ish to cut it behind a diving backward point. No chance whatsoever for third man"
1297,"SIX, 50 up for team in 23 balls! Head-high bouncer, McCullum isn't perplexed by that. He is on the front foot to pummel the pull well in front of square on the leg-side. The deep mid-wicket fielder is just a spectator"
1298,"FOUR, 16 off the fourth over. Superb adjustment. Seeing McCullum jogging down, bowler darts it outside off, McCullum spots it slices it backward of point. One bounce into the fence"
1299,"no run, dropped! The odds of this happening are high when you field a non-regular keeper. batsman pokes at a turning off-break and gets an outside edge. Uthappa fails to gobble it up. How costly is that going to be?"
1300,"FOUR, shot! McCullum moves leg-side and bowler follows him and darts it in. McCullum crouches low and smacks it with a sweep through backward square leg"
1301,"out Caught by M Pandey!! Would you believe it? B-Mac has carved one straight down the throat of sweeper cover, Manish Pandey, the man. Didn't even had to move an inch. Gives himself a lot of room and takes on a 140ks full delivery, smacked it off the meat and for a fleeting moment I thought it was a maximum. Not to be. batsman c M Pandey b bowler 33(17) [4s-5 6s-1]"
1302,"FOUR, room on offer and batsman makes the most of it. Adjusted well as he rose high to flay it past a diving backward point"
1303,"out Caught by Gambhir!! Nathan bowler continues to pick wickets. DK reveals his cards a touch too early, seeks to flick into the on-side and sends a leading edge into the off-side. Gambhir lurking at cover anticipates and takes a good catch diving to his left. The ball popped up off his palm, but he hung onto it while falling parallel to the ground. batsman c Gambhir b bowler 3(3)"
1304,"FOUR, quintessential Suresh batsman inside-out loft over extra cover. Anyone surprised? He does this so often and that too off the first ball of the over. Makes room and goes bang off the middle"
1305,"SIX, just grazes Pathan's fingertips at fine leg. Hooks a short ball and wasn't quite in control of it, it loops up and goes flat to the right of fine leg who sprints with his right hand stretched to the maximum. Just can't get there"
1306,"FOUR, that's Daren Sammy alike from Sunil batsman. The former is very good with his whip without moving his feet much and batsman has emulated him. The line is straight on the stumps from PK, batsman stands and flicks stylishly over backward square leg and beats the man at fine leg"
1307,"FOUR, now that's some response from batsman. He knows that the outswinger is troubling him, steps down the pitch and forces the bowler to drop it short, which will not allow the ball to swing, and then he goes back over the bowler's head for a boundary"
1308,"FOUR, he's doing it nicely, Sunil batsman! Just what Gambhir and Co. wanted with the promotion. PK bowls short of length and just outside off stump, batsman waits for the ball to come and hits through the line over mid-on"
1309,"FOUR, bowler sports an ""Ooohhhh,"" with a wry smile on his face. This wasn't a bad delivery. Full and swinging away outside off stump, batsman drives without moving his feet, sends it to the right of mid-off and it races away"
1310,"FOUR, that's edged and no one at slip. bowler delivers one outside off stump, batsman goes hard at it and gets a thick edge that escapes past the keeper"
1311,"FOUR, off the back foot and over mid-off. This is great exhibition of batting from the West Indian. Short of a length just outside off stump, batsman lofts nicely from the middle of the bat and collects his sixth boundary"
1312,"SIX, batsman is the best front foot puller. Picks the back of a length delivery early, just plonks his foot forward and short-arm jabs the pull over cow corner. Flat and all the way"
1313,"FOUR, deft, delicate and effective. The off-cutter outside off, batsman waited for the ball to arrive, cut it late and pierced short third man and backward point to perfection. He couldn't have played that better"
1314,"FOUR, the idea was to steer it to third man, but batsman got it finer than he would have liked. Slower delivery angled across the batsman, batsman gets an edge that eludes Karthik to his right. Should he have gone for the catch? Tough one to call"
1315,"out Caught by Raina!! The partnership has been broken. If you wanted someone from the team team to be under this skier, it would be Raina. Short of a length and on off, batsman went for the pull and the top-edge goes straight up, keeps swirling and almost kisses the night sky before coming down, Raina from mid-wicket, called for it, removed his cap to get a good sighter and then reverse cupped it safely. batsman c Raina b bowler 33(28) [4s-1 6s-1]"
1316,"FOUR, that was just a nudge and the lightning fast Kolkata outfield does the rest. Short of length and on the batsman's hips, Pandey backed away and twirled his wrists to place it wide of short fine leg, once in the gap it was a boundary"
1317,"FOUR, uses the pace of bowler and collects a boundary. Pushed through just outside off, batsman waits and steers it fine. Once past the 30-yard circle, there's no stopping that"
1318,"FOUR, fifty for batsman. Second for him this season. Gets there with a cheeky little scoop. Expects bowler to target the stumps, shuffles across and gets low, then laps it over Karthik to bring up the milestone"
1319,"FOUR, that might be the commentators curse. Thampi missed the yorker by a few yards, low full toss on middle, batsman flicks it to the fine leg fence. The fast outfield on display again"
1320,"FOUR, the ball hits the turf and zips off. McCullum had a few yards to cover and he couldn't get there. Very full and just outside off, batsman lofts it wide of long-off, one bounce four"
1321,"SIX, 10 off the first two balls. The back of the hand slower one does not come out right for Thampi, ends up as a nice juicy full toss for batsman, who heaves it into the crowd at deep mid-wicket"
1322,"out Caught by Brendon McCullum!! A fine knock comes to an end. He had to go and could only manage a miscue to long-on. Might have been the slower one from Pk, the speedgun shows it as 119kph, batsman wanted to hit it straight back over him, got it nowhere close to the middle and McCullum running across from long-on takes it with ease. batsman c Brendon McCullum b bowler 72(48) [4s-8 6s-2]"
1323,"FOUR, top shot! PK missed his yorker by a couple of inches and that was enough for Pathan, he opened the bat face on the loft and placed it wide of long-off. The opening of the bat was important to get the placement right"
1324,"FOUR, last two balls ruins the over for PK. It was turning out to be a good over until then. Full toss on middle and leg, Pathan whips it square and there's no protection in the deep, 12 off the over"
1325,"FOUR, full toss and Pandey cashes in. He stands deep in the crease and slices the drive square on the off-side, sweeper had no chance of cutting that off"
1326,"out Bowled!! Thampi deserved that wicket. Has his arms aloft and roars in delight as well. A yorker that swirls back in, Pandey clears his front leg to have a clear swing of the arms, missed and the ball deflected off the pads, crashed into middle stump. Pandey never looked at ease in his stay. batsman b bowler 24(21) [4s-2]"
1327,"out Suryakumar Yadav Run Out!! 1 run completed. What was Pathan doing? Suryakumar wanted to give him the strike and Pathan didn't budge. Very full delivery around off, Pathan squeezes the drive to long-off. Baz gets across to the ball quickly and fires a wide throw to the striker's end. Karthik collects and throws the ball on to the stumps. Suryakumar was sent back and he couldn't get back in time. Caught well short of the crease. Suryakumar Yadav run out (Brendon McCullum/Karthik) 1(1)"
1328,"FOUR, he's only dealing in boundaries. bowler tried the change of pace to fox the batsman, but it went too full and landed right in the slot for batsman to drive, credit to batsman for delaying the shot to get the timing right and hit it well wide of the man at long-off"
1329,"FOUR, this is almost predictable. bowler has the pace to trouble batsman, so one could see the bouncer coming. batsman was already backing away before the bowler delivered the ball and easily managed to pull it over mid-on"
1330,"FOUR, the idea was right from bowler - to opt for a fuller one as follow up for the bumper - the execution was poor. It's a full toss and batsman slices the drive over cover-point"
1331,"SIX, gee, this is the shot of the match so far. Could well be the shot of the day. Highest score for batsman in T20s. Thampi bowls a length delivery on the leg stump, batsman goes leg-side and lofts the drive easily over mid-off and holds the pose for the cameras"
1332,"out Caught by Faulkner!! In the airrrr, the timing is not there and mid-on back-pedals to take a good catch. The batsman cameo ends, but he's done a great job for his side. bowler bowls flat and on the leg stump cramping the batsman for room, batsman was on the back foot and couldn't time the pull shot well enough to collect another boundary. Totally mistimed it and holed out to mid-on. batsman c Faulkner b bowler 42(17) [4s-9 6s-1]"
1333,"FOUR, that's a gift from Kulkarni. Short of a length delivery down the leg-side, batsman flicks, the outfield is fast, the ball races through backward square leg and fine leg had no chance"
1334,"FOUR, that's too wide and batsman is a very good off-side player. Reaches out to meet the ball, was on a fuller length, creamed through cover from the middle of the bat"
1335,"1 run, uppish, catchable but Finch lets it slip. A tough chance though. Maybe a swifter fielder would have easily had that. Shortish delivery on the stumps, batsman mistimes the pull, Finch didn't move quickly to his right from long-on, tried to grab the ball with his right hand but couldn't"
1336,"FOUR, very straight, batsman kneels down and pulls it along the ground through square leg, no protection in the deep. Looked like the ball came off the inside half of the bat"
1337,"SIX, that's easy pickings for batsman. Full and outside off stump, the ball is turning back in, so the mid-wicket area is a favourite zone for a left-hander, batsman swings with the spin and sends this all the way - the first six for him this season"
1338,"4 runs, oh dear, Jadeja misses the stumps and it's gone for four overthrows. A direct-hit would have seen batsman walk back though. It looked very interesting when he chose the striker's end, despite Uthappa being halfway down the pitch. Should have been a dot ball, but it's four runs now. batsman tapped this to point and thought about a run, took a couple of steps out of the crease, his partner was charging towards the other end, but batsman sent him back. All well in the end for team"
1339,"1 run, steered away to third man"
1340,"out Bowled!! Rashid has broken through. Look at him go. He's thrilled with the wicket of the Pune captain. It's that googly again. Snakes it back in from outside off and cramps batsman up as he lines up a cut. Not sure if he picked it. The ball takes a thick under-edge, goes onto back pad and clips the outside of off stump. Big wicket at this stage. batsman furious with himself. batsman b bowler 27(21) [4s-1 6s-2]"
1341,"FOUR, he's helicopter-slashed it through backward point. Not a great delivery. It's short and wide from bowler, just the kind of ball batsman needs to break his shackles"
1342,"1 run, Tripathi had given up there. But backward point has just one stump to aim at and Vijay Shankar, who is on as a substitute, misses. Even wider than the previous ball and batsman has to really reach out for the cut. He mistimes it to the left of the fielder who turns around quickly after collecting and fires it in. Not great judgement from these two batsmen"
1343,"out Tripathi Run Out!! That's superb from bowler, but equally horrendous running. Never a run there. Rashid sees batsman coming down and spears it into his pads. The ball rolls away beside the pitch and they decide to go through for a single. batsman had a headstart there which may have swayed his thinking. Tripathi was never going to get there. Rashid swoops across, picks up the ball and fires the stump with Tripathi two-three feet short. Tripathi run out (bowler) 59(41) [4s-6 6s-3]"
1344,"SIX, that's as flat a six as they come. Never got over 10 feet above the ground. Lots of power in the bottom hand as batsman swipes an overpitched delivery over wide long-on. Not easy to get under those"
1345,"FOUR, carves it beautifully over extra-cover. Kaul slanted it away outside off and batsman used the angle to his advantage. It looked like he got it close to the bottom of the bat but it still flies away"
1346,"out Caught by (sub)Vijay Shankar!! Full at the stumps, batsman whips it away and it's gone straight to deep mid-wicket. bowler can do no wrong at the death these days. Despite missing the blockhole, he's still able to keep it full enough to ensure that batsman's wrists can't power it over the boundary. You don't want to get near batsman right now. He slams his bat into the ground after crossing the boundary. There's smoke coming out there. batsman c (sub)Vijay Shankar b bowler 10(9) [4s-1]"
1347,"FOUR, questions are bound to be raised over Tiwary's batting position. To my mind at least, he's been in stunning form of late. Such brilliant timing as he whips a full ball from outside off through mid-wicket. team needed that finish to what had been a quiet over"
1348,"1 run, just about carries to Bhuvneshwar but he cannot hold on. Pops out of his fingertips. A low full toss which is very wide of off and batsman squirts it right off the toe-end as he reaches out"
1349,"FOUR, walks across towards off and effortlessly picks it away over backward square leg. Brilliantly timed yet again. Fine leg was up inside the ring and Tiwary picked his spot"
1350,"SIX, he's muscled that over the long-on boundary. Nothing but brute power. It's a decent ball from bowler: a leg-cutter wide of off. But batsman swings his hips, pumps his arms and flat-bats it away"
1351,"FOUR, he's getting into his stride now. An upper-cut over backward point for four. bowler goes short outside off, it's not a very safe delivery with third man up. It's not a safe delivery at all. batsman keeps his shape, doesn't go very hard and just glides it over the fielder"
1352,"FOUR, gets it between his own legs and gets it for four. So unfortunate for bowler. It's a cracking delivery this. Almost a yorker at the stumps, batsman tries to whip it away but nutmegs himself off a thick inside edge and splits square leg and short fine"
1353,"FOUR, full and very wide outside off, batsman reaches out and slices it over backward point. batsman is turning the tables now"
1354,"SIX, hit hard, hit flat, six! batsman, you have been missed. That's sensational ball-striking. It's very full from bowler, most players won't be able to get under it but batsman's wrists and the power he generates are something else. A batsman special"
1355,"FOUR, that's been dropped right at the edge of the boundary. A swirling swipe from Tiwary, the ball gets caught up in the wind and presents the opportunity to Rashid at deep mid-wicket. The ropes would have been on his mind all the time as he's treading a thin line. And he spills the catch"
1356,"1 run, good length delivery outside off, Tiwary mistimes the drive to extra-cover"
1357,"FOUR, batsman breaks the shackles! Runs down the track, looked like he lost his shape on the shot, ends up slapping it through extra-cover, beats the infield and rolls away to the fence"
1358,"FOUR, edged and four, perfect length from bowler, fraction fuller and a hint of shape away from off, brought batsman forward into the defensive push, he nibbled at that, gets a thick edge and the ball races away past the keeper and into the fence"
1359,"FOUR, MS batsman is back! He's back to what he does best. Kaul misses his mark, bowls it full in the slot and batsman spears him through extra-cover for the boundary"
1360,"out Caught by S Kaul!! Bipul has got his man! He slowed down the pace, the length made batsman come down the track, there was no pace on the ball. batsman had to manufacture all the power behind the shot, he was playing against the wind, ends up chipping a dolly - down to the throat of mid-on. Kaul ran across to his right and accepted the offering. batsman c S Kaul b bowler 2(7)"
1361,"FOUR, tossed up outside leg, batsman was looking to play the sweep, gets a fat top-edge, fine leg was inside the ring and the ball lobs him, into the fence"
1362,"FOUR, lovely shot, batsman comes down the track, gets to the ball on the half-volley and lifts it back over the bowler's head, almost went all the way, bounced just in front of the ropes"
1363,"2 runs, Bipul has made a meal of a skier, he never settled himself under the ball, only manages to get his fingertips and lets the ball pop out. This was banged in short and on the stumps, batsman was looking to pull, gets a fat top-edge, high and behind square on the on-side. Bipul called for the catch, it kept swirling around, so did he and wasn't in any position in the end"
1364,"SIX, cracking shot, banged in short and on the stumps, batsman was waiting on it, swivels across and pulls it high and over square leg, no need to run for those"
1365,"FOUR, this is even better, length delivery outside off, batsman comes down the track, makes room as he did so and cracks it square on the off-side, hit on the up and in the gap past point"
1366,"SIX, beautifully played, batsman is making team suffer for dropping him, runs down the track, driven on the up - played with the full face of the bat, a high elbow and deep into the stands at long-on"
1367,"FOUR, .. and he repeats the dose .. once again on the up after shimmying down the track, hits it in the air and in the gap between cover and mid-off, no need to run for those"
1368,"SIX, for a moment, it looked like it went straight up in the air.. but batsman has managed to clear the fielder at deep point. This was full and wide of off, he lost his grip on the hand as he went chasing after it, ended up slicing it high and over cover. The fielder in the deep thought he had a chance, but ended watching it sail over his head. It was the slower ball from Kaul, thought he had done the batsman in by his clever change of pace"
1369,"1 run, maiden IPL fifty for batsman, pushed through outside off, batsman hangs back and works it wide of cover"
1370,"FOUR, lovely shot, tad too short from Rashid, allows batsman to rock back and pull it wide of mid-wicket, no need to run for those"
1371,"SIX, massive, that ruins the over for Bipul, too full and just outside off, batsman bends down low and slogs it high and over mid-wicket, went sailing into the crowd"
1372,"SIX, batsman is ruining Bipul's figures here, slower and just outside off, batsman gets forward and thumps it high and wide of long-on, has the power to sail over the ropes, back-to-back sixes for batsman"
1373,"FOUR, down the track to ram the ball down the ground. He didn't quite get to the pitch of it as bowler saw him coming, but went through the line regardless. Beats mid-on comfortably"
1374,"no run, dropped, it's the Australian captain who has dropped his vice-captain. An Englishman looks aghast. Length delivery outside off, batsman got a big stride forward and drilled it straight to Smith at mid-off, in and out, that was a sitter"
1375,"SIX, top-edge and six, no luck for bowler today. Banged in short and on the stumps, batsman was late on the pull, gets a fat top-edge that sails high and into the stands at long leg"
1376,"FOUR, cracking shot, expensive over from bowler, short and on the stumps, batsman swivels across, rolls his wrists and bisects the two men in the deep on the on-side, rolls away to the fence in a hurry"
1377,"out Lbw!! Big wicket for Pune, but was the ball sliding down the leg-side? batsman was done in for the lack of pace from bowler, he rolled his fingers across this slower ball and drifted it back into the right-hander, batsman was shuffling across on the flick and missed, struck in front of middle and leg, but was the angle taking it down the leg-side? Need to see more replays, but Pune will not care one bit. batsman lbw b bowler 21(14) [4s-1 6s-1]"
1378,"FOUR, too short from Thakur, can't bowl that length with his pace. batsman is quick to rock back and clears mid-wicket with the pull, a few bounces and over the ropes"
1379,"FOUR, lovely, back-to-back boundaries for batsman, runs down the track, gets close to the ball and drives it past the diving fielder at mid-off"
1380,"no ball, SIX, that should break the shackles for team and batsman, this was a high full-toss from bowler, batsman was already pre-meditating the reverse sweep, ends up playing the switch hit and sends it high and over deep point for a maximum"
1381,"FOUR, that's a poor ball from bowler, third man was inside the ring and he went full and wide outside off, batsman reached out for the slice, gets a thick outside edge that cleared the man in the ring"
1382,"SIX, team need many more of these, length delivery outside off, that's right in his hitting zone, clears his left leg and clouts it high and over mid-wicket for a maximum"
1383,"out Bowled!! batsman tries to be too funky and instead loses his wicket. This was a length delivery on the stumps, batsman was setting himself up for the switch-hit, the length was a bit too full, he then decides to pull it away, gets the angles all wrong and misses the ball completely. It goes on and crashes into the top of off-stump. batsman falls after a rather subdued innings. batsman b bowler 43(40) [4s-3 6s-1]"
1384,"FOUR, beautifully played, batsman is playing a fine hand here, short and wide from bowler, batsman waits on it, uses the pace on the ball and cuts it behind square on the off-side, beats backward point and rolls away to the fence"
1385,"FOUR, edged and four, team will take these runs, length delivery outside off, Hooda swung across the line, gets a big edge that flies through the vacant first slip region"
1386,"FOUR, nicely played by batsman, he's playing a gem of a cameo here. Fraction short and wide of off, batsman backs away, waits on the ball and cuts it in front of square on the off-side, beats point to his right this time and rolls away to the fence"
1387,"SIX, massive, bowler misses his mark, offers a length delivery on the stumps, Hooda gets underneath it and sends it high and over long-on, hits the roof of the second tier and bounces back into the ground"
1388,"SIX, cracking shot, this was the slower short ball from bowler, batsman spotted it early, waited on it and slaps it high and over deep mid-wicket, went a long way into the stands. team are finishing well here"
1389,"FOUR, cheeky and four, this was slower bouncer from Thakur. Hooda waits on it and ramps it over Dhoni's head, third man was inside the ring and the ball rolls away to the fence"
1390,"FOUR, nicely bowled but even better played by batsman, raises his fifty as well. Thakur saw batsman backing away, followed him with a full ball. batsman makes room, plays with an open face and drives it through cover, no need to run for those"
1391,"FOUR, back-to-back boundaries for batsman, this was full and on the stumps, batsman was backing away, plays with an open face and finds the gap behind square on the off-side, no one moved"
1392,"FOUR, presses forward causing the bowler to shorten his length, quickly transfers his weight onto the back foot and spanks the pull through mid-wicket. bowler didn't get a lot of height with that and it sat up"
1393,"FOUR, this time he goes fuller, and a little bit wider outside off, and allows batsman the room to free his arms. He's quickly onto the back knee to sweep it away through mid-wicket"
1394,"FOUR, batsman seems to have gained tremendously from his fifty the other day. He's playing with a good amount of confidence and fluency. Back of a length outside off, he punches it away with flair past backward point"
1395,"FOUR, doesn't nail the timing again but he's hit it with enough power to beat mid-on to his right. A full ball slanted in on off, batsman shovels it away down the ground with a lot of bottom hand"
1396,"FOUR, rather than using a horizontal bat this time, he just steers this past short third man and into the boundary. It was a slower ball from Thakur so wasn't a lot of pace to work with. But the timing is exquisite from batsman"
1397,"FOUR, that's such a good shot and so difficult to do against Sundar. He's able to gallop down to the pitch of the ball to lift it back over the bowler's head. Really well played"
1398,"out Caught by Tripathi!! bowler strikes first ball. It's not his best delivery, but he isn't complaining. Slightly on the shorter side at the stumps, batsman quickly jumps back to pull it away but he skies it off a thick top-edge. Easily taken by Tripathi coming in from deep mid-wicket. batsman c Tripathi b bowler 30(29) [4s-5]"
1399,"out batsman Run Out!! This was very similar to the Buttler dismissal, the fielding aspect. batsman's horror run this season continues. His scores: 18, 0 and 0. Back of a length and close to off, batsman knocks it towards cover and sets off on a suicidal run, Hardik runs across, gets a good bounce and under-arms a throw onto the sticks at the bowler's end. batsman was diving to make his ground, but was still short. batsman run out (Hardik Pandya) 0(1)"
1400,"FOUR, crunched! bowler pounds it short of length around off, batsman stands tall and punches it through the crowded off-side field, the ball races away to the fence"
1401,"FOUR, consecutive boundaries to finish an eventful first over. Too straight, on middle and leg, batsman flicks it off his pads past the square leg umpire, the quick outfield does the rest"
1402,"out Caught by Rohit!! What's happening DD? This game ain't over. It has in fact come alive. The in-form batsman departs. Two early wickets for team and just the started they needed. Good length ball around off, might have stopped on batsman, who checked his front foot push and spooned a dolly to mid-off. Full marks for Rohit, he had placed himself close in. If he was on the edge, it wouldn't have carried. bowler is pumped up. batsman c Rohit b bowler 9(6) [4s-2]"
1403,"FOUR, poor delivery and Iyer is off the mark. Slips it onto the legs, just needed a tickle and Iyer got plenty of wood on that, the ball raced away to the fine leg fence"
1404,"FOUR, chipped up. Was a serious miscue. But pockets a boundary for his efforts. With no one at the fence, thanks to all the wickets falling around, batsman lofts it uppishly off the cue end over mid-off. That's all he had to do"
1405,"FOUR, the French cut now. batsman keeping the flag fluttering up there. Gets himself too close for the cut but swishes through. Chops it off the under edge past the keeper. So very French"
1406,"FOUR, brings up the 50 of the stand. A real fightback this. And gets there in some style as well with a lovely looking square cut. Guess what, there is no one out there"
1407,"FOUR, brilliance to end in some sloppiness. A punishing drive this from Morris through the covers and the other KP runs around, swoops and dives to cut off what was meant to be a certain boundary. But in his attempt to get up and throw has his back leg spike brush the boundary cushions. Oh dear, the misery gets worse"
1408,"1 run, shuffles well across. Almost a set of stumps away and flicks it away to short fine. Again, a shy at the stumps at the non-striker's end..a direct hit would have meant curtains"
1409,"FOUR, here comes the streak. Morris gives it his all, just throws his bat out at a short, wide pepper. Only manages a top-edge. More than enough to fly through the cordon"
1410,"SIX, much needed. Courtesy Morris. Walks across, stands tall and gives the sitting up short one a real spank in getting it to fly over mid-wicket"
1411,out Bowled!! The zing bails light up the night sky again. bowler gets out the screwdriver in tightening the coffin. The coffin that had brought Delhi out of the dead. On the base of leg and nothing batsman could do with it. Swings hard but the ball dips in sharply to scoot under the flashy blade. What a welcome batsman's had to the IPL nevertheless. batsman b bowler 44(39) [4s-4 6s-1]
1412,"FOUR, keeps them in the hunt. Gets low on a knee and throws the bat out in carving it square. In the gap too. 19 needed off 4"
1413,"2 runs, more of the same. Pandya persists with the line way outside off and Morris responds with another square drive. Uppish, whistling away off the turf. Just that this time Krunal is present in putting in the dive to keep it down to a couple. Meanwhile Morris has his fifty to boast of. He doesn't know. He doesn't care"
1414,"out Caught by Parthiv Patel!! Iyer has been strangled down the leg-side. The hometown lad doesn't cause much damage. Short and down leg, would have been a wide had Iyer let it pass, instead he sees a run-scoring opportunity, gets inside the line and gloves it to Parthiv. This time he had the bowler and umpire on his side. Third wicket down and DD are in deep trouble. This was a nothing delivery from bowler and it still produced a wicket. Tells you that the rub of the green is with team. batsman c Parthiv Patel b bowler 6(7) [4s-1]"
1415,"out Lbw!! Anderson is gone for nought. bowler is running riot. The extra delivery brings team a wicket. Fourth wicket down and things look bleak for DD. They need something special to get out of this. Good length delivery with a bit of inward movement, Anderson is caught in the crease, beaten on the inside edge and the ball hits the back pad right in front of middle. Umpire Ravi had his finger up in a flash. bowler's current figures: 2-0-7-3. batsman lbw b bowler 0(3)"
1416,"out Caught by Harbhajan!! Another batsman goes without troubling the scorers. bowler has both has his hands up in a gesture which says, that was easy. Back of a length delivery angled across off, batsman hangs his bat away from the body, the ball takes a healthy edge and flies to the lone slipper, Harbhajan clings on comfortably. Five down and things going down very quickly for DD. batsman c Harbhajan b bowler 0(3)"
1417,"out Bowled!! Chopped on! Hardik is into the act now. Six down and just the 24 on the board. batsman becomes the sixth batsmen to record a single-digit score. This is getting embarrassing for DD. Short of a length and just outside off, batsman goes half-hearted on the cut shot, the inside edge crashes into the stumps. No respite for the crowd, they keep going bonkers each over. batsman b bowler 5(15)"
1418,"FOUR, almost another. batsman after getting squared up thanks to the nagging angle being created out here just throws his bat up looking to cut the ball away. Races away off the top-edge and flies through the hands of slip. Rohit the man out there. Too quick for the classification to come under a drop"
1419,"FOUR, oh glorious. As clean as it could get. A pitched up delivery in the arc and batsman gives his top order a facepalm moment with a full bat face presentation. Whizzes past the bowler"
1420,"FOUR, would need many more of these. A wide liner this from Bhajji and Morris capitalizes with a reverse as he brooms it past the lone man perched at point"
1421,"SIX, a dance and a dispatch. Right up, close and personal to a friendly tosser up and excutes the lofted drive. Clears the tallest man on operation at long-off"
1422,SIX. Bouncer. Top-edge. Six! Are you surprised? Oh! The bats these days. Big chunk of edge as Morris drops his head in disappointment. Went for the pull did Jos batsman and Morris' pace took care of the rest
1423,FOUR. Edged. One-bounce. Four. The fluke pays off. batsman comes dancing down the track and slices the flash-drive off the outside edge. Raced away!
1424,FOUR. No pace. batsman picked the bones out it. Shuffles towards the line of the ball and smears it in the gap between mid-off and extra cover
1425,"out Caught by Pant!! Two for bowler-gee! Googly again. batsman hides his bat between his legs after running it off the face of the bat. But, the umpire isn't fooled by any of his tactics. Pings his index finger straight up acknowleding the appeal from the keeper. It twirls away from a good length and massages the edge en route to Rishabh Pant. batsman c Pant b bowler 17(16) [4s-1]"
1426,"FOUR, fine delivery that didn't deserve a boundary. Short delivery right under the batsman's throat, batsman was backing away and was hurried on the pull, the top-edge flies away fine, one bounce and into the fence"
1427,"FOUR, second boundary of the over for batsman. He holds the key for team. bowler goes full and batsman says thank you very much, drilled down the ground past mid-off. That ends bowler's spell, 4-0-36-0. He's still searching for his 100th IPL wicket"
1428,"FOUR, smashed! The crowd are slowly finding their voices again. Flighted just outside off, batsman drives it down the ground. How hard did he strike that? He didn't bother to run, that sums it up"
1429,"FOUR, would you believe it? Morris allows the ball to escape past him. Has his hands up to apologise to Cummins. Short delivery and batsman pulls it without much timing. Morris was reluctant to come for the catch. Tries to take it on the bounce, but the side spins beats him"
1430,"SIX, for a second the ball seemed to be heading out of Wankhede. But just clears the rope. Slower delivery on middle and leg, Pandya clears his front leg and heaves it to deep mid-wicket. Not off the middle and hence didn't go a long way"
1431,"out Caught by Samson!! Huge, huge wicket. With 18 balls to go, batsman could have produced a match-defining innings. Clever cricket from Cummins though, rolled his fingers across the ball at the last instant, batsman had made room to go for a big heave-ho, went through even though there was no pace on the ball. The ball went high up and the cool, calm Samson was under it at long-on. Taken comfortably. batsman c Samson b bowler 26(29) [4s-4]"
1432,"SIX, smoked! Back of a length delivery, Pandya was almost cramped for space, but got a decent connection on the short-arm pull, the ball travels to second tier at the deep mid-wicket fence. Head right on top of the ball was the key there"
1433,"out Harbhajan Run Out!! School boy stuff from Harbhajan. He doesn't slide the bat in and hence pays the price. bowler does not offer any width to Pandya, spears it in the blockhole, an inside edge hits the pad and drops on the pitch. Harbhajan calls for the run and he forgets to slide the ball. Good footballing skills from bowler, runs forward and kicks the ball onto the stumps. If he had slid his bat in, Harbhajan might have survived. Harbhajan run out (bowler) 2(2)"
1434,"out batsman Run Out!! 1 run completed. Pandya had to go for it. He was the man who could cause more damage. Squeezes out the yorker to mid-wicket. Nair had a long way to run in and the batsmen thought the second was on. Nair gets there quickly and fires a flat throw to Pant, who does the rest. Even a full stretch from Pandya is not enough to save him. batsman run out (Nair/Pant) 24(23) [6s-2]"
1435,"FOUR, streaky! But batsman won't mind. He's off the mark in this IPL with a boundary. Very full and on leg-stump, batsman slogs and the inside edge evades the leg-stump, runs away to the fine leg fence"
1436,"no run, dropped by Rishabh Pant! batsman went too far across his off-stump and tried the scoop, he may have played that stroke a touch too early. Spoons it straight to the keeper who was late to pick the ball as the ball swirled around him to distract his attention. Oh, boy!"
1437,"FOUR, pure timing. Just put bat to ball and the timing will take care of the rest. The thing that coaches tell you. PP did just that to a leg-side dart, dances away to the mid-wicket fence beating a desperate dive from one of the fielders"
1438,"SIX, you don't bowl length to this lad. Not when he's in form. Clears his front leg and smokes it with superb ease over mid-wicket"
1439,"out Bowled!! Welcome to IPL, Kagiso bowler. Spears a 145ks tail-smashing yorker in the blockhole, opens PP up and thrashes his leg-stump. World class fast bowling. Nothing much PP could do about it. Too hot to handle. bowler is all pumped up, why not? batsman b bowler 8(11) [4s-1]"
1440,"FOUR. Help-me please. Leg-side fodder, batsman tickles it fine"
1441,"1 run, subtle change of pace. Rana plays it late as he tucks it to short fine. A good throw from the fielder would have had Rana struggling at the non-striker's end"
1442,"FOUR. Right into his plate. Sits up perfectly for batsman, he lifts it with lovely extension of the arms over extra cover"
1443,"out Buttler Run Out!! Rana slams his bat in disgust. Error in judgement and he ends up selling his partner. Just taps the ball to cover and sets off, Samson runs forward, picks it up clean and smashes the stumps. Buttler was nowhere to be seen in the frame. There was no single there, Buttler looked ominous, gee! Buttler run out (Samson) 28(18) [4s-3 6s-2]"
1444,"FOUR, picks the length and reverse-sweeps Amit bowler through backward point. There was a slip in place, but he got the timing right. Risky, but worth it"
1445,"out Caught by Corey Anderson!! Corey Anderson didn't have to move an inch. Straight as a dolly. 140ks short ball. Rana, with the kind of form he is in, looks to tonk it over deep square with a pull. He might have timed that well, but with 140ks thudding your bat, you can't clear the fence every day. Deep square plucks it reverse-cupped. Replays show it came off the toe end. batsman c Corey Anderson b bowler 8(9) [4s-1]"
1446,"out Caught by Pat Cummins!! batsman Sharma has been googlied again. Legspinners are having him for dinner this IPL. Big, big wicket this. Not sure if he read the wrong 'un, was on his knees looking to clear deep square with a slog sweep. Miscued, big time. Cummins gobbles it up at the edge of the boundary. batsman c Pat Cummins b bowler 5(9)"
1447,"FOUR, McCullum is off and running. No sighters needed. Short of length around off, McCullum hops a bit and directs the cut square on the off-side. There was a man at sweeper but he couldn't get there, such was the timing"
1448,"out Lbw!! Sandeep has the early wicket. That was dead in front. One of the easiest decisions Erasmus would have made. McCullum has missed out on a full toss, he closes the bat face tad too early on the flick, beaten on the inside edge and the ball crashed into the back pad. It would have crashed into middle stump. batsman lbw b bowler 6(6) [4s-1]"
1449,"FOUR, easy peasy. Can't bowl on the legs of any batsman. batsman shuffles across to get inside the line, helps it along the way past the man at 45. Off the mark with a boundary"
1450,"FOUR, the boundary that they will need in every over from now has come. Was a bit short, batsman went back and thrashed past the man at cover"
1451,"out Caught&Bowled!! What a catch by bowler on his followthrough, pranced forward in time to snaffle that inches off the ground. batsman was early on the shot, was trying to work into the on-side and ended up spooning it back to the bowler, who was ready for the opportunity. batsman c and b bowler 9(7) [4s-1]"
1452,"FOUR, not the kind of fielding effort you need. batsman got on his knee and helped this flatter ball with a half-sweep. The man from deep backward square leg ran to his right, got to it but fumbled when it mattered the most"
1453,"out Caught by Stoinis!! He's hit this one well. Oh, hold on. Not quite. Does not bother to step down, just goes with the swing, ends up miscuing it and holes out to long-off. Two quick wickets and Gujarat's chase is in danger of going awry. batsman c Stoinis b bowler 4(4) [4s-1]"
1454,out Lbw!! Wow. What moment for Punjab. Third wicket for them in no time. Two in two for bowler. Floats it on the stumps and the new man tries to work across the line. Is beaten in the air and closes the bat face too early. The ball evades the willow and thuds him low on the pad. The umpire obliges the appeal to sink Gujarat's hopes further. Hat-trick ball coming up. batsman lbw b bowler 0(1)
1455,"SIX, they need more of these! batsman goes across the line, the ball did not turn and came in with the arm, helping batsman's swing. Goes well over the cow corner"
1456,"FOUR, gets low and across to use the inward angle from bowler, helps past the man at short fine leg. Welcome boundary"
1457,"FOUR, the length is great on this one but the line is awful. On the legs of batsman and he whips it through backward of square leg. Now they have got the four, need to make it count"
1458,"FOUR, short ball, comes late to batsman - that is what the shot suggested. batsman is early on the pull and slices off the outer edge, over the head of the keeper and into the fine leg fence"
1459,out Bowled!! Yorker! The good old yorker. bowler had been hit for two boundaries already and had to fall back upon to his main weapon. Bowls it right at the base of the middle stump. batsman's swing does not meet the ball and the furniture gets disturbed. What can Karthik do from the other end. He has run out of partners now. batsman b bowler 22(12) [4s-2 6s-1]
1460,"FOUR, there's risk involved but he has to take all that is on offer. batsman reverse sweeps this full ball to place it between short third man and backward point. This is his first fifty of the seaons. Will it be in a winning cause?"
1461,"FOUR, aims for the blockhole and does well. batsman inside edges the drive past the keeper into the fine leg fence"
1462,"FOUR, when batsman is in form, he plays some audacious shots. This was not a bad ball by any means, length ball around off, batsman swats it over mid-wicket and wide of mid-on. That was dealt with disdain"
1463,"FOUR, top shot! Sandeep switches to round the wicket, fires in a low full toss around off, batsman stays low, opens the bat face and threads it behind point, right between short third man and backward point"
1464,"SIX, that spoils the over for Natarajan. It was good until then, but ends up conceding 11. Good length ball just outside off, batsman extends those big forearms and smashes it over long-off"
1465,"FOUR, two fielders dived and both could not stop the ball. Trifle short and batsman is quick to go back and whip it, first beats the dive of mid-on and then deep mid-wicket's. Placed to perfection"
1466,"out Caught by Stoinis!! Second wicket for team in the powerplay. Not many times they have achieved that this season. It is a big one of batsman. Mohit saw the batsman back away to the leg-side, fired it full and outside off, batsman was made to reach, was down on his back knee to drive, couldn't control it and spooned it towards extra cover. Stoinis right on the edge of the circle, dives forward and takes it millimeters from the ground. batsman c Stoinis b bowler 13(12) [6s-1]"
1467,"FOUR, a gift first up for batsman. Short delivery at 128kph, sat up nicely for the in form keeper, who swivels across and pulls it neatly behind square, well away from the short fine leg fielder"
1468,"FOUR, half tracker and batsman pounces on it. It was the carrom ball and turning away, batsman rocked back and slapped it in front of square, no chance for the man sweeping"
1469,"FOUR, rubbish to start off from bowler. Long hop asking to be punished, batsman obliges, rocks back and pulls it in front of square on the leg-side, one bounce and into the fence"
1470,"out Caught by Maxwell!! Massive wicket. 50th IPL wicket for bowler. And there comes the wicket after the break. Not a wicket taking delivery but credit to Maxwell for clinging on. The dangerous batsman is back in the hut. Another half tracker from bowler, batsman pulled and he wanted to clear Maxwell at deep mid-wicket, couldn't get enough power as he was arching back, the team skipper timed his jumped to perfection and took it inches before the rope. After landing he ensured that he doesn't fall over. batsman c Maxwell b bowler 32(24) [4s-4]"
1471,"FOUR, the little things in cricket cost you so much. batsman should have never been on strike, but thanks to Maxwell he was and he collects a boundary. Slower short delivery and batsman swiveled to pull it behind square, good connection as the ball bounced only once before reaching the fence"
1472,"FOUR, and he is away, in style. Gets a tossed up delivery just outside off. Stays leg-side and drives past cover, in the gap"
1473,"FOUR, poor ball to finish the over. And batsman won't let those go. It's short and wide.. well not that wide but wide enough for batsman to stay back and crack the cut past point"
1474,out Caught by Karthik!! And he is gone. First IPL match for bowler and gets rewarded on the second ball. Karthik who takes a decent catch behind the stumps now becomes the first wicket-keeper in the IPL to register 100 dismissals. Here's what happened on this ball: just short of a good length that came in and might have left a bit off the deck to compel batsman to have a feel for it. Enough to get the edge and fly to the right of Karthik. batsman c Karthik b bowler 2(4)
1475,"FOUR, not off the meat of the bat. But still runs away to the fence. Was angled across around off and batsman drove from the crease; toe-ended but had enough to get it past the fielders near the cover region"
1476,"FOUR, clips it fine after getting across. Fetches a four to the fine leg fence to bring up his fifty"
1477,"SIX, batsman is much better off playing conventional cricket shots. Short delivery and at Thampi's pace it sat up for the Australian, who dismisses it with a pull over deep mid-wicket"
1478,"FOUR, shoddy from McCullum. You rarely associate that word with him. Full delivery on off, batsman jams the drive into the pitch and bounces over Thampi, McCullum from mid-off runs across and lets it through. No one to cover him and that's four more to batsman"
1479,"FOUR, batsman's fast hands on display. Quicker and just outside off, batsman stays leg-side of the ball and brings his hands down on the ball, lofted inside out over extra cover, one bounce four"
1480,"SIX, mammoth! Agarwal is brave enough to toss it up to batsman, who plonks his front foot forward and muscles the loft over the bowler's head. Cleared the sightscreen with ease. All bottom hand!"
1481,"SIX, this is buffet for batsman. Couple of steps down and takes it on the full, then heaves it a long way over the cow corner fence. Second six of the over and Agarwal is under pressure"
1482,"out Caught&Bowled!! Maiden IPL wicket for bowler. It's the big one. A well-set batsman departs soon after the strategic break. I guess it should be renamed to wicket-taking-break. Second time today that team have got a wicket after the time-out. Flatter and on the stumps, batsman makes room and slaps it straight back, it was traveling quickly and Agarwal did well to bend down and pouch that. Made it look easy did the youngster. batsman c and b bowler 65(40) [4s-9 6s-2]"
1483,"FOUR, batsman toys with bowler. Plants his front leg across the stumps and hoicks it behind square. Maintained a low base to get underneath the ball and that was the key"
1484,"out Lbw!! Back-to-back wickets for team. Once more batsman has thrown away a start. He did that against team as well and he's team suffered a big loss. Today as well after Amla's wicket, he needed to stay there and bat till the end. Instead he tries an ambitious reverse sweep against bowler, who always attacks the stumps, struck in-line with middle and the slow dreaded finger of umpire Anil Chaudhary went up. batsman lbw b bowler 31(18) [4s-1 6s-3]"
1485,"FOUR, shot! Stand and deliver stuff from batsman. It was the normal speed delivery and right in the slot, batsman didn't have to move much, extends his arms and lofts it straight back over Tye. A much needed boundary for team"
1486,"FOUR, bang! batsman strikes them really hard. Thampi missed the yorker length by a good couple of inches, batsman pumps the drive straight down the ground. Rocketed to the fence and beat long-off with ease"
1487,"out Caught by Brendon McCullum!! The dreaded slower delivery from Tye does the trick. He might have got 90% of his wickets with it. batsman thought it was in his arc and can for the loft over long-off, but since there was no pace on the ball, it lobbed to McCullum, who takes the dolly. batsman c Brendon McCullum b bowler 7(9)"
1488,"SIX, first ball and it is out of the park. Length delivery right in the slot, batsman crouches a bit and tonks it over deep mid-wicket. Plenty of height and the required distance"
1489,"FOUR, streaky! Angled across the left-hander, batsman throws everything he's got at it, the outside edge flies away fine to the third man fence. The man was inside the ring and he had no chance"
1490,"SIX, Doctor Smith changes to round the wicket but there is no respite for him. Proving to be a costly injury that to Nathu Singh. Another length ball and batsman nonchalantly puts it into the crowd at cow corner. 16 off the first three balls"
1491,"out Caught by Finch!! And Smith has a wicket. batsman had to keep going. This time he picks out the fielder. Or rather Finch got to the ball. Dug in short and there was not much pace on the ball, batsman pulls it in front of square, Finch runs a long way from long-on to his left, keeps his eyes on the ball and takes it with both hands while on the move. Excellent catch that. A handy knock from batsman ends. batsman c Finch b bowler 34(17) [4s-3 6s-2]"
1492,"SIX, this time Thampi does not get away with a full toss. There's the big hit batsman was looking for, heaves it towards cow corner and has made a decent connection for the ball to carry over the fence"
1493,"FOUR, and again. bowler is shortish again and on seeing that batsman retreats, opens the face of the bat on the punch and cracks it through cover"
1494,"out batsman Run Out!! Top nut to end the innings. Yorker aimed right at the base of off-stump, batsman jams it back to the bowler and Mohit was going for the run as it was the last ball of the innings, batsman responds but always knew he would not make it. Thampi collects the ball, runs back and takes the bails off. batsman run out (bowler) 10(5) [6s-1]"
1495,"FOUR, cross-batted heave from batsman. The angle was taking it across him but he took his chance, did not get it off the middle. But had enough to beat the man running from deep square leg to his right"
1496,"FOUR, that just about spoils the over for Thampi. Ended up giving room to batsman just outside off. Enough for the latter to camp back and pierce the gap through point with a cut"
1497,"FOUR, Punjab have got boundaries but not all of them have been well timed ones. This one too is not. batsman makes room, tries to go flat-bat on this short ball. Mistimes but does well to get it just over the fielder at mid-off"
1498,"FOUR, too full a ball on off. Cannot be termed a poor ball but the brilliance of batsman. Opens the bat-face at the last moment and squeezes it square on the off-side"
1499,"SIX, as long as they fetch runs - mistimed swing again. Gets over the man at long-on; made a bit of room to this length ball and threw whatever he had. Will be happy with the end result for sure"
1500,"SIX, mishit. Again. Won't use that famous thing..everytime. Yeah. batsman skips down the track and lofts over the man at long-off. Eventually it has enough on it"
1501,"FOUR, dances down the track again. bowler smartly bowls it wide but does not get away. batsman manages to reach on the drive and cracks it to the deep cover fence"
1502,"SIX, there's no reason for bowler to flight and be full. Because one time he tries this, he gets lofted over deep extra cover.. inside out. Goes all the way"
1503,"FOUR, flatter this time. This is a result of what happened on the previous ball. Ends up on the legs of batsman, who helps it to the fine leg fence with a little sweet tuck"
1504,"out Caught by Raina!! Time-out and wickets. The love-story world does not care about! Slower ball around off and middle. batsman gets early on the push and the bat turns in his hand, making the ball to pop up towards captain Raina at mid-wicket. What a soft dismissal that is and that too against the run of play. batsman c Raina b bowler 30(24) [4s-4 6s-1]"
1505,"1 run, confusion but Amla survives. Nathu Singh from short fine leg failed to hit the target at the striker's end. batsman got across to flick this one straight to him. He got the ball, the batsmen in the meantime were staring dead into each other's eyes - standing in the middle of the pitch. Eventually decided to go for the run. And as luck would have it. Amla stayed"
1506,"FOUR, cracking shot, that's a shot of a batsman, batsman comes down the track, gets close to the ball and drills it through extra-cover"
1507,"FOUR, back-to-back boundaries for batsman, shimmies down the track, gets close to the ball and lifts it back over the bowler's head, a couple of bounces and over the fence"
1508,"FOUR, three in a row for batsman, comes down the track to a well flighted delivery and lifts it over Gayle at short extra-cover. This is a smashing start from team"
1509,"SIX, lovely, batsman's toying with bowler, comes down the track, gets close to the ball and lifts it high and over long-on, 18 runs already from the over"
1510,"SIX, excellent cricket from batsman, banged in short and well outside off, batsman got on top of the bounce, used Mills' pace and helps it over the lone slip, went all the way for a maximum"
1511,"FOUR, lovely shot, width on offer from bowler, it was short as well. Manish plays with an open face and carves it behind square on the off-side, beats the man at backward point and rolls away to the fence"
1512,"out Caught by Badree!! That's a soft soft dismissal and Manish is livid with himself. team are well on top now, this was a low full-toss from bowler, Manish could have hit it anywhere. Perhaps, the late dip undid him, ends up whipping it into Badree's hands at mid-wicket. He's a safe catcher and doesn't drop those. team's depth with the bat will be tested tonight. batsman c Badree b bowler 15(16) [4s-1]"
1513,"out Caught by Kohli!! bowler is on a roll! This was a lovely leg-break from bowler, teased batsman into coming down the track, he doesn't get to the pitch of the ball, looks to force it away through cover and ends up getting a thick edge to Kohli at first slip. The team captain swallows it and team fall further into trouble. batsman c Kohli b bowler 0(2)"
1514,"FOUR, risky but four, pushed through flatter and on the stumps, batsman backed away, exposed his stumps and gets a thick edge on the cut, rolls away past Kohli at slip and into the fence"
1515,"FOUR, takes on the tease, takes on the invite and gets himself a pressure releiving boundary. Clears his front leg, steps aside as well in the process and goes inside-out with his lofted drive"
1516,"FOUR, a sweep off a seamer. A major punch on the ego for sure. 127kph, on the sitting up length in the slot and Yadav strolls well across, sits on a knee and unleashes a flat bat to place it to perfection behind square"
1517,"FOUR, length balls at this stage. batsman keeps up with the tradition of putting them away. Gets right iunder it with a burial and just swings his bat through the line. All the timing in spanking it through extra cover"
1518,out Caught by Mandeep!! Another time-out. Another wicket. A sure shot strategy uncovered when things seem to be going the way of the batsmen. A perfectly disguised 107kph back of the hand stuff and batsman after being made to wait swings his bat going for the uppish flick. Miscues and the ball doesn't even have the pace to go all the way. Picks out the lone man at deep mid-wicket to perfection. batsman c Mandeep b bowler 18(21) [4s-3]
1519,"out Caught by de Villiers!! Oh AB. Takes a rocket launched in his direction and makes it look like just another day in office. As clean as it could get. Started off with the ball in the arc for batsman to smash down. And he obliges. Sinking and spanking it over mid-off. Only for AB at the fence to put his hands up, grab it and avoid the overbalancing. Nothing more. batsman c de Villiers b bowler 2(3)"
1520,"out Caught by Tymal Mills!! The hole gets deeper. The collapse gets more dramatic and team lose their last known hope of stealing a few more. A rank drag down this to start off from bowler, Yadav meanwhile opens himself up, shapes up for the pull and outside edges it. Thanks to the sticker on the pitch. Ballons in and out and then back into the palms of short third. Oh Mills. Almost a comical end. batsman c Tymal Mills b bowler 15(19) [4s-1]"
1521,"out Bowled!! A failure to last the duration. A massively long banana peel here that Kolkata just couldn't get rid of. And the innings ends with the light up of the zing bails. Kuldeep exposes his stumps, gallops away and whips angrily. To connect with nothing but thin air. The full slower ball meanwhile makes a real mess of the furniture. batsman b bowler 4(7)"
1522,"FOUR, edged and four, it was deliberate from batsman, but was too close for comfort. Short of a good length and well outside off, batsman played with an open face and dabs it past Gayle at slip, rolls away to the fence"
1523,"FOUR, batsman continues to make merry, back of a length and just outside off, batsman prods across and pulls it back over the bowler's head, a few bounces and over the ropes"
1524,"FOUR, this will hurt team! Nothing wrong with the ball, just a fraction short and wide of off, batsman makes room and punches it in front of square on the off-side, splits the gap past cover and rolls away to the fence. team are off to a flier once again"
1525,"out Caught by Kedar Jadhav!! Much needed wicket for team. Nicely bowled by Mills, he was troubling batsman with his extra pace and bounce. This one angled across the left-hander, batsman was looking to defend with an open face, the extra bounce surprised him, flicked his thumb and carried nicely into Kedar's gloves. The strong stand has been broken. batsman c Kedar Jadhav b bowler 14(11) [4s-1 6s-1]"
1526,"FOUR, lovely shot, fraction overpitched and just outside off, batsman leans forward, presents the full face of the bat and drives it back past the bowler. AB dives but can't stop it, neither does the other diving fielder at mid-on"
1527,"FOUR, sublime timing from batsman, length delivery on the stumps, batsman leans across and clips it towards mid-wicket, it was in the air but well wide of the fielder, races away to the fence in a hurry"
1528,"FOUR, fuller length delivery outside off, the width was there and batsman threw his bat at that, ended up slicing it over backward point and into the fence"
1529,"out Caught by Chahal!! The batsman show is over! This looked like a certain six, but the timing wasn't spot on, Chahal - at deep square leg, watches it all along and makes sure that he didn't step onto the ropes. A big wicket for team. Nicely bowled by bowler as well, shortened the length, rolled his fingers across the seam and made batsman manufacture all the power. He did so, but was just short enough to clear the ropes. That's also the 50th T20 wicket for bowler. batsman c Chahal b bowler 34(17) [4s-6 6s-1]"
1530,"out Lbw!! bowler strikes and team are fighting back into the contest. This was the straighter one from the leg-break bowler, pitched on leg and slid through, batsman was looking to work it towards the on-side, ended up playing right across the line and missed, would have been going on and hitting a good chunk of middle and leg stump. The umpire takes his time and lifts the dreaded finger. batsman lbw b bowler 11(9) [4s-2]"
1531,"wide, out Stumped!! A wide but bowler has completely flummoxed Yusuf here. Big, big wicket for team and Kohli is thrilled to bits. He guessed Yusuf was going to come down the track, fired it faster and down the leg-side, Yusuf was in no position to lay bat on that. Kedar was quick to move to his left, collects the ball and whips the bails off. Yusuf doesn't even attempt to get back. batsman st Kedar Jadhav b bowler 8(8)"
1532,"out Caught by M Pandey!! An England 2014 dismissal. Plays around with his ego here does bowler darting it wide outside off. batsman couldn't resist, throws his bat out stalking it with the drive, way away from his body. Just enough nip under the lights for the ball to grope the thick outside edge and fly away to second slip. Sharp astute captaincy. batsman c M Pandey b bowler 0(1)"
1533,"out Caught by M Pandey!! Kolkata errupt. Oh they've switched loyalties, once again coming back home. An innocuous wide ball here from Umesh. Short as well. Asking to be slapped and obliged by stabbing it right into the hands of cover-point. The ball just stopping a touch on the turf to grab the outside half. batsman c M Pandey b bowler 1(3)"
1534,"FOUR, away in style. Umesh tries the surprise full ball coming back in. Just that his opponent is a master of these tricks. Out-thinks him with a shuffle to clip it away through mid-wicket. Off and running, with some timing"
1535,"FOUR, a wasted delivery. Not quite the line to bowl to the best bat in these situations. Straying down leg hoping to swing it away and clips it behind square. Not quite the ideal one with a 7-2 field"
1536,"out Caught by Uthappa!! The wickets tumble. And so does the team line-up. What on earth is going on? The banana peel that team were subject to seems to have slipped into the team territory. A 147kph bolt here. Bang on the money, short, climbing up and too quick on the pull. The compulsive AB pull. Goes sky high with the top edge and Uthappa almost makes a meal of the grab behind the stumps. Moves all around and settles just about under it. batsman c Uthappa b bowler 8(6) [4s-2]"
1537,"FOUR, the streaky edge comes into play. Doesn't matter, it is the free hit. Throws his bat out at a wide delivery and takes the edge to ensure that it flies past second slip"
1538,"FOUR, oh glorious. In the midst of the madness of wickets tumbling, we have another spanking drive unleashed. Full, wide and carves it away with a square slap"
1539,"out Caught by Woakes!! The Gardens explode. The Garden city self-implodes. The sticker on the track consumes another. Jadhav looks to fetch one from off as he attempts whipping it away. The ball meanwhile takes an eternity in getting onto the bat taking the leading edge on the early flick to balloon to mid-on. Don't forget, Chris Gayle is stuck at the other end. batsman c Woakes b bowler 9(7) [4s-2]"
1540,"FOUR, a release. Full, wide and squeezes it out with a ferocious square drive. Over point and ensures that it keeps wide of third man"
1541,"FOUR, his first boundary. Off a top edge. He wouldn't complain though. Another well-directed short bouncer squares batsman completely after getting him opened up and. He responds with a slash of the horizontal bat and the streaky edge flies almost into the third man ropes"
1542,"FOUR, width. Asking for the slap, gets the slap. But finds it just wide of Pandey;s full stretched dive at point. Rushes away `"
1543,"out Caught by Coulter-Nile!! Is that the game already? The big man has been given a proper working over, and now he succumbs. Short of length, skidding on off the deck, and hurries onto batsman as he tries to heave it over wide mid-on. The ball slices up off the outside half and presents a simple opportunity to NCN moving to his right from mid-off. batsman c Coulter-Nile b bowler 7(17) [4s-1]"
1544,"out Caught by Uthappa!! Wonderful delivery. This time it has taken the edge, has it? Yes. These might well be familiar conditions for bowler, given the freshness in the wicket and the way it's zipping through the surface. He's found his rhythm from the get-go. Short of length, nips away a touch and squares batsman up to take a feather through to the keeper. team routing team pretty bad. batsman c Uthappa b bowler 8(9) [4s-2]"
1545,"out Lbw!! Oh that's out. What beautiful shape from bowler. Floats it up, curls it back in and hits batsman on the pad as he plays right across the line. That's plumb in front of middle. He set him up beautifully with the previous delivery angled across. The crowds are shouting their throats hoarse. Electrifying at the Eden Gardens. batsman lbw b bowler 2(3)"
1546,"out Lbw!! Trapped in the crease and plumb again! This is just unbelievable. Some of the team fans, however minimal their number, are shellshocked. bowler pitches this up, gets some movement off the pitch again and the ball cuts back in with batsman caught in the crease. It hits him right in front of middle, the height not a problem. batsman lbw b bowler 0(3)"
1547,"FOUR, he checks the drive as the ball stops on him from a length, but the timing is splendid. It flies away over extra-cover for a boundary"
1548,"out Caught by Kuldeep Yadav!! That's miscued .. and a really good running catch from Kuldeep. Mills tries to swing a ball into the on-side, gets a thick top-edge which lobs in front of long-off. Kuldeep has to cover good ground and it's not easy to stabilize yourself against the momentum. But Kuldeep does really well. batsman c Kuldeep Yadav b bowler 2(5)"
1549,"out Caught by M Pandey!! It's all over. team have capitulated for the lowest IPL score ever. This time bowler's outswinger finds the edge as batsman prods forward. The ball goes right between second and first slip. Both dive for it. But Pandey, at second slip, pouches it well. batsman c M Pandey b bowler 0(2)"
1550,"FOUR, third man is up and batsman squirts it right off the toe-edge to squeeze this through the gap. A poor delivery from Thakur. This is way too short and wide and although batsman almost failed to reach out, it deserved the punishment that it got"
1551,"FOUR, he's tickled that off middle and leg stump. batsman walks right across, gets a full ball on the pads and just about gets his bat down in time. Would have been plumb had he missed"
1552,"FOUR, walks across. Sits down. Gets under the fuller delivery and scoops it over the keeper. Almost off the toe end but with the field behind square up in the circle it seems safe"
1553,"no run, oh Tiwary. He puts down another. This time it goes right in, only to pop out. A fierce slap this from Karn finding extra cover to perfection. Just that the catch cannot stick in his palms tonight"
1554,"SIX, and he piles it on with a salt rub. Gets a ball in the slot at a good length and just swings his bat out. Tonking it down the ground"
1555,"out Bowled!! He is yet to give a run. But has a couple in the wickets column against his name. Karn looks to stay true to his pinch hitting role with a violent swish of the bat. But just doesn't bother moving his feet while looking to deal with this tight length delivery. Swings, gets the inside edge and watches his bails light up. A big time loss of shape. batsman b bowler 11(10) [6s-1]"
1556,"FOUR, here's the brute. A short one here that refuses to get up. A bare 123kph and batsman spanks it with utter disdain. Pulls the leather off it to mid-wicket"
1557,"1 run, oh a mix-up. Could have been a lot more. But for these missed aims. A polite knock to mid-wicket from batsman and he just charges out to get away. Rohit meanwhile stands half way down the pitch hoping his partner would return. None of that happening though. And the Wankhede doesn't let sound travel, even across the pitch. Rohit has to thank a wayward throw"
1558,"FOUR, a beastly slog. Opens and picks out the top-spinner half way down the track with a swivel to dispatch it just past the reach of a diving Rahane at mid-wicket. Takes his finger tips along as well"
1559,"SIX, well if there is someone catching this it is in the crowds. That's into the railway line. Into one of the Virar locals perhaps. Another variation, in the form of a googly this time and picked out right off the palm as he slogs it while sweeping"
1560,"FOUR, take that. You bowl length at your own peril. bowler learns it the harsh way. A mighty swing of the bat and a punishing drill through the covers"
1561,"SIX, batsman and his front footed pulls. Ah, sublime. Thakur looks to pepper it with banging it half way down and watches it being deposited with a flat bat into the first floor over deep square leg"
1562,"out Caught by Smith!! Another wicket to the break. And all batsman needed to lose his concentration were the 150 seconds. Sees a toss up delivery and compulsively swings his bat looking to downtown with his lofted drives. Enough turn away to take the miscue. Meanwhile Smith sprints from long-off, and juggles before pouching. bowler too is off on a celebratory run. batsman c Smith b bowler 9(9) [4s-1]"
1563,"1 run, fifty #30. Gets there with a standing dab wide of point. All so nonchalant"
1564,"FOUR, he doesn't believe in gentle nudges. Gets a back of a length sitter in the arc and flat bats it with all his might over extra cover"
1565,"FOUR, ruins it further. Hangs back patiently on the back foot toying around with the bowler's mind in waiting for the short-slower combo to get to him. When he does, he heaves and posts it bisecting the two men converging at cow corner"
1566,"out Caught by Stokes!! Oh Stokesy. If not with the bat, he changes the game with the ball. If not with the ball he does it with his diving arounds. Pandya slaps this fullish ball hard. And doesn't bother keeping it down as well. Only for Stokes to run across from the extra cover boundary and dive to pluck it inches off the turf. Is that the game? They've crossed over mind you. batsman c Stokes b bowler 13(11) [4s-2]"
1567,"SIX, it only gets another twist. Spoke too soon. Converts a wide length ball into one in the arc with a run across his stumps. And then it is his swing that takes over. Hacks it across the line and despite the top-edge the big bats ensure it flies into the stands over mid-wicket"
1568,out Caught&Bowled!! Oh he's lost it. An argument with the umpire for the want of a wide has consumed his focus. Another walk across and he goes for an almighty slog swing. A top edge is all he manages with the ball flying high and mighty into the hands of the bowler itself. Did not even leave the pitch. And bowler bangs his head down in the process of almost messing up the catch. batsman c and b bowler 58(39) [4s-6 6s-3]
1569,"out McClenaghan Run Out!! 1 run completed. All over. Gets low on his haunches and carves out the extravagant drive to extra cover. But the quest of wanting a non-existent second consumes another. A flat rocket arm throw from the deep, courtesy Stokes at the non-striker's end catches McClenaghan well short of his ground. McClenaghan run out (Stokes/bowler) 0(0)"
1570,"FOUR, just over mid-on. He was itching to break free. It's slightly fuller from Sundar, but Parthiv isn't quite to the pitch of it. But he goes through with the loft. Enough on that to clear the infield"
1571,"FOUR, that's what he was looking for all this time. Width on offer. Parthiv lashes it away through backward point"
1572,"FOUR, third boundary of the over as Sundar drops it short again and this time, Parthiv pulls him away to the deep mid-wicket boundary"
1573,"SIX, he finishes it with a swat. In style. But it is Pune who'll be celebrating. They've breached the fortress. A lovely strike on the ball with batsman clearing his front leg and slogs it out of the park. Through his favourite area - mid-wicket"
1574,"FOUR, that's unfortunate for bowler. He's deceived batsman for lack of pace while also bowling it wide of off with batsman swinging leg-side. The cutter grips a touch, takes a thick edge and flies fine of short third man"
1575,"out Caught by Washington Sundar!! The slower ball has worked. batsman drags it straight to long-on. He backed away looking for the big hit, maybe over mid-off, and bowler followed him with a leg-cutter to deny him the room. The lack of pace on the ball meant that it didn't come on as well as batsman wanted and he ended up dragging it off the inside half. Simple catch for Sundar running in. batsman c Washington Sundar b bowler 17(13) [4s-3]"
1576,"no run, did that carry to Tiwary? Oh what a big wicket that would have been. Round the wicket, slanting the ball in on a back of length and getting it to straighten a touch. Rana fences it to slip. Oh, this is close. It might have just fallen short. Centimetres"
1577,"FOUR, poor from Thakur. He strays in line again. That's not what Pune want at this stage as they strive to crank up the pressure. Parthiv picks it off his hips and glances it past short fine leg"
1578,"out Caught by Unadkat!! Short of length, Rana heaves into the on-side but he's in no control of it whatsoever. The ball has flown off the top-edge. He's gone. Pune making a match of this. bowler might have cut his fingers across the ball. Rana wants to heave it away off the front foot but it's onto him much quicker than he thinks. Essentially, it was a break-free short after having been kept quiet. Third man runs in and holds on. batsman c Unadkat b bowler 3(9)"
1579,"FOUR, wow. That's been driven on the up and over mid-on. Powerfully struck from batsman. Maybe he's decided that's the way he wants to go today"
1580,"out Bowled!! Maiden IPL wicket for Sundar. He's slid that right through Parthiv. Risky shot to play really. Darted in and skidding on from round the wicket, Parthiv wants to cut it off the stumps but the ball hurries onto him. He doesn't have much room to work with either. Cleaned up. batsman b bowler 33(27) [4s-4]"
1581,"FOUR, that's beautifully done from batsman. He was initially beaten by the turn on this leg-break, but he didn't commit so he was able to open the bat-face and steer it past slip"
1582,"FOUR, that's a magnificent shot against the turn. But because it was so full, he really didn't have to worry about it. Drifting in on middle, batsman whips it away over mid-wicket"
1583,"SIX, what a wonderful shot! Shows the nature of the track. An away-slanter from a good length, batsman squats, reaches for it and slaps it over cover. Off the middle and the ball has enough wings to go all the way"
1584,"FOUR, almost a maximum. Dances down the track and elevates this shortish ball over point with a fierce cut. He played it uppishly and almost got the distance. One bounce and into the fence"
1585,"1 run, direct hit at the striker's end and Rahane is in. The TV umpire was called for assistance. Easy one for him. Short of a good length delivery wide of off, batsman taps it towards backward point and responds to a quick call from Rahane. Pollard finds the target, but Rahane was easily home"
1586,"FOUR, batsman will use his feet against the spinners. Is quick to get out of the box and gets to the pitch of the flighted delivery, thumps it past the bowler. Karn had no chance to even get a fingertip on that"
1587,"out Caught by Pollard!! Pollard under a high-ball, you expect only one result. A fine hand from batsman ends. Deserved a fifty. Smart bowling from Karn, his second and making the most of the opportunity. He saw the batsman advance and threw it wide outside off, batsman had to reach out for the loft and he miscues it towards long-off. batsman c Pollard b bowler 45(31) [4s-3 6s-2]"
1588,"2 runs, dropped! Harbhajan spills a sitter. That would have been a huge moment in the game. Tossed up on off, batsman not completely down on his knee to sweep, hence the ball lobs towards deep square leg. Harbhajan runs across to his left and goes with both hands, but manages to grass it. He was on the move and that made it difficult for him to control the ball. Karn is disappointed, he should have had his third"
1589,"FOUR, that's adding salt to the wound. Karn drags the length back and batsman is all over it, uses the depth of the crease to hammer the pull past the diving mid-wicket fielder, no one in the deep to stop that"
1590,"out Bowled!! 200th T20 wicket. He dropped him last over and now has removed the dangerous batsman. Not much harm done. Look at bowler go. He's letting all his frustration out. Shouting and roaring at the top of his voice. Slows it up and drops it short, batsman is early into the pull, the ball takes its time to beat the bat and hit the top of off-stump. Wicket off his final ball and bowler ends with: 4-0-20-1. batsman b bowler 17(12) [4s-2]"
1591,"FOUR, gift first up for batsman and he says thank you very much. Fired full and down leg, might have been the attempted yorker, batsman helps it away fine and the pace of bowler takes care of the rest"
1592,"FOUR, streaky! Not where he intended but will take the final result. Steps out and aims for a nudge into the on-side, the inside edge nutmegs him and runs away to the fine leg fence"
1593,"out Bowled!! Cleaned 'im up. It was right in the slot for batsman and he misses it altogether. bowler came round the wicket and pounded it on a length ball on leg-stump, batsman clears his front leg and heaves, but failed to connect with the ball. Crashed into leg-stump and bowler has his first wicket of the game. Big wicket at this stage. batsman b bowler 17(12) [4s-2]"
1594,"FOUR, in the air and just short of Hardik at mid-off. bowler stays round the wicket, the cross-seamer outside off, Tiwary checks his drive and the ball lobs towards mid-off, dips in front of Hardik and runs away to the fence"
1595,"FOUR, back-to-back boundaries. Follows up the full delivery with a short one, Tiwary is on one leg to pull it away behind square leg. The man was inside the ring and there was no one stopping that"
1596,"out Bowled!! Dragged on. No heroics from batsman today. team are chipping away at the wickets. Five down and bowler has his name on wicket's list. The umpire checks for a no-ball and bowler has some part of his foot behind the stumps. Good length ball around off, batsman goes for the pull and the ball does not bounce as much as he anticipated, the inside edge crashes into the stumps. batsman b bowler 7(11)"
1597,"FOUR, cracking shot! Brings up the 150. Half volley and not many batsmen miss out. batsman clears his front leg and pumps the drive through extra cover. No one at sweeper cover to stop it"
1598,"FOUR, dug in short and Tiwary fetched the pull from outside off, not off the meat but the key thing was he got it in the gap, between deep mid-wicket and long-on"
1599,"FOUR, bowler misses the yorker and Tiwary thrashes it away. He gets underneath the ball and smashes it towards the cow corner fence, one bounce and into the fence. Good start to the over"
1600,"out Lbw!! The apprentice is doing the job for team. Second wicket for him and both have come in the death overs. The off-cutter and deceived Tiwary completely, he didn't pick it and shuffled across to nudge it to the on-side, missed and is struck in front of middle stump. HawkEye shows it to be clipping leg-stump. batsman lbw b bowler 22(13) [4s-4]"
1601,"FOUR, good looking shot. bowler pitches it up and batsman meets it with a straight-batted drive. The bowler can't stop it and the mid-on fielder can't get there with a dive. Races away into the fence"
1602,"FOUR, wow! Just a mere push and the ball dribbles away into the fence. bowler comes round the wicket and darts it in full just outside off, batsman prods forward and middles the straight drive/push. Gets it well wide of mid-off and the quick outfield does the rest"
1603,"FOUR, nice shot! There wasn't room there for batsman to free his arms. He goes deep in his crease and manufactures his own to cut it through covers. A teasing chase for the cover fielder. Escorts the ball till the fence"
1604,"SIX, that's a monster! Dhoni-esque. Flat, quick and overpitched, right in the slot for batsman to swing his bat. Clears his front leg and tonks it over long-on for a gigantic six"
1605,"FOUR, nice shot to end the powerplay.Eleven runs off the over. bowler slightly tosses it up, batsman hangs back and flicks it wide of mid-on. Once it cleared the fielder, there was none to stop that"
1606,"3 runs, batsman uses the extra bounce outside off and late-cuts it wide of the keeper. Mitch McClenaghan, runs, slides and flicks the ball back into play. Saved a run for his team there. 50-run stand between the duo as well"
1607,"FOUR, bowler drops it short and batsman stays in his crease and cuts it over backward point"
1608,"FOUR, bowler shortens his length seeing batsman come down. He looks to cut and gets it off the toe end. The ball evades the keeper and runs away into the third man fence"
1609,"FOUR, short of a good length delivery, batsman nails the pull well in front of square on the leg-side. This is turning out to be an expensive over"
1610,out Caught&Bowled!! First wicket for bowler in Mumbai colors. batsman was undone by that top-spinner. He was looking to cut as he thought it was a leg-break. The extra bounce hits the top portion of the bat and lobs up in the air. The bowler calls for it and takes a straightforward catch. batsman c and b bowler 38(32) [4s-5 6s-1]
1611,"SIX, good effort from the man in the deep, but he couldn't stop it from going into the fence. A 68-metre six. A leg-break, batsman gets down and slog sweeps. Doesn't quite get it off the middle of the bat. Nitish Rana at deep mid-wicket waits for it at the edge of the rope. But, the ball had just about enough elevation to go over him"
1612,"FOUR, easy. Don't bother. When you have such good hands, just put bat to ball. Short of a length, sat up wide of off-stump, batsman flays it over point. Period."
1613,FOUR. Well placed. Needles the gap between mid-off and extra cover with a firm drive. Lot of bottom hand power on that
1614,"FOUR, throws his bat at a wide delivery and gets four. Thick edge and it races away past the cordon"
1615,"FOUR, up and over! Rises on his toes and lifts a wide ball with a flat bat, over cover and into the fence"
1616,"1 run, a dazzling fifty for Robbie! That was short and he was quick to swat the pull away for a single. Soaks in the applause as the team camp is happy and so is the skipper"
1617,"1 run, slower short ball, the ball climbs onto the batsman. batsman gets a top-edge and the man running in from the short fine leg region - Sundar drops it. The ball popped out as his elbows thudded onto the ground. Another dropped chance, another charmed life"
1618,"SIX, some salt into the open wounds being garnished in by batsman. The ball was short but batsman was tall enough to smack the pull away over cow corner. He wants a quick finish"
1619,"FOUR, slower, much slower short ball. batsman has all the time in the world to place the pull behind square on the on-side to tease the man from deep square to give it a valiant chase"
1620,"FOUR, ton for the combo!! That was deft, cute, earns a four with the help of an open face of the bat. The dive from the man at short third man spelt agony for Pune. The match continues to slip away"
1621,"SIX, looked like a mishit but that has gone for a half-a-dozen. The ball was in his zone and the batsman played the cross batted swipe to tonk the ball away over deep mid-wicket"
1622,"2 runs, third umpire was called in but batsman has made it. Fifty for skipper. Yet another valuable knock from the skippy. His 100th game for team, all as skipper and he has again stepped up in a crucial game. The ball was cut away into the off-side and the throw came in at the striker's end to which Dhoni flicked it back onto the sticks. GG had made it easily"
1623,"FOUR, ramps the ball over the man at point and that will run away for another four. This is turning out to be a canter for team"
1624,"SIX, onto one knee! The story after that is scripted. The author - batsman just looks into the stands. The ball has disappeared into the stands at the cow corner region"
1625,"SIX, this one is a sequel to the previous six. Meatier and bigger. He knelt down and clobbered the slog sweep deep into the stands. That should be six and a half, Danny would agree for sure"
1626,"out Caught by Tripathi!! batsman tries to do it with a glory shot but the slower short ball has done him in. Not before he has taken them to the doorsteps of a fine win. The slower ball hung onto the surface, the batsman was early into the slapped pull and managed to get a huge top-edge. The man at long-off back-pedalled and took it close to his chest. batsman c Tripathi b bowler 87(47) [4s-7 6s-6]"
1627,"out Caught by SN Thakur!! The short ball does it again. The batsman late on it as the ball bounced a tad bit more. In the end, the spliced up parabola was taken at mid-on. batsman departs after yet another wonderful knock. batsman c SN Thakur b bowler 62(46) [4s-6 6s-1]"
1628,"FOUR, crunches the drive through the covers and that is it! team win!! They will spring to the top of the points table thanks to this mauling. The target of 183 never ever looked enough. Going back to the final ball: in the zone and batsman threaded the ball into the gap with a lot of muscle power"
1629,out Narine Run Out!! Narine is horrible when it comes to running between the wickets. Just pathetic I must say. batsman should have been aware of it. Just tickles the ball to short fine and rushes for a quick single. Narine had to respond. Thakur underarms the throw and then the MS special. Good game awareness. Just deflects the ball onto the stumps with sheer ease. Narine run out (SN Thakur/Dhoni) 16(11) [4s-3]
1630,"FOUR. Just stand and deposit. Stays firm and picks the length early to lash a one-bounce four over mid-on, just an extension of the drive"
1631,"FOUR, he does this time. Rocks back and nails the cut square on the off-side. No-one moved"
1632,"FOUR, half-volley. Errs in length and batsman makes full use of...Times the pants of a drive through extra cover"
1633,"FOUR, street-smart cricket. Saw third man was inside the ring, just opens the bat face and runs it fine of him. Lovely"
1634,"FOUR, dropped by Unadkat. He has made a habit of hurting his head this lad. A complete mistimed cross bat swing from Robbie, swirls high and looks to be setting safe into the hands of deep mid-wicket. Unadkat keeps swirling with the ball, lands awkwardly on his back as he bumps his head onto the ground. To make matters worse, it dribbles away to the boundary triangles"
1635,"FOUR, advances, gets to the pitch of the delivery and nails the straight drive. Take four"
1636,FOUR. Deft. Uses the crease to make subtle adjustments and glides a slider with a silk touch down to third man
1637,"SIX, on one knee and spank! Right towards the pitch of the delivery and he goes kaboom over wide long-off"
1638,"SIX, make that two in a row. Over long-on this time. Good hand-eye coordination as he smears the ball with a clean swing of the willow"
1639,"SIX, had a good piece of that did Robin batsman. Got underneath and marmalized a floater over long-on for a 83-metre maximum over long-on"
1640,"FOUR, gorgeous. So pleasing to the eye. Watches the ball bull-eyed and extends his arms over the loft over mid-off. Pure timing"
1641,"FOUR, vintage batsman. Shuffles outside his off-stump and hacks one into the deep backward square area. The key was he watched the ball till the last minute and ensured he dropped the stroke in no-man's land"
1642,"FOUR, edged and four, that will go down as a chance, but it climbed over Uthappa, he had no chance of taking it. Short of a length and shaping away from outside off, batsman was rooted to his crease as he frailed at that, got a thin edge that flew over the keeper's outstretched gloves"
1643,"FOUR, loosener from Kuldeep. Rank long hop on off, batsman had all the time in the world to go deep in the crease and pull it in front of square, wide of deep mid-wicket and batsman is getting a move on"
1644,"FOUR, beautiful! Such a good cricketing shot. batsman backs away to go inside out, bowler fires it on the stumps, enough room to loft it handsomely over extra cover. One bounce and into the fence"
1645,"FOUR, precise placement from captain batsman. Floaty chinaman turning in around off, batsman stays low and plays the half sweep/pull, in the air and bisecting the two fielders in front of square on the leg-side"
1646,"FOUR, streaky! Short and turning in, batsman goes with all his might on the cut, the ball takes the top-edge and flies away fine. No chance for Yusuf to haul that in"
1647,"out Stumped!! Is this match being played in Pune? Then why are they cheering for the fall of their own? That is because the wicket brings MS Dhoni to the middle. The carrom ball which is short in length, batsman just took a step out and tried to carve it into the off-side, beaten and Uthappa was quick this time. The back foot was initially on the line, batsman lifted it to get back in and Uthappa took that opportunity to light up the bails. batsman st Uthappa b bowler 46(41) [4s-4 6s-1]"
1648,"FOUR, more sloppiness. This time Yusuf lets one through the legs. batsman comes down the track and flicks it to mid-wicket, straightforward stop and Yusuf makes a mess of it. Right through him and batsman is underway"
1649,"SIX, you put fielders close to me, I will hit the ball out of the park. batsman is taking the aggressive option. This time gets right under the ball after dancing down, smokes it straight back over bowler for a maximum"
1650,"SIX, chants of ""batsman, batsman"". He's looking in ominous touch here. Not all that short from Kuldeep, batsman went deep in the crease and might have top edged the pull, looked mistiemd at first, but the ball kept gathering momentum as it flew over the deep mid-wicket fence"
1651,"FOUR, second time batsman has got a streaky boundary off bowler. Short and wide outside off, he throws the bat on the cut, right off the cue-end and the ball runs away fine to the third man fence"
1652,"out Stumped!! Huge wicket this. Full marks for GG as well. Bowling a spinner in the 18th over, you don't see that often. The youngster has outfoxed the master finisher. The googly which is short in length, batsman runs down the wicket and is beaten by the turn, does not get the body behind the line, Uthappa whips the bails off in a flash. Kuldeep loved that wicket. Jumps and follows it with a fist pump. batsman st Uthappa b bowler 23(11) [4s-1 6s-2]"
1653,"out Stumped!! Take a bow Gautam Gambhir. It was a brave move to bowl Kuldeep and he is now reaping the rewards. Two wickets in the over. One of Dhoni and the other of the in-form Tiwary. The wrong 'un keeps bamboozling the batsmen, Tiwary like others does not pick, lunges forward to work it into the leg-side, missed and beaten comprehensively. Uthappa takes his time to remove the bails, but does so in the nick of time. Tiwary's back leg was on the line and he didn't even attempt to get it back in. batsman st Uthappa b bowler 1(2)"
1654,"SIX, super shot! bowler was a bit predictable there. Full and wide outside off, batsman lined up for the loft over extra cover and nailed it to perfection. All the way and a much needed one for team"
1655,"SIX, back-to-back sixes and now we know why GG was relcutant to bowl the spinners at the death. Length delivery right in the swinging arc, batsman is known for his big-hittin and he thumps this over the cow corner fence"
1656,"SIX, 16 balls without a boundary or a six, now team have three on the trot. This is a top shot. A difficult one to play. Wide yorker outside off, batsman opens the bat face and carves it over point. Nice connection and pinged the ad boardings"
1657,"1 run, fifty for batsman. This was a long time coming. He got a few starts in the previous games but hadn't converted them. This time he does. Another wide yorker and batsman squeezes it to backward point"
1658,"FOUR, cracking shot, long half-volley on batsman's pads, that's easy pickings for him, prods across and clips it in front of square on the on-side. The man in the deep is square and has no chance"
1659,"FOUR, lovely, much better from batsman, should make him feel much better. This was a back of a length delivery outside off, he stands tall, gets on top of the bounce and punches it in front of square on the off-side, beats cover and rolls away to the fence"
1660,"out Caught by M Pandey!! Wicket off the final ball. Full toss and batsman smacks it straight down the throat of deep mid-wicket. He backed away slightly and didn't have the space to free his arms, mistimed it and Pandey gobbled that up with ease. batsman c M Pandey b bowler 16(6) [6s-2]"
1661,"FOUR, beautifully played, just a little shimmy down the track, batsman made room as he did so, drives it on the up and beats cover-point to his right, no need to run for those"
1662,"SIX, batsman breaks the shackles, at first look - he didn't looked to have timed it, but it kept soaring high and into the stands at long-on. Just short of a good length and outside off, batsman swung through the line and collects his first maximum"
1663,"FOUR, smashed, length delivery outside off, batsman comes down the track, takes it on a half-volley length and drills it back past the bowler, no need to run for those"
1664,"FOUR, nicely played by batsman, makes rom to a well flighted delivery, gets down on his knee and goes inside out over cover-point, a few bounces and over the ropes"
1665,"FOUR, batsman isn't afraid of the mystery bowler, gets down low, uses his reach to good effect and sweeps it to the right of square leg, beats the diving fielder and rolls away to the fence"
1666,"FOUR, back-to-back boundaries for batsman, almost an action replay of the previous shot, gets down low to a well flighted delivery and sweeps it in front of square on the on-side, the fielder at square dives to his left and can't stop it, ends the powerplay in style"
1667,"1 run, Yusuf has made a mess of a simple chance, ran back from mid-wicket, got to the ball, went with both hands and shells it. Looks bad on replays. Coming to the ball, it was short and just outside off, batsman swung across the line, got a fat top-edge - high and towards mid-on"
1668,"out Bowled!! Piyush has broken through the dangerous opening stand, batsman falls after a fine hand. This was the wrong 'un from Piyush, batsman didn't read it, backed away on the cut, the ball kept spinning back into him, cramped him for space, gets the under-edge and the ball goes on to crash into the leg-stump. Piyush gives him a send-off, but batsman has done his job. batsman b bowler 38(23) [4s-7]"
1669,"FOUR, lovely shot, friendly full-toss from bowler and batsman takes full toll of it, shuffles across and shovels it in front of square on the on-side, beats the man getting across from the deep"
1670,"FOUR, cracking shot, tossed up just outside off, batsman bends down low, gets on top of the bounce, rolls his wrists over and sweeps it in front of square on the on-side. de Grandhomme has no chance - getting across to his right from deep mid-wicket"
1671,"FOUR, goes with the spin and gives it a full whack. Quick to rock back, pulls as hard as he can, Mandeep Singh from long-on does well to make a diving stop, but he seems to have made contact with the boundary triangles, the boot to be precise"
1672,"FOUR, looks as if batsman has been given the license to express himself. Six balls, six whacks. Stamps his weight on the back foot and powers a biff-drive past a diving mid-off"
1673,"FOUR, superb stroke! Punched off the middle, don't move! Uses the crease to adjust his feet movements as he unveils it in the gap between cover and point"
1674,"SIX, that's been launched! Full in the slot for batsman and he isn't standing on ceremony there. He certainly isn't. Lots of flight from bowler, batsman's eyes lit up. Huge six down the ground"
1675,"SIX, that's a smaller six but perhaps a better shot as he had to drag it from outside off. So much power in the bottom hand as he swipes a flat six over wide long-on"
1676,"FOUR, flighted on middle, there's no one at square leg and batsman is quickly down on his knees to sweep him to the boundary"
1677,"FOUR, he's just toying with them. It's his day today. bowler tosses this leg-break up outside off and batsman swats the reverse-sweep away very fine. All intentional, all in control"
1678,"out Caught by de Villiers!! Gone. batsman's knock comes to an end. Flat from bowler, following batsman as he backs away, cramps him up a touch and he miscues the pull straight to long-on. But what a knock it's been. He's blown team away. batsman c de Villiers b bowler 72(34) [4s-5 6s-6]"
1679,"SIX, races to the pitch of the ball and lofts it over wide long-on. batsman may have the net run-rate at the corner of his eye"
1680,"FOUR, that's a really good shot. It's inside-out but it's off the back foot which is not easy to do at all. Flat from bowler and sliding in, batsman stays in the crease and somehow finds the power to lift it over extra-cover and take it to the boundary"
1681,"FOUR, another one. He's timed this even better. Up and over extra-cover, the fielder dives in the deep but the ball sneaks through"
1682,"FOUR, short, inviting. batsman clears his front leg and pulls it in the gap behind square square, there's no-one there and that will be an easy boundary"
1683,"out Lbw!! bowler's go-to delivery, the skidder. He may have anticipated a slog-sweep from batsman and fired it straight on the stumps. Also the length was the key, neither full; nor short. Enough to defeat the batsman's instincts and strike him dead in front. batsman was way too early on the shot. batsman lbw b bowler 16(11) [4s-4]"
1684,"out Caught by de Villiers!! Game on! Both openers are back in the hut and it's that man, Samuel bowler, again. Shimmies out to loft the bowler over long-on, wasn't to the pitch, hits it right of the cue and holes out to the safest fielder on the planet. A-B-D. Clever from bowler as he followed B-Mac and fired it too close for his liking. batsman c de Villiers b bowler 3(6)"
1685,"SIX, why use the feet when you have such beautiful hands. What power, woof! Gets underneath this venom-less slider and smacks it onto the roof at deep mid-wicket"
1686,SIX. Kaboom. Make that two in a row. batsman wants to take the attack to the opposition. This time he fetches the ball from leg stump and goes spank over wide long-on. Madness...
1687,"FOUR, plenty of width, batsman throws the bat and gets a thick edge which races away to the third man fence"
1688,"FOUR, makes room while clearing his front leg and bludgeons Sreenath bowler straight down the ground. Can't slot fielders for that kind of a shot"
1689,"SIX, down the wicket and bam! Was nowhere near the pitch of the delivery, but fast hands and power of batsman takes care of everything. No half-measures. Swung it as hard as he can and got it over mid-wicket"
1690,"FOUR, mistimed, but worth it. He saw there was no-one at deep mid-wicket, takes on the short ball and despite the ball getting big on him, he pulls full-throttle. Excellent batting"
1691,"FOUR, he is picking the gaps to perfection tonight. Covers for the line and lofts gorgeously over extra cover. He is turning it on..."
1692,"SIX, how does it matter? He is smashing the ball into the crowds. A half-volley on the pads, he whups it for a 97-metre maximum over mid-wicket. Just compare Raina's score with batsmany. Tells you that he's in some mood"
1693,"2 runs, fastest fifty by a team player in the history of IPL, off 22 balls. Pitched up, batsman looks to drive firmly, it takes a big chunk of bottom half before dancing down towards the third man fence. A diving stop keeps it down to two, but cannot stop batsman from reaching fifty"
1694,"FOUR, slides this way too wide outside off and batsman reaches out to dab it away for his first boundary. Hasn't been himself today, maybe this will get him going"
1695,"SIX, there goes the riposte from the team skipper. He planted his feet leg-sidish and created enough room for a whip of the hands. The ball soared into the stands"
1696,"FOUR, not where he intended, but team will take any run now. They have become like golddust. Quicker around off, batsman goes for the steer and chops it off the under edge, nutmegs Karthik and runs away to the boundary"
1697,"FOUR, again. Once more bowler fires it across the left-hander, batsman still does not get the connection right on the dab, races away fine off the under edge and no chance for short third man"
1698,"FOUR, batsman welcomes bowler with a superb drive. He makes a bit of room to open up the off-side field, bowler helps his cause by dishing it full, pumped through extra cover and wide of long-off"
1699,"leg byes, FOUR, back of a length on off, batsman is early into the pull. The ball kisses the back thigh and escapes past Karthik, he dived over the ball there. Bonus runs for team"
1700,"SIX, a much needed six. Soni is brave enough to toss it up, batsman kneels down and fetches the slog sweep from outside off, smacks it over long-on and has the crowd going again"
1701,"SIX, Soni is trying too many things. First ball - leggie. Second - googly. Third - the front of the hand slider, batsman flat-bats it over extra cover. Just about has enough wings to clear the rope"
1702,"out Caught by Basil Thampi!! Maiden IPL wicket for Soni. batsman wanted to smack another one out of the park. What was the need? You have to ask him. It was quicker and on off, batsman could not quite get underneath that, but still went through with the swipe, Thampi at deep mid-wicket didn't have to move an inch to pouch that. Another set batsmen throws it away for team. batsman c Basil Thampi b bowler 32(19) [4s-3 6s-2]"
1703,"out Caught by Ishan Kishan!! team can do no wrong today. While team cannot find a way to stop the slump. What was batsman thinking playing that shot? Quicker and on the stumps, batsman goes for the heave into the leg-side, skies it towards deep mid-wicket. The ball hung in the air for a long time. Kishan had a fair distance to cover, he reaches there and slides across to cling on. Super take from the youngster. batsman c Ishan Kishan b bowler 3(3)"
1704,"out Caught by Jadeja!! There goes team's last hope to post a decent total. batsman 's horror IPL continues. For the third or fourth time this season he has got playing the cut shot. Short and wide, it was there to be smacked, batsman cracks the cut straight to Jadeja at backward point. Third wicket for Tye and he takes his tally to 12. batsman c Jadeja b bowler 8(14)"
1705,"FOUR, finally a boundary after 30 balls. Gets the crowd and cheerleaders going. They have been quiet all evening. Low full toss and Choudhary drives it uppishly wide of extra cover, Finch at long-off gave up the chase very early"
1706,"1 run, they are running for everything. The back of the hand delivery and batsman is early into the drive, the inside edge rolls to the right of Karthik, he shies and misses. Choudhary survives"
1707,"out Caught by Brendon McCullum!! Easy peasy. McCullum makes it look so easy. The slower delivery right in the slot, batsman spotted it and went on one knee to smash it out of the ground, did not get the elevation and hits it to long-on. McCullum first reverse cups it, but the momentum was taking him over, tosses the ball up, comes back in and completes the formalities. batsman c Brendon McCullum b bowler 9(16)"
1708,"out batsman Run Out!! 1 run completed. team have been bowled out. Another back of the hand slower one from bowler, batsman drills the drive to long-off and Choudhary calls him for the second. McCullum gets to the ball and releases it quickly to Karthik, who does the rest. For the first time in IPL, team have been bowled out in consecutive matches. batsman run out (Brendon McCullum/Karthik) 1(2)"
1709,"FOUR, slashes at that, the ball creams the outer part of the bat and goes between short third man and backward point for a four. It was full and well outside off. The bait was there and batsman didn't back off"
1710,"out Caught by Finch!! batsman has a smile, a frustrating one as he departs. That was short, at his body and batsman closes the face of the bat on the pull but finds the man at short fine leg to perfection. He doesn't believe his luck. He timed it well but placement deserted him. The fielder - Finch gobbles it up somehow as the ball threatened to pop out. Massive strike from bowler who has both hands up in the air and soaks in the moment. He has scalped one of the best in the business. batsman c Finch b bowler 10(13) [6s-1]"
1711,"out Caught by Karthik!! The ball nips away and takes the edge. First Kohli, now batsman. team are under heavy weather. batsman has a lame poke at it without any feet and manages to edge it. Karthik behind the stumps has one of the easiest bargains. team have started off on a roaring note. batsman c Karthik b bowler 8(11) [4s-1]"
1712,"out Caught by Raina!! The ball rears up, the batsman fails to get his hands out of the way and manages to edge it for Raina to take it at first slip. Good captaincy as he had himself there for this ball. All going team's way. batsman has a look of disbelief as he stares at the wicket. He had no clue as to how the ball sprung up from that length. On a hat-trick is Tye. batsman c Raina b bowler 0(1)"
1713,"FOUR, short delivery and the batsman is quick to latch on it. The short deliveries were getting predictable and the batsman rocked back to slaughter that. The man in the deep - Tye, dives but fails to pull it back"
1714,"FOUR, strays on the fuller side with length, on the pads with the line, flicked nonchalantly over the man at short fine leg for a four. Kedar is away!"
1715,"FOUR, up and over screams Danny. Short ball zoning into the batsman, batsman archs his body back and uppercuts the ball away over the man at point for a four. Hat-trick of fours and team try to break the shackles"
1716,"FOUR, uncocks the wrists on impact and goes inside out to get a four over cover. One bounce into the fence. Shot of the day so far. The execution looked serene despite not a lot of followthrough with the bat. Just a suplex of the wrists"
1717,"SIX, drops down on one knee and sends the ball skywards. That was a maximum, the moment it left the bat. He pumelled that with all his might and the ball landed well into the crowds in the cow corner region"
1718,"out Bowled!! Poor shot!! Tries to be cheeky and loses his woodwork. That was flat and at the sticks, the batsman tried to open the face of the bat and run it down but misread the trajectory and the length to be clean bowled. team break the momentum and get the huge scalp against the run of play. batsman b bowler 31(18) [4s-4 6s-1]"
1719,"out de Villiers Run Out!! Miscommunication personified. The two men were clueless, stranded almost midway on the 22 yards and the end result is a calamitous one. ABD is gone. That was pushed away into the off-side with the outer half of the bat and then the mix-up followed. Yes-no, yes-no, ABD somehow moved past batsman and the direct hit at the striker's end meant the end for him. ABD did make the initial call though. de Villiers run out (Jadeja) 5(11)"
1720,"FOUR, first boundary of the match, short and angling into Karun's hips, he gets inside the line and tucks it behind square on the on-side. Fine leg was inside the ring and the ball rolls away to the fence"
1721,"FOUR, nicely played by batsman, short of a length and on the stumps, he leans forward, presents the full face of the bat and flicks it over mid-wicket, beats the infield and rolls away to the fence"
1722,"SIX, well tossed up delivery and the batsman slog sweeps it out of the park. That brings fifty for batsman! This has been a fine knock from the keeper-batsman. This might as well break the shackles"
1723,"FOUR, dragged down short delivery and down onto the leg-side, the batsman swivels on the pull and gets it fine past the man at short fine leg for a four"
1724,"1 run, fifty of the combo comes up! That was on the pads and clipped away uppishly for the man at deep mid-wicket"
1725,"SIX, short delivery, sans any pace and the batsman hammers the pull away over the man at deep mid-wicket for a sixer. Iyer has changed gears as well"
1726,"2 runs, pushes it away into the off-side for a quick single and a direct hit at the bowler's end would have seen the back of batsman but he survives as there was no direct hit and in the end, gets an extra run on the overthrow"
1727,"FOUR, Looks to heave the ball away, the ball trims the leading edge and soars up for the man at third man to make a meal of that. The ball bounced up after landing in front of the man at third man - Pathan, who tipped the ball over the bar"
1728,"FOUR, poor ball, tickled away past the man at short fine leg and back-to-back boundaries get Delhi off a to a good start in this over"
1729,"SIX, Bang!! Boom!! Short ball and the batsman transfers his weight ever so slightly to thwack the ball over the on-side towards cow corner region for a huge six. That was almost lost in the clouds"
1730,"out Lbw!! The ball tails in and raps the batsman in front of the sticks. The ump had no hesitation in raising his finger. The batsman was trying to walk into the clip but lost his balance in doing so and missed the full, straight ball. End of another good knock from batsman, he continues to have a good season with the bat. batsman lbw b bowler 60(38) [4s-4 6s-3]"
1731,"FOUR, drops it short does bowler and the batsman scooters back to pounce on it. Munches the cut past the man at backward point to send the ball racing into the fence"
1732,out Lbw!! That was full and straight from round the wicket and the batsman misses it to be out LBW. That was going down is what I feel. But the ball tailed in a touch and the batsman was falling over a bit to give the impression to the umpire that the ball struck the batter adjacent to the wickets. A lucky one for team there. batsman lbw b bowler 6(4) [4s-1]
1733,"FOUR, short, wide, room, batsman cashes in. Opens the face of the blade and gets a four. Just used the pace of the bowler"
1734,"FOUR, that was an explosive drive from batsman. Full and wide, the batsman threw the kitchen sink piled with utensils to spear that between cover and mid-off. Iyer is getting a move-on"
1735,out Lbw!! The full swinging in delivery does it again. A hint of reverse and the batsman again misses trying to play across the line of the sticks. He was as dead a as a dodo. That delivery was quick as well and didn't allow the batsman to bring his bat down in time. NCN vindicates his skipper's decision to bring him back. batsman lbw b bowler 47(34) [4s-4 6s-1]
1736,"no run, lucky is batsman! That was scooped back to the bowler who lets it pop out. Dolly of a catch it was as the batsman pushed it back on the clipped drive"
1737,"1 run, shot back like a bullet by batsman and the bowler spills another one. This was a tough one and almost burst through the hands of the bowler. It was a flighted ball and the batsman found it in his radar and slapped it back with ferocity for it to be fluffed"
1738,"out batsman Run Out!! batsman finally runs out of luck and commits harakiri. Pushed the ball away with soft hands into the off-side and then yes-no, yes-no in the middle ensured both men were stranded mid-way. In the end, the ball was flicked up to the batter's end and the keeper did the rest to find batsman well short. batsman run out (Gambhir/Jackson) 2(5)"
1739,"FOUR, full on the sticks, the batsman winds up for the heave and picks the delivery away into the on-side for a four. There was no one square on the on-side and a four to start the over"
1740,"out Caught by Woakes!! Full delivery sliced away and Woakes in the deep came charging in and takes a great catch diving forward. That was full and again some tailing movement accompanied the ball. The batsman despite getting a meaty part of the bat on it failed to clear the man in the deep. In this sapping heat, Woakes putting in an effort like that speaks volumes of his fitness. batsman c Woakes b bowler 11(10) [4s-1]"
1741,"SIX, cracking shot, fraction too short from Umesh, batsman is quick to swivel across, uses the pace on the ball and helps it on its way, went sailing over the ropes at backward square leg"
1742,"FOUR, too straight from bowler, ends up drifting onto Karun's pads, he uses the pace on the ball and flicks it behind square on the on-side. The man in the deep was very square and has no chance"
1743,"FOUR, lovely, no wonder - the Daredevils are backing him despite poor form. This is a top shot, 'exquisite - a proper cricket shot', gushes KP on air. Nothing wrong with the ball, on a good length and just outside off, Karun leans forward, drives it on the up and splits the gap past cover-point, no need to run for those"
1744,"FOUR, nicely played by batsman, back of a length and just outside off, he waits on it, opens the face of the bat at the last moment and taps it past the lone slip, beats the man getting across from third man"
1745,"FOUR, beautifully played, on a good length and just outside off, batsman leans forward, drives it on the up and splits the gap between cover and cover-point, rolls away to the fence in a hurry"
1746,"FOUR, back-to-back boundaries for batsman, this is some supreme batting from the two Daredevils openers. Cross seasm delivery from bowler, but it's short and wide of off, batsman waits on it and cuts it behind square on the off-side, beats the inner ring and rolls away to the fence"
1747,"out Lbw!! bowler has got past the dangerous opening partnership. Karun was looking solid, but gets too ambitious and pays the ultimate penalty. This was tossed up on the off-stump line, Karun went down on his knees as he looked to play the slog sweep, missed it completely and was struck on the back thigh-pad. Was the impact outside off? Need to have a look at the replays, but it was certainly hitting the stumps, the umpire doesn't think a lot, up goes the dreaded finger. Replays prove he was just about right, both impact and hitting the stumps remained with the umpire's call. batsman lbw b bowler 15(17) [4s-3]"
1748,"FOUR, there's the width and there's the first boundary for batsman. No feet movement at all from the spinner, stands his ground and slashes it off the outer half to third man, the fielder was inside the ring and it turned out to be a safe shot"
1749,"out Bowled!! Thank you for coming. One ball is all bowler needed to send the dangerous batsman back to the hut. Full, fast and straight - the mantra to get batsman out. bowler angled across the left-hander, batsman's feet went nowhere with the prod forward, the ball beats the outside edge and clatters into the off-stump. Early wicket for DD. batsman b bowler 4(4) [4s-1]"
1750,"FOUR, Iyer helps batsman to get off the mark with a boundary. Full and drifting onto the pads, batsman with the kind of form he's in, clips it through mid-wicket. Iyer did the hard work of getting to the ball, but slipped while gathering it"
1751,"byes, FOUR, Pant had no chance. 147kph bumper that kept climbing, batsman ducked under it and evaded it with ease, but unfortunately Pant couldn't glove it even with a full stretch upwards"
1752,"SIX, picks the bones out of this googly from bowler. It was tossed up generously and as soon as batsman picked it, he decided it was going in the stands. Heaves it way over long-on. It was right in the slot too"
1753,"FOUR, this is gentle pace from Anderson. At 127kph, he has tried to bang it in short. The ball sits up for batsman and he pulls it off the waist through mid-wicket"
1754,"out Uthappa Run Out!! Nair has one stump to aim at from point, and he nails it. Uthappa is gone here. He looks surprised as OUT flashes on the big screen. Thought he was in. But he's a yard short at least. Nair is really swift to get onto the ball as batsman chops it to his left. Quick gather, quick release and a rocket throw. But the magic in the field has come 10 overs too late. Uthappa punches gloves with batsman as he walks off. Uthappa run out (Nair) 59(33) [4s-5 6s-4]"
1755,"FOUR, so much time for batsman against someone of Anderson's pace. The ball is short and wide, batsman plants his back foot a foot outside the off-stump to get to the ball and then slices it away past backward point into the boundary. Brings up two milestones with this one shot. Another fifty for him, as well as 6000 T20 runs"
1756,"FOUR, really poor delivery from bowler. He strays in line, tosses it up on leg stump and all batsman does is paddle him away fine into the boundary"
1757,"FOUR, that's a tired dive from Zaheer at backward point. He's struggling with his hamstring too, so can't really blame him. But bowler is just seething. He turns around in disgust. But this is awful bowling to begin with. Bowls it short and wide again, and batsman slices it neatly to the left of Zaheer. A younger fielder would have stopped that"
1758,"1 run, pushes a single down to long-off"
1759,"FOUR, drops it short again and Pandey swats him to the right of long-on to finish a truly horrendous over from bowler. 13 off it"
1760,"out Bowled!! Absolutely shatters middle and leg-stump. Pandey doesn't have a clue. A pacy, full ball at 146kph which bursts right through bat and pad. His feet aren't moving, he is playing across the line, he is beaten for pace. Poor technique from Pandey. bowler exposes it and how. batsman b bowler 5(4) [4s-1]"
1761,"FOUR, that's more of a steer than a cut. Width on offer from Morris as he starts a new spell, batsman times it beautifully as he guides it past backward point"
1762,"FOUR, DD are just waiting for this to get over. The field is well up. Morris bowls it full just outside off and batsman just has to get his placement right as he drives through extra-cover"
1763,"FOUR, a good little cameo this from batsman. He's handling himself really well. Short of length into the body, he swivels nicely and pulls it away through backward square. Uppish but in the gap"
1764,"FOUR, flicked away to the mid-wicket boundary. No one bothers to move. Huge open space in the field. Poor from DD. Not at all mindful of the net run rate"
1765,"FOUR, first ball from Anderson and it is smashed for four. Short, wide and batsman had the width to free his arms, slaps it behind point and third man had no chance"
1766,"FOUR, errs in line and that is enough for batsman to collect a boundary. On leg-stump, batsman gets inside the line and uses Cummins's pace to glance it past the diving short fine fielder"
1767,"leg byes, FOUR, sprays it down leg, batsman can't meet with the tickle, but the ball brushes the pad to beat Pant to his left. Poor ball that from bowler"
1768,"FOUR, in the air and just over the leaping mid-on fielder. batsman is early into the pick up shot, more of a leading edge and the ball balloons over a backtracking mid-on fielder. The practice wickets take care of the rest"
1769,"FOUR, greeted with a dance down the wicket, gets right to the pitch of the flighted delivery and lofts it with the turn over mid-wicket, one bounce and into the fence. He's one of the best players of spin"
1770,"FOUR, now batsman uses the pace of bowler to pick up a boundary. He waits and waits for the ball to arrive, then at the last second opens the bat face and runs it past the slip fielder"
1771,"FOUR, lovely shot! Another 50+ stand for the duo. Continuing from where they had left off in Pune. Loopy leg-break on the stumps, batsman makes just a bit of room and chips it beautifully inside out. The onus was on timing rather than power. Long-off dived in vain to stop that"
1772,"SIX, sharp short delivery and batsman is up for the challenge. He gets into position quickly and nails the pull behind square, flat and all the way. Good start to the over"
1773,"FOUR, full on off and middle, batsman flicks it uppishly over the mid-wicket fielder. Not timed well enough but has enough fuel to collect himself a boundary"
1774,"SIX, 16 runs off the first three balls. This is the best of the lot. Good length ball on the pads, batsman just picks it up nonchalantly and places it into the stands at deep mid-wicket"
1775,"SIX, he promised some fireworks this year and he's keeping up his words. Anticipated the length to be short, got quickly into position and smashed the pull over the deep mid-wicket fence"
1776,"FOUR, in the air and over the fielder. Cummins pitches it up and batsman does not need a second invitation, drives in the air and over Mishra at mid-off. Even a full length jump from Mishy wasn't enough"
1777,"1 run, fifty for batsman. It is his fourth this season. Waves the bat around, walks towards his skipper and shakes hands. Got it in 26 balls against team, today has taken two balls less. Back of a length and on the hips, tucked square on the leg-side"
1778,"FOUR, the runs keep flowing. The 100 is up for team. The equation is down to a run-a-ball. This should be a cake walk. Banged in halfway down the wicket, batsman swats the pull over mid-wicket. He had to really reach out and did well to avoid the fielder"
1779,"FOUR, guess it was against Pakistan in 2016 World T20 batsman played a superb knock. He knows the conditions well here. Doesn't move much, gets inside the line of a fullish delivery and lifts the drive over extra cover"
1780,"FOUR, inswinger, batsman exposes all his stumps and spanks it straight down the ground. Sheer power"
1781,"SIX, short ball at 131ks, angled into the body. Bring it on says batsman as he swivel-pulls a 77 metre maximum over square leg."
1782,"FOUR. Whang! batsman is making full use of the opportunity. Clears his front leg and smokes a full ball over mid-on. There's Warner at long-on, but he can't get there in time"
1783,"FOUR, drops a dolly short for the batsman to slap the ball away through the covers for a four. batsman is away"
1784,"FOUR, action replay of the previous ball and that has been powered away through the covers. The man at sweeper cover despite not having to cover a lot to his right, ends up being a spectator"
1785,"FOUR, the partnership between batsman and Eoin Morgan is now 50. Short ball, flatter in trajectory and the batsman stays back to cut it away between short third man and point"
1786,"SIX, fetches the length ball and then thwacks the ball over long-on. Length in the later part of the innings spells doom for the bowlers"
1787,"FOUR, length ball at the sticks and the batsman slashes the ball away across the line and threads it between long-on and deep mid-wicket. Fifty for Marsh! Another valuable knock from the run-machine from Punjab"
1788,"FOUR, BOOM! Flat bats the short ball and Warner at long-on had no chance to grab that. Even the FEDEX would have been proud of that forehand smash"
1789,"FOUR, Hooda was hoodoo-ed there! Drops a skier at deep mid-wicket. The short ball it was, batsman took on the bait and managed a huge top-edge. The fielder in the deep made a meal of it as it went through his hands and to make matters worse, the ball bobbled away into the fence"
1790,out Caught by Deepak Hooda!! The slog sweep comes out wrong. The extra bit of flight induces the big fat top-edge on the slog sweep and Hooda this time doesn't err. He runs across to his right and takes it with both hands. There was no turn on that ball but the batsman was expecting some. batsman c Deepak Hooda b bowler 26(21) [4s-2 6s-1]
1791,"FOUR, jumps out, takes the ball on the half-volley and then goes straight down the ground. On a bounce and into the fence goes the ball. The use of the feet ensured batsman got an important four against the leggie"
1792,"1 run, dabs the ball to point and allowed Yuvraj, standing at point to have a shy at the batting end. A direct hit and Shaun Marsh would have been miles short of his ground"
1793,"FOUR, short delivery and slightly wide as well. The batsman opens his arms and cuts it away. Hooda in the deep puts in the slide but the ball goes away from him to hit the cushion"
1794,"SIX, WOOAAAAHHHHHH! That was out of the top draw! A length ball it was and the batsman cracked it over covers for a maximum. That should have been awarded a dozen runs just for the execution of it"
1795,"FOUR, another chance for batsman! This time Warner at deep mid-wicket allows the ball to burst through his fingers. Warner came in and then missed it. That was walloped though. The ball lands into a puddle"
1796,"out Bowled!! A length ball, batsman looks to pull and manages an inside edge for the ball to canon onto the sticks. That was a nothing shot from him. Kaul gets away with a length ball but the good thing was he kept it closer to the sticks. The ball might have hurried onto the batsman after it hit the deck. batsman b bowler 2(4)"
1797,"FOUR, Marsh cooking up some great momentum now. Flurry of boundaries. Low full toss from bowler as he misses the wide yorker. Marsh uses the pace and steers it to split short third man and backward point"
1798,"out Caught by Deepak Hooda!! Hooda under the skier again, and he takes it this time. Makes amends. But massive props to bowler, stepping up to answer his captain's call once more. He's done it time and again this season. Uses the knuckle ball to deceive Marsh who is early into the heave. The ball is launched into the night sky, Hooda comes in from deep mid-wicket, settles under it and overcomes a slight bobble to grab hold of it. That should seal it. batsman c Deepak Hooda b bowler 84(50) [4s-14 6s-2]"
1799,"FOUR, right off the toe-end of the bat as batsman chases a very wide ball from bowler, squirts it away past the keeper into the third man boundary. Went very fine"
1800,"FOUR, overpitched outside off and batsman crashes it through extra-cover. Blistering shot. He's in some good hitting form, carrying on from the last match"
1801,"2 runs, he's miscued that, but manages to place it to perfection in between long-on and long-off. Actually, Williamson got there from long-on with a one-handed effort but hardly managed to get fingers on the ball. A length ball which batsman wants to tonk down the ground, just couldn't get hold of it. Back for two"
1802,"out Caught by Warner!! Another miscue, this time he won't get away. It's Warner under it, and Warner takes it. Clever slower ball from Kaul keeping the line well outside off and the ball cuts away further to ensure that batsman slices it in the air. Warner moves to his left and takes it comfortably. batsman c Warner b bowler 16(9) [4s-2]"
1803,"FOUR, dipping slower full toss, 113kph, Anureet swings it away to the square leg boundary. Kaul disgusted with himself"
1804,"FOUR, Anureet has unintentionally played the perfect slice to split short third man and backward point. He just swings hard at this length ball, wanting it carve it over extra-cover. The bat face opens beautifully on impact and the ball pops perfectly into the gap"
1805,"out Caught by Deepak Hooda!! Third catch for Hooda after the drop. The ball is full and angling across off, Mohit slices it in the air after throwing his bat at it. Simple catch at sweeper cover. batsman c Deepak Hooda b bowler 2(4)"
1806,"FOUR, bowler not impressed, either by the effort from the keeper, or by batsman's attempt at a pull. batsman is rushed by this short of length ball and sends an outside edge past the diving Ojha into the third man boundary"
1807,"FOUR, mid-on chases...chases...chases and the ball wins the race. Not quite off the middle, but batsman will take it. Slogs a length ball across the line to the right of mid-on where Siddarth Kaul comes second in the race"
1808,"out Caught by Henriques!! Big, big wicket this. The knuckle ball. Front of the hand slower ball, batsman was way too early into the shot, looks to flay it over the infield, but instead slices it off the bottom half. It keeps sailing and soaring high, Henriques at cover runs back and plucks it with minimum fuss. batsman c Henriques b bowler 23(11) [4s-4 6s-1]"
1809,out Caught by Williamson!! That's it. bowler bags a third as Anureet hits a full toss straight down the throat of long-off. Sunrisers bag their first away win this season. batsman c Williamson b bowler 15(12) [4s-2]
1810,"FOUR, lovely, lovely shot! Pitched up outside off, Marsh drives on the up and gets it in the gap between cover and extra cover"
1811,"FOUR, waits on the slower ball and cuts it at the last possible second. Bhuvi at third man runs to his right and puts in a dive, couldn't quite get his body behind the ball"
1812,"out Caught by S Kaul!! The slower ball works...bowler persists with the same tactic, he fires it around off and middle denying all the room batsman wanted. He lifts the stroke off the upper half and chips it straight to Kaul mid-on. Simple catch. batsman c S Kaul b bowler 3(6)"
1813,"FOUR, short ball, angling away outside off, Marsh gets a thick top-edge on the pull which sails over the keeper for a one-bounce four"
1814,"out Caught by Nehra!! Remember Kohli's dismissal yesterday? This was more or less the same. Maxi couldn't have picked the fielder any better. It was a length ball drifting into the pads, batsman looked to have timed the flick perfectly but little did he knew that the ball would go straight to short fine. Nehra gee ain't dropping that. batsman c Nehra b bowler 0(2)"
1815,"FOUR, poor first ball from Hooda, dropped it short and wide of off, Marsh makes room and crunches it wide of point, no need to run for those"
1816,"SIX, cracking shot, just a little shimmy down the track, Marsh gets close to the pitch of the ball, extends his elbows and lifts it high and over long-off, went a long way into the stands"
1817,"FOUR, another boundary and Marsh is piling it on. Hooda overcompensates and drops one short and wide of off, Marsh makes room and punches it in front of square on the off-side, beats mid-off and rolls away to the fence"
1818,"FOUR, Marsh is looking in sublime touch! Width on offer from bowler, a gentle loosener to start, he leans back and cuts it square on the off-side, beats the fielder in the ring and rolls away to the fence"
1819,"FOUR, first boundary for team. It was marginally short and batsman is on it in a flash. Quickly transfers his weight and pulls it to deep mid-wicket. The fielder there had no chance of cutting that"
1820,"FOUR, this is poor from bowler. Sprays it down the leg side, all batsman had to do was to get some wood. He gets plenty of it and the ball races down to the fine leg fence in a jiffy"
1821,"out Bowled!! Big, big wicket for bowler. batsman makes room and exposes all three stumps. Misses the slog sweep and the ball rattles the middle stump. Punjab will be delighted with this as batsman would have taken the game further away from Punjab. batsman b bowler 51(27) [4s-4 6s-4]"
1822,"1 run, gently knocks a flatter delivery to the right of bowler and runs for a risky single. bowler slides and aims, misses by a whisker, had that hit batsman would have been in trouble"
1823,"SIX, touch short and spanked! batsman is quick on his wheels as he jumps back to thump bowler over mid-wicket. Mighty!"
1824,"FOUR, in his half and he smashes it for a one-bounce four over mid-wicket. Good, clean swing of the bat"
1825,"FOUR, batsman seems to be in mood today. Shuffles across his stumps and dispatches a slower ball with a thumping flick wide of short fine"
1826,"out Caught by Maxwell!! Maxi you bewdy! What.A.Catch. Misjudged it for a fleeting moment at deep mid-wicket, but timed his leap to perfection to grab it over his head mid-air. Bonzer. All that after batsman swatted a fullish delivery over mid-wicket. batsman c Maxwell b bowler 77(48) [4s-9 6s-1]"
1827,"FOUR, on the pads, he will hit those all day long. All batsman needed to do was to get bat on ball, tickled away with ease"
1828,"FOUR, should have been a single, but a bit of bad bounce adds to Vohra's woes as he ends up conceding a boundary. Yuvi lifts the drive on seeing the line wide of off and gets a lucky a boundary"
1829,"FOUR, full toss, plenty of room on offer and Yuvi flays it away square on the off-side"
1830,"out Caught by Axar!! There you go! Yuvi's vulnerability against off spin has come under scanner, once again. It was fired flatter and into the batsman from round the wicket, Yuvi smacks it high into the night sky. More elevation than distance. Long-on gobbles it up with ease. batsman c Axar b bowler 15(12) [4s-2]"
1831,"SIX, half-volley and batsman dismisses it out of his sight. Loads up and launches it over square on the leg-side"
1832,"FOUR, too full and wide, batsman reaches out and uses his bat angle to slice it fine of third man. There's a desperate dive, but the timing was too good"
1833,"FOUR, too much width and batsman says thank you. Crouches and pierces the gap between backward point and short third. Amazing"
1834,"FOUR, boy look at that strike-rate! He is watching the ball like a hawk tonight. Shuffles a long way across and scoops bowler's slower delivery over short fine to bring up his fifty"
1835,"SIX, wow!! batsman is up and running. Similar line from bowler. batsman won't miss out this time. Swings hard and connects well to deposit it into the fine leg stands. A huge hit from batsman"
1836,"FOUR, that's crashed into the fence. Full length delivery on the stumps and batsman won't stop himself from clearing his front foot and nailing one to long-on"
1837,"FOUR, batsman picks the length quickly. Stands tall and pulls it well in front of square. Gets his third boundary with that"
1838,"FOUR, what a shot that is. Nothing wrong with the delivery. batsman gives himself room and thumps it wide of mid-off. No chance of stopping those"
1839,"SIX, batsman is out of the box quickly and lofts it over mid-on. This white ball surely travels. Goes way into the stands"
1840,"SIX, 50 up already for team. In the slot and batsman clears his front foot to nail this straight over the bowler's head. Into the second tier"
1841,"no run, dropped! Quicker delivery outside off, batsman cuts it and gets a thick outside edge. Saha couldn't hold onto the catch. Wasn't an easy one either"
1842,"FOUR, angles it into the left-hander. batsman slogs across the line and hits it to deep mid-wicket. Didn't get it where he wanted, but had enough bat to fetch him a boundary"
1843,"FOUR, two good balls followed by a poor one. Fires it down the leg side, batsman gets his paddle out. Short fine leg fielder is just a spectator"
1844,"SIX, batsman spoils bowler's over. Just short of a yorker and batsman clears his front foot to thump it straight over the bowler's head for his third maximum"
1845,"SIX, batsman is picking the spinner well today. Comes down the track in a flash and gets to the pitch of the ball to nail this over long-on"
1846,"FOUR, streaky runs for batsman. Has a wry smile after that. Slogs across the line and gets a thick inside edge past the keeper. Wasn't far away from the stumps either"
1847,"FOUR, short delivery down the leg. Not the ideal length to be bowling at that pace for batsman, who waits for the ball and turns it to vacant deep square leg"
1848,"FOUR, this is class from batsman. bowler corrects his line but still goes for four as batsman waits for it longer and steers it past point. Third man had no chance"
1849,"1 run, fifty for batsman. Gets there with a risky single. Hits it straight to point and set off. Anureet Singh fumbles and allows the duo a single"
1850,"1 run, fifty for batsman now. Taps it to square leg and gets to the milestone. Raises his bat to the crowd and soaks in the applause"
1851,"FOUR, poor line from bowler. batsman helps it down to fine leg and gets another boundary. Actually it was clever bowling from bowler, he saw batsman race down and fired it down leg, but the southpaw outdid him"
1852,"FOUR, cracking shot, width on offer from bowler, batsman leans into the ball and cracks it in front of square on the off-side, splits the gap past point and rolls away to the fence"
1853,"out Caught by Christian!! batsman had to go for it, but he shouldn't have hit it straight down the ground. Kohli is fuming under that helmet, but he doesn't reveal anything. He's standing there helpless. Expectedly, with a left-hander on strike and batsman known for his big-hits, bowler bowls the googly that is well outside off stump, the batsman would have ideally wanted to hit that over cover, but he hit it very straight and offered a simple catch to long-off. batsman c Christian b bowler 3(7)"
1854,"out Caught by Smith!! Catching practice for Smith. bowler opts for the googly, finishes around the leg stump, batsman doesn't control the flick, hits it straight to mid-wicket. team would want to wrap this up quickly and boost their net run rate. batsman c Smith b bowler 5(8)"
1855,"SIX, that's a googly too short and batsman thrashes it. Shortish delivery and down the leg-side, sits up nicely, batsman sends that over the mid-wicket boundary. Fifty up"
1856,"out Bowled!! The googly is very effective against the lower-order batsmen. Third wicket and all three with the googly. batsman just swings through the line, misses the ball completely and has his sticks shattered. batsman b bowler 2(7)"
1857,"2 runs, in the airrrr, just short of the fielder, Tiwary it was. Looks like he didn't see the ball at the last moment and it crashes into his knee"
1858,"out Caught by (sub)Mayank Agarwal!! It's an easy ploy for a bowler on this pitch. When the batsman is looking to score big, all you have to do is take pace of the ball and ensure it's not too full. batsman sliced that drive with one hand, flew high over cover, the substitute fielder makes no mistake in the deep. batsman c (sub)Mayank Agarwal b bowler 55(48) [4s-4 6s-1]"
1859,"out Bowled!! bowler has struck early and it's a poor start for team once again! Lack of application did batsman there, on a length and angling back into the left-hander, batsman was rooted to his crease as he aimed a shovel over mid-wicket, gets an inside edge and the ball just clips the bails - the zing lights are up and team celebrate. batsman b bowler 2(5)"
1860,"FOUR, creamed, but that was poor fielding from Tahir, went down in a heap and ended up diving over the ball. On a good length and well outside off, batsman leans into the drive and finds the gap past cover. Tahir ran to his right and made a big mess of it"
1861,"FOUR, edged and four, width on offer from bowler, batsman's eyes lit up, threw the kitchen sink at that, gets a thick edge that races away through the vacant slip cordon"
1862,"FOUR, lovely, the best of the lot, it was a long half-volley from bowler, on batsman's pads, he presses across and flicks it in front of square on the on-side, the man in the deep has no chance"
1863,"FOUR, that's a good lofted drive, but team have won by a massive 61 runs. This will lift their net run rate by some margin. Is that it then for team? Maybe they still have an outside chance"
1864,"out Caught by Manoj Tiwary!! That's a big wicket for team, another failure for AB. Massive celebration, they know how big this wicket is. On a good length and just outside off, AB saw the width and creamed it off the back-foot - didn't bother to keep it down though - straight into the bucket hands of Tiwary at short extra-cover. He holds on and team have lost their second wicket. batsman c Manoj Tiwary b bowler 3(8)"
1865,"FOUR, nice way to get going, tad shorter and wider of off, Kedar is quick to rock back and pulls it high and over mid-on, a few bounces and over the ropes"
1866,"out batsman Run Out!! Kohli looks livid, but he has a part in this dismissal. Coming to the ball, it was short and wide from Ferguson, Kedar chopped it to the left of backward point. The fielder dived to his left and made a half-stop. That made Kohli set-off for a quick single before being sent back. The throw is at the bowler and he doesn't make a clean stop. The ball rolls away a few yards away from him, this makes Kedar think there's a run and he hares off - without even having a glance at his partner. Kohli was back to the action, by the time he turned around - he saw his partner near him. Ferguson throws the ball to his keeper who does the rest. batsman run out (bowler/Dhoni) 7(12) [4s-1]"
1867,"out Caught by Smith!! Kohli looks upset as another wicket falls down! Baby's comeback is brief and short. This was pushed through flatter and on his pads, Baby went back on the punch, hit it firmly but in the air - just about carried to mid-wicket where Smith slid forward and held on. He wasn't sure that it carried, but the soft call was OUT and it stayed with the original call. batsman c Smith b bowler 2(4)"
1868,"out Caught by Washington Sundar!! team are falling away, Vettori looks motionless in the dug-out! batsman falls to the short ball and his team have lost half their side now. Are they going to be the first team to be knocked out? The pressure of the dot balls consumed batsman here. This was a well directed short ball, batsman was beaten for pace as he looked to pull, gets a steepling top-edge, high and towards long leg. Sundar settles under it and holds on. batsman c Washington Sundar b bowler 1(7)"
1869,"SIX, looked a bit fidgety last over, but boy he has nailed this out of the screws. Underneath a flat delivery and he goes spank over mid-wicket"
1870,"FOUR, is quick to transfer his weight onto the back foot, and why? He spotted the length early, which is short, and smashed the cut behind point"
1871,"FOUR, tweaks a touch outside off, batsman goes with hard hands as he looks to go stright of mid-off/cover. Thick outside edge escapes past the keeper"
1872,"SIX, that's the shot of the game for me. Lovely use of the feet, comes dancing down towards the pitch of the ball and bulldozes it into the mid-wicket stands. Tonk!"
1873,"FOUR, thank you so much says batsman. Can't bowl there. On the pads, he gets his front leg away and bullies it behind square with sheer timing"
1874,"FOUR, errs on the other side now. Too much width outside off, batsman adjusts his bat angle to smack it in the gap between backward point and short third"
1875,"1 run, the 50-partnership up. Opens the bat face and guides a single down to third man"
1876,"out Caught by Milne!! How big a wicket is this? You just have to look at the celebrations in team camp. batsman throws his head down as he makes a long walk back to the pavilion. Shuffles and takes on the slower ball, looks for the pick-up hoick but gets it too low on the bat. In in the air and it gives ample time for deep square to settle under it. A slight fumble, but Milne had it covered. batsman c Milne b bowler 45(32) [4s-5 6s-1]"
1877,"FOUR, there you go! There's no stopping. MS knows when to fancy his chances, cross-seam delivery with lot of room on offer, he cashes on the the opportunity as he slashes the cut behind point"
1878,"FOUR, whack! Short ball angling into the body, Tiwary gets into good position and telegraphs the pull to the left of fine leg"
1879,"SIX, the 400th six of the tournament and it has come from MS. No fuss, just a touch outside his crease, picks the bones out of a half-volley and golf-swings it straight down the ground for a 80-plus metre maximum"
1880,"FOUR, streaky but Tiwary won't mind. The Chineese cut as they say. Full, dipping in around the blockhole area, Tiwary flashes hard and a smidge of inside edge does the trick for him. Skims past the leg-stump and rushes down to the fine leg fence"
1881,"FOUR, jumps down the pitch and looks to mow across the line. The bat face turns on impact and the leading edge runs wide of a diving short third. Much-needed boundary that"
1882,"FOUR, short ball and batsman takes full toll of it. Gets into a good position and smack the pull through mid-wicket"
1883,"FOUR, short ball at the body, batsman looks to pull and gets an inside edge that runs away into the fine leg fence. No chance for the man at 45"
1884,"out Caught by Milne!! There's the breakthrough! batsman perishes to a full toss. batsman wanted to sweep and gets a top edge that lobs up towards short fine leg. Milne, runs back, and gobbles it up with ease. batsman c Milne b bowler 6(8)"
1885,"FOUR, slightly overpitched and batsman puts it away! He gets low and slog sweeps it behind square leg. What an excellent shot to get off the mark"
1886,"SIX, wow! Welcome to Pune says batsman to bowler. Pitched up delivery on middle and leg, batsman sinks down on one knee and slogs it away over long-on"
1887,"FOUR, backs away and slashes the drive between cover and point. The ball races away into the fence. The batsman manufactured his own room"
1888,"FOUR, good looking shot. Jogs down the track, gets to the pitch and lofts it over mid-on. The man at deep mid-wicket runs across, but couldn't stop it"
1889,out Caught by Kedar Jadhav!!Edged and gone. Nothing great about this delivery. A wide delivery outside off that was there to be punished. The cut shot was on and batsman goes for it. All he manages is a faint top edge that is pocketed by the keeper. Kohli should be a relieved man. batsman c Kedar Jadhav b bowler 37(28) [4s-4 6s-1]
1890,"FOUR, nice way to get off the mark. Sliding in on the pads, Tiwary is quick to get low and sweep it fine. The ball has enough legs to dribble away past the boundary rope"
1891,"FOUR, aggression from the bowler, the batsman not one to back off. Goes for the hook on the short ball, the ball kisses the gloves and goes over the keeper for a four. Lucky is batsman"
1892,"SIX, full, on the sticks and Kaboom! That tailed in ever so faintly and batsman goes into overdrive mode. That was tonked over deep mid-wicket as the whirlwind of the hands took it high and handsome over the ropes"
1893,"FOUR, short ball, do I need to say more? batsman hangs back, allows the hands to do the talking and powers the cut uppishly past the point fielder for a four"
1894,"FOUR, comes dancing out of his crease, the length was music to him and slaps the ball down towards long-on for a one bounce four"
1895,"FOUR, fires it too wide of off, Jaddu makes full use of it. Just angles his bat down which takes some wood and races down to the third man fence"
1896,"out Caught by Pollard!! The pressure got to him! Kept running out of partners and now, decides to throw the kitchen sink against the wily old customer. Bhajji sees him coming down the wicket and aims wide of off, batsman had to fetch while not getting close to the pitch of the delivery, goes through with the loft and only succeeds in offering a dolly to KP, at long-off. batsman c Pollard b bowler 48(35) [4s-6 6s-2]"
1897,"FOUR, has liberty outside off and he frees his arms. Strokes the cut in the air and over backward point, third man can't get there"
1898,"out Caught&Bowled!! Jaddu throws it away. Should have showed some maturity with his team a travelling in troubled ship, not to be. Sinks to one knee, slog-sweeps from outside off and top-edges it high into the air. The bowler calls for it and accepts gleefully. Gujarat Lions sink further into the mire. batsman c and b bowler 28(21) [4s-2 6s-1]"
1899,"out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! The pandya brothers combination doing the trick for Mumbai Indians. batsman wanted to have a piece of Krunal, kneels down and attempts a slog-sweep, doesn't get all of it. Definitely not off the middle, it hovers in the air for a long, long time giving Hardik enough time to run in from deep mid-wicket and hold onto it. batsman c Hardik Pandya b bowler 2(3)"
1900,"FOUR, he is not hanging around, is he? Lines up for a full ball and when he gets one, he lauches bowler straight down the ground. Mid-off (running back) and long-on converge, in the process of stopping the ball they fear about the collision and lets it through"
1901,"FOUR, makes plenty of room outside off and smears bowler over extra cover. It was a slower ball that was bowled into the pitch which gave enough time for batsman to pick his spot"
1902,"SIX, short ball, Tye was ready for it. Is quick to stamp his weight onto the back foot and murders the pull over square leg"
1903,"SIX, slower ball, he has picked it again does batsman. Not quite off the middle, but he will take it, a 83-metre maximum. Doesn't make any shuffly movements, just keeps his head still and spanks the ball as hard as he can, into the long-off stands"
1904,"FOUR, bowls full and wide, Tye is seeing it like a hawk. Clears his front leg and clatters it square on the off-side"
1905,"FOUR, batsman wants to have some fun now. Picks the slower short ball and thumps it over mid-wicket, no-one in the deep"
1906,"out Andrew Tye Run Out!! A real waste of a wicket, but that's unfortunate. Nothing much batsman can do about it. A dipping full toss which batsman hits straight back to bowler who collects in his followthrough to run Tye out, can't back up that far. Andrew Tye run out (bowler) 25(12) [4s-2 6s-2]"
1907,"out Bowled!! Between his legs and uproots the leg peg. What.A.Sight. bowler finally gets his radar right as he springs this through batsman's legs. It dips and fizzes to defeat batsman's premeditated instincts, he was looking to flick it past 45, but makes no contact. batsman b bowler 21(27) [4s-2]"
1908,"1 run, Rana puts down a dolly. Full toss dished wide of off, Thampi slices the drive and chips straight to cover-point. Straight in and straight out"
1909,"out Bowled!! BMac misses, bowler hits. That was an ordinary slog and the bowler despite bowling length gets the big fish. Tried going across the line with the thwack and missed it completely. bowler punches the air in delight. team strike early. Second failure in succession for BMac. batsman b bowler 6(4) [4s-1]"
1910,"SIX, OOLLLLLAAAAALLLAA! That was a sizzler. Dropped short and the batsman camps back and pulls the ball away into the deep mid-wicket stands. That was powered, muscled and I can go on..."
1911,"FOUR, short and cut away now. Slight bit of room from bowler and the batsman hammers the cut to the right of the point fielder for a four"
1912,"FOUR, deft now! He has the bowler by his mercy. That was short, outside off and the batsman opens the face of the blade to guide it fine on the off-side. Third man was moved square after the last ball and had no chance"
1913,"SIX, perfect finish for the Lions, but Mumbai Indians will be the happier side. batsman gets underneath this half-volley and blazes it over long-off. Clean ball-striking!"
1914,"FOUR, Bhajji comes in, Bhajji is not going to be spared either. That was short again, hint of room and batsman jumps onto the cut to spear it away past the man at point"
1915,"FOUR, hangs back for the flighted short ball and then hacks it well past the man at mid-on for a four. He packs a punch in every shot"
1916,"out Caught by Pollard!! batsman comes a cropper today. That was a length ball and the batsman got cramped up, chipped it away and Pollard takes a good tumbling catch over his head. team have a body blow here. Their in-form skipper is gone. The batsman tried to back away a bit and then played the shot a bit too early. batsman c Pollard b bowler 1(3)"
1917,"out Bowled!! Back of a length delivery and the batsman drags it onto his sticks, after the ball tickled his body. That was another slower delivery I would believe and the batsman was through his shot a bit too early. bowler is back and how! Mumbai after a stutter against team have found their mojo back. batsman b bowler 0(3)"
1918,"wide, out Stumped!! Fast hands from PP does the trick. The ball fired down leg and the batsman missed his balance and stepped out of his crease. The rest was done by the glovesman as he didn't allow a whisker of a second for the batsman to come back. A wide for a wicket is loss of a bargain for the Lions. batsman st Parthiv Patel b bowler 2(8)"
1919,"SIX, he has his intentions clear! That has been swiped clean as a whistle. Knelt down and swept it big for a maximum"
1920,"FOUR, that's such a poor start from the bowler. Short and way outside off stump, Parthiv cuts easily over backward point"
1921,"FOUR, that's just a gentle flick, but this outfield is very fast. Beats the man giving chase from mid-on. Good length delivery on the leg stump, batsman doesn't try to over-hit the ball, placed it to the right of mid-on and opened his account"
1922,"FOUR, fine! Excellent start for team. Shuffles across a long way does batsman and helps this length ball on leg, down to the fine leg fence"
1923,"FOUR, in the air and in the gap! On a good length that swings away a tad, Parthiv presses forward and shows the full face of his bat as he drives uppishly. Gets it between mid-off and extra cover. The quick outfield does the rest"
1924,"FOUR, short and wide asking to be punished. Parthiv crashes the cut wide of backward point who takes some pace off the ball with a dive. The ball has enough legs to dribble away past the rope"
1925,"FOUR, ouch! Has Tye hurt himself badly there? A rank full toss from bowler. Parthiv pummels the slog through mid-wicket. Tye at deep mid-wicket sprints to his right and puts in an awkward dive. The ball deflects off his body and runs away into the fence. Has he done his shoulder there? Hope nothing is serious. He goes off the field"
1926,"FOUR, the PP show rolls on! Short ball and the batsman trampled back to smack the pull away towards the deep mid-wicket region"
1927,"FOUR, short ball outside off and the batsman opens the face of the bat to run it down past the man at short third man for a four. A despairing dive from Faulkner is not enough"
1928,out Caught by Karthik!! A faint tickle off the outer edge and Karthik makes easy amends for the fluffed chance earlier. This is RS's sixth single digit score in the year's IPL. That was just a seam up delivery angling away and batsman flirted at it to bring an end to his iffy knock. Is there a twist? batsman c Karthik b bowler 5(13)
1929,"FOUR, another edge, different result, elation previous, agony on this. That cut away from the right-hander, batsman edged it as he had a feel for it. The edge carried just past the diving tentacles of Karthik. Only if they had a slip"
1930,"1 run, DROPPED! Thampi at mid-wicket has tipped it over the bar! That was full on the pads and clipped by batsman and uppishly but it went straight to Thampi, who made a meal of it. Mumbai having some nervy moments here"
1931,out Caught by Karthik!! No Pollard but Parthiv's wicket do. A big fat birthday gift as the top-scorer of the game departs playing a needless dab. Went for a fish outside off and ended up netting himself. Karthik leaped up and grabbed that out of thin air with aplomb. Can team roar back into this? batsman c Karthik b bowler 70(44) [4s-9 6s-1]
1932,"FOUR, length ball and that has been dragged down the ground with powerful sinews. The ball landed close to the man at mid-off and then raced away into the fence for a four. A much needed relief for team"
1933,"FOUR, length ball sits up for the batsman to hack the pull away and loft it over mid-wicket. The man at long-on was light years away from that"
1934,out Caught by Brendon McCullum!! Clips the drive hard and finds the man at long-on. That was a needless hit. It was in the over-pitched zone and the batsman wanted to tonk it over the long-on region but failed to get enough elevation on it. The boundary rider at long-on - BMac cups it easily. batsman c Brendon McCullum b bowler 15(11) [4s-2]
1935,"1 run, Raina, Oh Raina! Almost plucks out a blinder out of thin air. That was hoicked away on the on-side and the man at mid-wicket leaped up with his right hand flicking the ball over him. That was a very tough chance"
1936,"FOUR, goes for the slog, the ball chalks the inner meatier part of the bat and that is enough to send it away from the diving long-on fielder. BMac gave it a valiant chase and dived full stretched to his left but the ball landed away from him and went over the fence. That four has helped things for team"
1937,"out Caught by Ishan Kishan!! Looks to go big on the on-side. Was it needed? He holes out at deep mid-wicket as Kishan gobbles that up. More twist in this gripping contest. That was full and the batsman tried to get undeneath it, but failed to scale substantial distance on it. batsman c Ishan Kishan b bowler 4(5)"
1938,out Lbw!! Michael Clarke called it on air. He wanted bowler to go full and straight. bowler does exactly that. The finger went up slowly. Bhajji goes for a first baller. That was an inswinging full ball. The ball thudded onto the pad and the rest was easy for the ump. batsman lbw b bowler 0(1)
1939,"out batsman Run Out!! 1 run completed. Lot of action on that. A scoop landed on the half-volley for the man at deep fine to stop it with his body. Then he gets up, hurls the throw and scores a direct-hit at the striker's end as both batsmen wanted a couple. Irfan gets into the action at a crucial time and has given team a lifeline. batsman run out (Irfan Pathan) 1(1)"
1940,"SIX, that should seal it! Full and in the zone and the batsman whistled the ball away into thin air for a maximum straight down the ground. That was a poor delivery, they should have opted for Jadeja"
1941,"out batsman Run Out!! Has Jadeja got batsman with a direct hit? I feel he has. Yes, OUT in RED. Dabbed the ball away into the off-side and looked for a single. Jadeja came in from point and had a shy at the bowler's end. The bullseye was hit. And team have another lifeline. batsman run out (Jadeja) 0(1)"
1942,"FOUR, bangs it in short without any venom behind it. Patel gets into a good position and pulls it behind square on the leg-side"
1943,"SIX, even better! Short ball that sits up nicely for Parthiv to play the pull shot. He is a short man, but isn't afraid to play shots like that. Pummels it over deep mid-wicket"
1944,"out Krunal Pandya Run Out!! That was a yorker, tailed back in, hit the boot and lobbed away to point. Jadeja roared in, missiled in the throw and found the dive from Krunal Pandya short. A full length pool dive also doesn't do it. The third umpire saw one replay to give his verdict. Fourth direct hit. All southpaws. They have fielded a lifeline for themselves. Krunal Pandya run out (Jadeja) 29(20) [4s-2 6s-1]"
1945,"FOUR, 16 off bowler's first over in IPL 2017. He errs in line drifting down leg, Parthiv moves across and helps it away behind square on the leg-side. The ball races away into the fence. team are off to a flier"
1946,"out Buttler Run Out!! Suicidal running between the wickets. Buttler walks off the field shaking his head. That should have been his response to Parthiv after the stroke was completed. It was a half-tracker outside off, Parthiv goes deep in his crease and cuts it to the left of point. Faulkner dives to his left to stop that. Gets up quickly and hits the target direct at the striker's end. Buttler was OUT by a mile. Buttler run out (Faulkner) 9(7) [4s-2]"
1947,"SIX, this guy is a positive batsman. What a wonderful way to get off the mark. Sinks low on one knee and smacks the slog sweep over deep backward square leg"
1948,"FOUR, cheekiness at its best! Knuckle ball from Tye well outside off. The ball almost went past him, and Parthiv opens his bat face at the very last instant. The ball runs away into the third man fence"
1949,"1 run, a nudge towards backward square leg for a single with which batsman brings up his fifty! Just a raise of bat"
1950,"FOUR, too much width and Rana punishes him. The back-spinner, Rana crouches and lifts it inside out over cover for a boundary. That's Raina-esque"
1951,"out Lbw!! batsman isn't happy as he walks off. Not sure about what - the decision or the selection of shot. It was tossed up delivery. Rana gets down and goes for the reverse sweep. He is struck in front of middle. Ah! The replays show that there was glove involved there. So, that was the reason behind his disappointment. batsman lbw b bowler 19(16) [4s-1 6s-1]"
1952,"out Caught by Saha!! Edged and caught! The perfect start for team, a nothing shot from batsman and he has to take the long walk back to the hut. Sandeep shortened his length outside off and got the ball to shape away slightly, drew batsman into playing at that. He was looking to run it down towards third man, gets a thick edge and it's an easy catch to the keeper. batsman' comeback is a short one, the Daredevils have been rocked early. batsman c Saha b bowler 0(2)"
1953,"SIX, lovely shot, much needed blow for the Daredevils - but they need plenty of thse more. Came down the track, doesn't get too close to the ball, allows him to free his arms - plays with the turn and deposits the ball way into the stands at long-on"
1954,"FOUR, handy boundary for batsman, comes down the track, gets close to the ball and drills it back over his partner's head, a couple of bounces and over the ropes"
1955,"out Bowled!! This doesn't help the Daredevils one bit! bowler strikes with his first ball as well, this was full and just outside off, Anderson went with hard hands on the drive, the feet went nowhere and the inside edge clattered back onto the stumps. He was their last hope to get past 100 and DD are now struggling for the final push. batsman b bowler 18(25) [6s-1]"
1956,"no run, chance and dropped. Shaun Marsh is the culprit, he had two bites at the cherry, but can't hold on. Length delivery outside off, batsman drilled it towards cover, Marsh tumbled to his right and let the ball slip, he was alert though, turned around and tried to grab the rebound, but can't do so. He had it for a moment, but the ball popped out as his elbows hit the ground"
1957,"out Caught by Shaun Marsh!! Another chance for Marsh and this time he holds on, DD's procession continues. On a good length and on the stumps, batsman was leaning forward on the lofted drive, the bat turned as he made contact, ends up mistiming it high and towards long-on. Marsh has a long time to settle under it and gobbles it up, fourth wicket for Sandeep and he's having quite an evening. batsman c Shaun Marsh b bowler 11(20) [4s-1]"
1958,"out Caught by Sandeep Sharma!! Dravid looks distraught in the dug-out as another batsman self combusts. Can't blame batsman though, DD needed some quick runs, but there's nothing coming today. This was short and wide of off, asking to be smacked. batsman had the right idea, he was looking to crack it over point, but the execution went all awry. Ends up getting too underneath the ball and flat-bats it in the air, Sandeep circled around the skier from cover. Thought about going reverse cupped, decides against it and takes it in the normal way. batsman c Sandeep Sharma b bowler 2(4)"
1959,"out Caught&Bowled!! DD have been bundled out for their lowest score in IPL - the 10th edition is bringing in some unwanted records for teams. First it was team - now it's the DD. Slower ball from Mohit, batsman didn't read it at all, popped his bat forward, closed the face on the tuck, got a leading edge and it's an absolute dolly to the bowler. Not sure if the Mohali crowd enjoyed the show from DD - you don't want to watch a mismatch after having paid big money for the tickets. batsman c and b bowler 0(1)"
1960,"FOUR, nicely played by batsman, that should get him going, fraction short and wide of off, he leans forward, plays with a flat-bat and gets it in the gap - wide of extra-cover"
1961,"out Caught by Mohit Sharma!! Sandeep has two now and the Daredevils have lost both openers. On a good length and a hint of shape away from outside off, batsman took a step down the track and was looking to work it towards the on-side, closed the bat-face early, gets a thick leading edge - high and towards mid-off. A simple grab by Mohit and Delhi find themselves in early trouble. batsman c Mohit Sharma b bowler 5(14) [4s-1]"
1962,"FOUR, lovely shot, overpitched and wide outside off, Shreyas leans forward, meets the ball on top of the bounce and drives it crisply past cover, no one moved"
1963,"SIX, cracking shot, banged in short and just outside off, Karun was early into the pull and nailed it high and in front of square on the on-side, went soaring over the ropes for a maximum"
1964,"out Caught&Bowled!! That's a spectacular return catch from Sandeep, but Shreyas isn't going anywhere. The third umpire has been called for and the soft signal is OUT. That's as clean as one gets, the decision remains OUT. The Mohali crowd go bonkers as their southern neighbours lose another. Credit must go to the bowler here, he was on his followthrough, bent down low, went with his left hand and pouched a beauty. Coming to the ball, it was a short of a good length delivery outside off, might have stopped on the batsman. Shreyas was early into the drive, went low off the bat and to the left of Sandeep. He moved across on his followthrough, with one-handed and the ball stuck, made sure that it didn't pop out when his elbows hit the ground. batsman c and b bowler 6(7) [4s-1]"
1965,"out Bowled!! bowler has struck first ball and it's been a free-fall for the Daredevils. This was the quicker ball from bowler, pitched on off and went straight on, Karun was playing for a bit of turn, ended up playing inside the line and missed it completely. The ball curled past the outside edge and crashed into the off-stump, Karun looks back in dismay and walks off. DD are in a heap of trouble now. batsman b bowler 11(10) [6s-1]"
1966,"out Lbw!! The lovely drift of bowler has accounted for yet another young Indian batsman. He came from round the wicket, got this one to slide one with the angle, batsman was playing down the wrong line, ended up pushing his bat outside the line of the delivery, gets beaten on ths inside edge and is rapped right in front. The impact was in front of middle-stump, at worst, would have been crashing into leg. Easy call for the umpire and DD continue to slump. batsman lbw b bowler 3(6)"
1967,"out Caught&Bowled!! That's another soft dismissal and DD are seriously threatening team's score of 49. Catching practice for bowler, this was pushed through slower and just outside off, Morris rocked back on the punch, might have gone through with the shot a bit too early, lobs a simple return catch to the bowler - he accepts the gift with glee and Morris walks away in disgust. batsman c and b bowler 2(5)"
1968,"FOUR, batsman and Punjab are away. Takes a step forward, manufactures his own room and thrashes it over cover. Kings XI anthem blares in the background"
1969,"FOUR, batsman is in a hurry here. Wasting no time as he backs away to this back of a length delivery and bullies it through the packed off-side field. Not so productive start for bowler and DD"
1970,"FOUR, classic shot from batsman. Just a soft push from the crease to this full toss and it roars away to the fence. Beats extra cover, minimum effort there from the mighty Hash!"
1971,"FOUR, cheeky and effective for batsman. Cleverly arches his back on seeing this short ball outside off, opens his bat face and elevates it over first slip. One bounce and into the fence"
1972,"FOUR, ooh, he didn't time it as he would've liked but still earns himself a boundary. A dipping low full toss from bowler, batsman miscued it as he dragged it off the cue-end. Squirts it over mid-off and off it goes away to the fence"
1973,"SIX, batsman is in overdrive. Wants to capitalise on the powerplay. Stays a bit leg-sidish, loads up big time and smacks it with lot of power to send it soaring into the long-on stands"
1974,"FOUR, raining boundaries off batsman's willow. Again moves away to leg-side, takes on this back of a length delivery and blasts it wide of mid-on. He didn't find the sweet spot but it doesn't matter anyway"
1975,"FOUR, bowler's radar goes haywire. Spills it on the pads, easy pickings for batsman as he gets inside the line and flicks it past the man at 45"
1976,"1 run, full and on the stumps, batsman makes room and drills it hard towards mid-on. 50-up for Punjab in no time"
1977,"SIX, he is greeted to the crease with a maximum. Slips in a googly, on a shortish length, batsman picks it up and clubs it way back into the mid-wicket stands"
1978,"SIX, wow. Massive strike from batsman. Bends low on seeing this tossed up, gets into good position and smokes it over deep mid-wicket. Scores are level now"
1979,"1 run, game, set and match - Punjab. What a way to finish the game. batsman lowers his center of gravity and sweeps it through square leg. He raises his fifty as well. Punjab win by 10 wickets"
1980,"FOUR, ends up being a short on the legs of batsman, who whips it from there. Through square leg and into the fence. Not quite timed but fetches him a four"
1981,"FOUR, low full toss and batsman cracks it past mid-off to bring his second four of the over. The idea from bowler was to bowl a yorker but could not control it there"
1982,"out Caught by Warner!! That will hurt. team needed batsman to fire, he does not. Makes room to this short ball and for some odd reason does not go full throttle with the cut. The ball might have held a bit on the pitch, mistimed to the right of Warner at extra cover. Good running catch from the centurion. batsman c Warner b bowler 1(4)"
1983,"out Caught&Bowled!! How good is bowler? Pandey was walking into a chip-drive through mid-on say, Kumar bowls a cutter and has Pandey prodding at the ball way too early. Result: a chip back down to bowler, who tips it up in the air off his fingertips and then holds onto the rebound like a man who knows what he's doing. batsman c and b bowler 39(29) [4s-3]"
1984,"SIX, goodness gracious. Spots the bowler rolling his fingers across and delays his slog over mid-wicket, bruting the ball way over for a maximum"
1985,"SIX, that's a half-baked bouncer. At half the pace it should have been, so the shortish length is all too easy to deal with. batsman clubs it over cow corner with utter disdain. Gets to his fifty, another one this season"
1986,"out Caught by Warner!! Caught at long-off. This is a big wicket, make no mistake about that. And brought about by a man coming into the side today. Nicely done. Preempts the fact that batsman is going for his shots, bowls it short and wide - taking a leaf out from Bhuvi's last over - and has batsman toe-end the forehand slap kinda shot to Warner in the deep. Simplest of catches that; bowler completely undid him with lack of pace. batsman c Warner b bowler 53(28) [4s-4 6s-4]"
1987,"FOUR, good shot. Looked pretty. Was bowled full and wide, batsman had made the room early but inclines his weight across, pinned on his front foot, and smothers the drive through covers. 92 off 36"
1988,"out Caught by S Kaul!! Gets a wicket off the last ball of his spell and will finish with 1/38. A ball slightly on the shorter length - Rashid has been bowling that all day today - and the length, for once, has Yusuf in a mess. Decides very late to play at it, gives it a good hoick but top-edges it straight - and when I say 'straight', I mean it - to backward point. Game's done. Yawn.[/b] batsman c S Kaul b bowler 12(13)"
1989,"FOUR, a certain bowler Kumar yorker that's becoming famous by the day, quite beating his physique. Slightly leg-sidish and Grandhomme gets just enough tickle on this. Through fine leg. Boundary"
1990,"SIX, nah. Drops it short, batsman looked ready and hammers the pull into the stands. Way over the ropes. Lovely, lovely hit"
1991,"out Caught by Rashid Khan!! Four singles in a row and bam, we have a wicket. Times have changed. Rotating strike is no longer enough. Bhuvi tries his luck with the shorter length again but takes the pace off, which is the reason why batsman clubs it straight to Rashid at deep mid-wicket. batsman c Rashid Khan b bowler 16(17) [4s-1]"
1992,"FOUR, uses the width on this cutter and cleverly steers it wide of backward point. In between the two fielders and gets a boundary. team will lose by 4 less now"
1993,"out Caught by Rashid Khan!! And with that team's hopes suffer another dent. Good judgement there from the team fielders. This mistimed pull from batsman went high in the air towards mid-wicket. There were at least three fielders in the vicinity, but they communicated well among themselves and it was the Afghan spinner who called for it, eventually taking it reverse-cupped. batsman c Rashid Khan b bowler 11(11) [4s-2]"
1994,"out Caught by Rashid Khan!! Sunrisers Hyderabad make it five in five at home this season. A wicket to end the match, quite fittingly. Dropped slow on a length, Colin batsman wanted a picture-perfect finish but finds a teenager at long-off. All done. The table-toppers have been tamed. batsman c Rashid Khan b bowler 18(15) [4s-1 6s-1]"
1995,"FOUR, bit cross-batted but as long as they fetch runs. Got across to this length delivery and whipped between the man at mid-on and mid-wicket. Bhuvi with a chase there but soon realised it was only going to be a futile one. Kaul didn't like it one bit. Has a few words to say to which Robbie responds"
1996,"FOUR, that is a sonorous sound off the bat, not for the bowler of course. Is not that full around off, but batsman trusts the pace and drives on the up, past cover and into the fence in no time"
1997,"FOUR, he's played the field there. So aware of the men around him. The slip is wide and the third man is not covering for him. Uses the pace and opens the face of the bat to bisect the keeper and Williamson"
1998,"FOUR, and that is what you get for keeping the bat straight. Uncomplicated stuff, hits the on-drive to this length ball on the up and leaves mid-on redundant"
1999,"FOUR, majestic! Half-volley this time but Pandey knew where the field was, hit the straight drive in the air but past the bowler. Is so straight that long-on does not stand a chance to his right"
2000,"FOUR, not sure how well that was timed but it manages to beat Warner to the fence. Pandey once again backed away in the crease and to his liking got a shortish ball. A cross-batted whip beat the man at mid-on first, before Warner gave up running across from deep mid-wicket"
2001,"SIX, if one shot could be included in the wikipedia page of 'power', this is it. 101 metres from batsman. Slogs across the line and puts a lot of flesh on it to send it over the deep mid-wicket fence. Was hit with the turn, yes a googly it was"
2002,"SIX, this is the second time batsman has slogged across the line off bowler. And like the previous occasion makes good connection again, sending it deep into the stands at deep mid-wicket"
2003,"FOUR, the previous shot forces bowler to pitch it short and batsman makes merry. Goes back and pulls it straight down the ground"
2004,"FOUR, bowler overpitches looking for swing, but it's not moving. batsman lofts over the infield, the bat turned in hands, but made good enough contact to clear the man at mid-off. That gets the crowd going, first boundary of the game. 1000 runs for Davey batsman at Uppal"
2005,"SIX, that's just just missed the sightscreen. This is a good batting surface to hit through the line. You can't bowl full if it's not swinging, batsman bends his knees and gets under it, smashed over mid-off. First maximum of the night"
2006,"SIX, wowww! This is some hitting. Spare a thought for the bowler. Kuldeep bowled a full delivery looking for some spin, batsman gets down on one knee and slogs it over long-on"
2007,"2 runs, Davey batsman rushes for the second and there is that Mario jump from the little man. What a knock. It's a 43-ball 100. The helmet comes off and the arms are aloft in joy. A special effort indeed. He's single-handedly manhandled the visitors. This is an inswinging yorker on the leg stump, clipped to mid-wicket and he was quick to rush back for the second. Right then, can he beat Gayle's 175? If he carries on, he certainly can"
2008,"FOUR, now batsman gets a boundary. Short and on the stumps, batsman pulls it through mid-wicket and beats the fielder in the deep"
2009,"out batsman Run Out!! End of a 139-run stand. They needed a run-out to break this lethal partnership because nothing was working for team. Credit to Kuldeep for having the presence of mind to target the sticks at the bowler's end. This was a short slower delivery on the stumps, batsman mistimes the pull uppishly to short fine leg, Warner raced across to get back on strike, batsman was late to take off. Kuldeep took his time, took aim and hit the bullseye. batsman run out (Kuldeep Yadav) 29(30) [4s-2 6s-1]"
2010,"FOUR, clever shot from batsman. Spotted that long-off was inside the ring, picked the slower ball, went back and lofted that nicely over the top for a boundary"
2011,"FOUR, in the airrr, Pandey dives full length to his right at long-off and gets a hand on it. Excellent effort. Flighted delivery from bowler, batsman smashed it down the ground"
2012,"FOUR, he's picking the spots so well. Was cramped for room, backed away and managed to loft it over cover"
2013,"FOUR, the carnage continues, flighted delivery down the leg-side, batsman sweeps, past the diving fielder at short fine leg for four"
2014,"out Caught by Gambhir!! bowler gets his man after missing those two chances. But take a moment to stand and applaud this man. Great to see many team players go up to batsman and congratulate him for his knock. Slower delivery on the stumps, batsman goes for the slog, mistimes it completely, the ball goes high in the air towards cover. Gambhir settles under it, the ball almost pops out of his hands but he manages to hold on. The crowd give their skipper a grand ovation. So Gayle's 175 is safe! batsman c Gambhir b bowler 126(59) [4s-10 6s-8]"
2015,"FOUR, that's lovely placement from batsman. Another full toss from bowler, batsman doesn't try to over-hit the ball, lofts the drive over cover and beats sweeper cover"
2016,"FOUR, that movement across the stumps was playing on the bowler's mind, he tried to bowl full and wide outside off stump again, batsman stays put, lofts handsomely to the right of mid-off"
2017,"FOUR, how did he manage to hit that so well. Good slower ball bouncer, batsman got into an awkward position to scoop that, went through with that shot and it bounced inside the rope"
2018,"FOUR, cheeky from Kane! Moved right across the stumps and paddled that, didn't middle it, got a bit of an edge, but that was good enough, short fine leg had no chance. 200 up for Hyderabad"
2019,"1 run, dropped, easy chance. NCN almost killed the fielder with that stare. Sheldon Jackson it was. Shortish and on the leg stump, batsman flicks in a whippy manner, Jackson ran to his left slightly and covered the distance nicely, looked like he'd easily catch it but it popped out"
2020,"3 runs, oh dearrrr! Chris Woakes makes a mess of it. Tough chance though. So lucky is Davey batsman here. This was a shortish slower ball from Umesh, batsman wanted to pull, totally mistimed it, the ball went high in the air over mid-on, Woakes runs back, seems to have misjudged and the ball already eluded him. Even a full length dive wasn't good enough. Hyderabad will breathe a big sigh of relief"
2021,"FOUR, that is class for you! Certainly not all that a bad ball, but batsman's in the mood. Short of a length, just outside off stump, so he had to manufacture a bit of space for himself to be able to cut that ball. He jumps and then backs away slightly to cut it away to the right of backward point"
2022,"SIX, the skipper wants to make it big today. Such a lovely shot this. English length from bowler. Sits up nicely, on a good length and on the stumps, this is a batting belter, at least with the new ball, so the bowler's got to be clever. batsman gets inside the line and just picks it up to send it over the long leg boundary"
2023,"out Williamson Run Out!! 1 run completed. What was batsman Singh doing there? Could have attempted the second run, instead puts his arm up, Kane was halfway down the pitch and had no chance. Didn't take the first run briskly and that is why Yuvi said no. Every run is important in this form of the game. Games are won and lost even by a margin of 1 run. Looked like he never was keen for the second. Yorker on the stumps, batsman flicks into the vacant mid-wicket region, could have been two if he was a little quicker, the bowler had to run all the way to mid-wicket, he did well to fire an accurate throw to the keeper. Williamson run out (bowler/Uthappa) 40(25) [4s-5]"
2024,"SIX, now then, now then! That was a shot to make a statement. National selectors, please note. How hard did he hit that? Walked slightly across the line, expectedly got the slower ball and muscled that over the mid-wicket boundary. How poor was bowler to opt for a slower ball for the fourth successive time?"
2025,"FOUR, fine leg is inside the ring and batsman gets across the stumps to pull it over the man at 45"
2026,"FOUR, this is poor bowling, but that is what batsman can do! When he is in such a murderous mood, the bowler is afraid to bowl full, it's a short ball again, batsman knew what was coming, went back and cut it away over cover-point"
2027,"SIX, this has gone all the way over the mid-wicket boundary. The bowler needs to show a bit of courage here and not just bowl short all the time. Got to fancy his chances too. batsman slogs and the connection is very good"
2028,"2 runs, change of angle and finally a ball in the fuller length, batsman tucks it through mid-wicket, a fumble and the third run was on, but Dhawan was not ball-watching"
2029,"SIX, it's a 20-ball fifty for Davey batsman, what entertainment from the Aussie. Greets bowler in grand style. This was the normal offie on the stumps, batsman was early into position for the switch-hit and he sent that over the square third man fence. Raise of the bat to acknowledge all the applause. Joint-fastest fifty by a team player in IPL"
2030,"FOUR, he's pierced that gap so well. Shortish and spinning away outside off stump, batsman cuts well and sends it between cover and cover-point. He wants to make the most of this powerplay"
2031,"FOUR, different bowler and batsman takes him on this time. Not the ideal start from Kuldeep, dropped it way too short, gave batsman enough time to camp back and smash it over mid-on"
2032,"FOUR, the switch-hit again and the backward point boundary is free. Bit of a top-edge from batsman, but the ball escaped. He doesn't want to allow the bowler to settle"
2033,"1 run, yes-no, but all is well in the end. The wrong' un from Kuldeep, batsman defends towards backward point and sets off, slight hesitation, but Dhawan was rushing towards the striker's end, the throw should have gone to the bowler"
2034,"SIX, wowww! What a shot. No lapse in concentration even after the break. Umesh errs in his length, slightly short in length, batsman muscles the pull hard over mid-wicket and the bat made a sweet sound as it made contact with the ball"
2035,"SIX, what a way to bring up the century partnership. NCN went short with this slower delivery, but batsman got the placement right. There was a man at deep mid-wicket and it went at a catchable height, but he hit it to his right"
2036,"FOUR, have seen him practice those switch-hits in the training, it's coming out so well. Careful Davey, don't let the rule-makers take notice and force a rule change. This is smashed through point"
2037,"SIX, dropped and it's Woakes again. He misjudged one in the second over off batsman, now he's palmed this over the long-off rope. This was an easy catch. Shake of the head. Has already cost the team around 80 runs at least. Shortish and outside off stump, batsman hit that off the back foot, didn't get the distance, but the fielder misjudges the catch"
2038,"out Caught by Chahal!! This is just the start team wanted. It's a golden duck for Parthiv. Kohli must have had some strong words in the huddle before they walked out and he'd be delighted with this start. Parthiv had a good last match, he tried to be positive first up in this game but this short of length delivery got big on him. Mistimed pull, went off the splice of the bat, Chahal did well to dive forward from short mid-wicket. He slid on those practice pitches but held on to the ball. batsman c Chahal b bowler 0(1)"
2039,"FOUR, freebie and Rana won't miss out. He's a man in form. Kohli would not want his bowlers to bowl such balls. On the pads, easy glance to the fine leg fence. First boundary for the hosts"
2040,"FOUR, did that carry? No it didn't! Kohli is not happy as the ball escaped for four. The fielder didn't do much wrong there. He went for the catch and it landed just in front him. Rana swept uppishly towards backward square leg and got away with it"
2041,"FOUR, poor delivery! This is a pressure-releaser. Short and wide outside off stump, really poor delivery, batsman cuts uppishly to the left of backward point and third man had no chance"
2042,"FOUR, turns out to be a 12-run over, just what team wanted to get that momentum back. On the leg stump was the slower delivery, no one at fine leg and a gentle glance was all that was required"
2043,"FOUR, batsman gets a boundary but the bowler won the mini battle there, the batsman stepped out, was the googly, batsman went through with the swing, mistimed it but managed to place it to the right of long-on"
2044,"out Caught by Head!! bowler's got his man. He almost had batsman when he managed to hit that mistimed boundary, but this time the batsman has found the fielder. They check for the no-ball, but bowler just escapes. By a centimetre or so. This is certainly not an easy wicket to bat on against the slower bowlers. It's stopping on the batsman or gripping the surface when the length isn't too full. batsman stepped out and flicked, no timing and straight to deep mid-wicket. batsman c Head b bowler 17(13) [4s-2]"
2045,"FOUR, that's nicely played. Full and well outside off stump, batsman waits for the ball to come and square-drives it past backward point"
2046,"FOUR, oh what a shot! Aniket over pitches this full delivery, batsman leans forward and drives hard through cover, Chahal dives to his right and gets a hand on it, yet the ball comfortably reached the fence"
2047,"FOUR, smashed straight down the ground, can Kohli get there? He can but in trying to pull it back, doesn't deflect it back inside the playing area. It was too full and batsman knelt down to hit that back over the bowler"
2048,"FOUR, Chahal at extra cover gave that up very easily. But that was timed so beautifully by batsman. A back foot punch with a high backlift, hitting the ball on the top of its bounce, the weight going into the shot and powered away. Great start to the over"
2049,"out Caught by Milne!! bowler has his right fist raised in triumph. After getting batsman. Short ball on the stumps, batsman didn't do enough on the pull and Milne took it over his head at deep square. Just a bit more and that would be six. Kohli is happy as well. A much needed wicket for team. batsman c Milne b bowler 9(8) [4s-1]"
2050,"SIX, and the last ball has cost 7. Could well cost team the match as well. A nothing short ball, around waist high and batsman has muscled the pull flat into the deep square stands. Looks like he was waiting for the short one, bowler didn't get any shoulder or height on that, Kohli is not happy at all. Suddenly now the equation looks easy"
2051,"SIX, brilliant. Just brilliant. batsman knows that it will be on a length and slower, knows that it will be majorly outside off as well, so what does he do? Shuffles across and delectably plays a half sweep, yes a sweep, that sails into the unmanned deep square fence. Didn't look like carrying all the way, but it was a flat hit"
2052,"1 run, fifty for batsman. He tries to cut this into the off-side, chops it towards backward point. Been an excellent innings. Absorbed the pressure, didn't take too many risks and has almost taken his side home"
2053,"FOUR, team win! batsman does it for his team. No big celebrations. Just a big smile and then a hug with Hardik Pandya. Low full toss as bowler missed the yorker, thumped wide of extra cover and mid-off was inside the ring as well. Raced away and team have done the double over team this season - but it must be said that the Kohli-led side had chances to win both games. 8th loss for team out of 11 this year. team go top of the table"
2054,"FOUR, that's nicely played. Didn't try to over-hit the ball, flighted delivery outside off stump, Rana leans forward and drives along the ground, beats AB's dive to his right at mid-off"
2055,"FOUR, batsman loves pace on the ball. He's at ease when he plays the fast bowlers. bowler went full searching for swing, but went as a juicy half-volley, batsman drives it to the right of extra-cover and it raced away"
2056,"FOUR, now bowler bangs it short, this is not a WACA to trouble batsmen with bounce, sits up nicely, batsman stands tall and doesn't bother to keep the ball along the ground as he pulls through mid-wicket"
2057,"2 runs, uppish, Aniket is tested again and he comes second in the race. Lucky escape for Rana. This was a shortish delivery on the leg stump, Rana tried to work it on the on-side, got a leading edge that flew high, deep square leg and short fine leg tried to hunt, but the ball beat the outstretched arm of the latter"
2058,"FOUR, how well has he timed that? This is the second time the ball has gone past a diving AB de Villiers. Short of a length delivery outside off stump, batsman plays a back foot drive, plays it to the left of cover and it escaped across the turf. This is a fast start from Mumbai, despite a first-ball wicket"
2059,"FOUR, wow! Lovely drive, bowler bowls a full ball, didn't swing, Rana leant into the drive and placed it to the right of mid-on. Moves into the 20s"
2060,"FOUR, overpitched and batsman goes aerial. Just cleared his front leg a bit and lofted through the line, well wide of mid-off and on the bounce for four"
2061,"SIX, the idea was right from bowler to flight the ball to the Englishman, but when it's too full, the ball hardly has any distance to spin on the batsman. batsman moves his left leg out of the way and smashes it high over the mid-wicket boundary"
2062,"out Caught by Head!! A really soft dismissal and you can tell that from batsman's reaction. Just wanted to throw that bat away. He was well set and looking good, the introduction of the left-arm spinner does the trick. Not a wicket taking delivery, but you do get wickets in this manner in T20 cricket. Flighted delivery outside off stump, batsman steps out and drives inside-out, doesn't control the shot, hits it straight to cover. Can team work on this opening? batsman c Head b bowler 33(21) [4s-4 6s-1]"
2063,"FOUR, batsman has seen enough of this good length stuff from bowler. Decides to score a boundary, plays across the line and chips it over mid-wicket, splits deep mid-wicket and long-on to perfection"
2064,"out Caught by Head!! bowler continues to have a good match. 30 odd runs and now two wickets. With the left-arm spinner on, mid-wicket is an easy area to target for a left-hander as he can hit with the spin, Rana went for the big slog-sweep, seemed to have got it on the outside half of the bat. Head was close to the rope at deep mid-wicket. Took the catch, the momentum was taking him beyond the boundary. Released the ball before crossing over and recovered quickly to grab it again. batsman c Head b bowler 27(28) [4s-4]"
2065,"FOUR, batsman is off the mark first ball. But with a boundary. Width outside off, crashed wide of cover-point and on this outfield, no-one is stopping that. Nice shot as he freed his arms"
2066,"FOUR, a mistimed pull, but four. Over square leg. The length wasn't there for the shot, but batsman muscled that, got it off the splice of the bat but managed to clear the square leg umpire"
2067,"FOUR, Anil Kumar Chaudhary has a wry smile on his face. Because bowler was appealing for an lbw. The umpire spotted the tickle. A slower ball yorker from bowler that dips on the batsman, bowler's trademark weapon. But batsman picked that and got it wide of short fine inside the ring"
2068,"FOUR, one bounce over the ropes at wide long-on. batsman against the left-arm spinner is always advantage to the batsman. He kneels down and slogs it into the gap. Did well to hit it wide of Pollard"
2069,"out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! Now finds deep mid-wicket. A drag down and somehow batsman has contrived to find the man. Another soft, soft dismissal. Could've and should've hit it to the stands, but walks away gifting his wicket. bowler gets a wicket off a delivery which wasn't great by any means. But he won't be complaining. batsman c Hardik Pandya b bowler 12(15) [4s-1]"
2070,"1 run, nudged to short fine leg, batsman is ambling along. Taking it easy. Had Bumrah hit direct, he would've been walking back. Not a wise decision that, and especially when your captain is Kohli. Very poor from batsman"
2071,"FOUR, sees the tossed up delivery and is onto that in a flash. Skips down and blasts it straight down the ground. Clean strike and went the distance"
2072,"SIX, great shot. Walks across his stumps, gets outside off and then sweeps it almost into the first tier. Sailed a long way into the deep backward square stands. Is that the strike that gets him back into his fearsome best? Let's wait and watch"
2073,"out Caught by Bumrah!! No. No. That's what the team fans and their faithful will be shouting and screaming now. There goes bowler, showing four fingers to the cameras and then signalling a boundary - which implies that he has got batsman out four times in the IPL. After hitting the six, batsman tried to repeat the shot, a little shimmy outside leg to try and unsettle bowler, who kept his cool and fired it on leg, then batsman came back into line, but since the ball came to him quickly, by the time he was down for the slog sweep, it was late, the top edge is found and Bumrah won't drop that at short fine leg. Too easy that one. And then bowler's celebrations start. Yet another team batsmen has flattered to deceive today. This time it is AB. And all this regular wickets won't do the side any good at all. bowler has a tale to tell his grandchildren one day. batsman c Bumrah b bowler 43(27) [4s-3 6s-3]"
2074,out Bowled!! Dreadful from batsman. Looks to swipe a top of middle ball to leg and misses. No conviction nor was it a high percentage shot. The ball doesn't do anything except follow its straight line path and clatters into the top of off and middle. Very poor from such an experienced campaigner. batsman b bowler 3(5)
2075,"FOUR, fabulous whip off the pads. Drifting into middle, a length delivery and batsman used his strong forearms to power it away, beats deep mid-wicket's desperate dive"
2076,"SIX, caught by the ballboy. Outside the boundary of course. team needed that. batsman backs away and picks the slower delivery, lofts well and off the middle of the bat. Just crossed the ropes at long-off and well taken low by the man who is the centre of attraction as the cameras pan to him"
2077,"SIX, second six of the over. Again it is batsman who is doing the damage. Rushed out and clouted the slower delivery high and long. Hardik at long-off tried his best, leaping with one hand to his right, but the ball was always winning that battle. Just over him and six"
2078,"SIX, third six for batsman. bowler went for the slower delivery after two yorkers. batsman was sitting in his crease and waiting for that. A mighty swing over long-on and that's the biggest of the lot for him. Chahal is seen clapping from the dressing room"
2079,"1 run, Rohit leaves it to Buttler coming in from sweeper when it was his catch. The ball lands bang in the middle of the two. bowler bowling it wide as he saw batsman advancing, in the end - it was a one-handed slice in the air and the batsman got lucky"
2080,"FOUR, can't miss your length with this field. Since both long-off and long-on are wide. Full and outside off, blasted over the umpire's head. batsman is playing a blinder here"
2081,"out Caught by Pollard!! End of batsman. The back of the hand slower delivery, rolling the fingers across the ball, sits up to be smashed, but batsman can only find long-on with a pull. batsman c Pollard b bowler 35(23) [4s-1 6s-3]"
2082,"out Caught by Pollard!! This man makes it look so easy. With the sunglasses and the floppy hat on he takes a high catch and makes it look ridiculously easy. Flat-batted high into the sky as bowler bowled it short, when the ball is anywhere near Pollard, he is expected to take it and he does so, running around to his left, keeping himself inside the playing area. bowler on a hat-trick now. batsman c Pollard b bowler 28(22) [4s-2]"
2083,"out Aravind Run Out!! No hat-trick for bowler. But a team hat-trick. Shortish outside off, batsman cuts and misses. They run for the bye and Aravind isn't even in the frame as Parthiv Patel runs forward to effect the run-out. Aravind run out (Parthiv Patel) 0(0)"
2084,"SIX, a step forward and then thump over long-on. All bottom hand in that. Trademark batsman. Saw the flight on that leggie and then thumped it with lots of wrist and the bottom hand took over. Long-on was just a spectator"
2085,"out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! batsman holes out. To deep mid-wicket. Went down on one knee and tried to slog-sweep that but no connection whatsoever on that hit, easy catch for the fielder. He was going hard on everything and his misery ends. batsman c Hardik Pandya b bowler 17(13) [4s-3]"
2086,"SIX, what wrists he has. Played a similar kind of shot against Basil Thampi a couple of games ago. That one flew over deep square leg, this over long-on. A little shimmy and picks the slower delivery, then the wrists take over. Like a flick of a switch, he uncorks those wrists and the ball sails a long way over long-on. No-one else in world cricket can play that pickup shot from the pads as well as batsman does"
2087,"out Caught by Rohit!! And just like that he is gone. Look at batsman's expression. One of disbelief. Which we have seen quite often this season. That feeling of how have I done this. A harmless cutter down leg, batsman has just chipped it head-high to mid-wicket to his opposite number. A dolly and Rohit can't hide his smile. bowler is busy fist pumping his way to glory. That's as soft as it gets. And it has happened repetitively for batsman's liking this season. When it is not going for you, these things can happen. batsman c Rohit b bowler 20(14) [6s-2]"
2088,"FOUR, that's classy from batsman. This bouncing ball was cramping him for room, but he arched back and then created his own momentum to cut it over backward point. Wide of sweeper as well. That's a top top shot"
2089,"SIX, is sweeper in business? No. It has gone all the way. Down the wicket and then cuts it hard and flat over the deep man's head. For a moment Buttler reckoned he was in with a chance, but it flew over his head"
2090,"FOUR, low full toss outside off, belted past short extra cover. He needed to hit that gap and did so easily"
2091,"FOUR, lovely shot. Waited for the ball to turn away and then delayed the shot to send it wide of point, sweeper had too much distance to cover and the ball beat him"
2092,"SIX, makes room and goes outside leg, sits down and then unleashes the slog-sweep. A flat hit over mid-wicket and all the way"
2093,"FOUR, gee, this man. It's not short, it's just wide. And seams in a touch to cut the room, but the hands that McCullum has. Cuts it up and over covers. No feet, all hands"
2094,"FOUR, there wasn't any room there, not much pace either - some 124 odd kays - but the trick was in playing late. McCullum does that. Plays close to his body, opens the bat face and steers a boundary behind the dive of short third"
2095,"out Bowled!! ""I have missed my morning jog today"" kinda sprint from Imran bowler. Now this is a wicket handed to him, and he's on a hat-trick here. Smith is making a comeback into the side, but decides to slog across a wrong 'un which he hadn't picked by a mile. Biding time is so old-fashioned.. The ball sneaks through the bat-pad gap and bowls him. Shambolic shot, to say the least. batsman b bowler 0(1)"
2096,"FOUR, edged and four! Pacy length ball wide of off, McCullum looks to drive with hard hands and gets a fat outside edge. Runs well past the keeper's reach and races away into the third man fence. Tahir puts a desperate dive, but can't stop it"
2097,"FOUR, shot! Right off the middle of the bat. Thakur offers with outside off and batsman smacks the drive through extra cover. Reached the fence like a bullet"
2098,out Caught by Rahane!! Big wicket for team. Baz was looking dangerous. He tried to go over covers by backing away. It was on the stumps and all McCullum could do was slice it to Rahane at deep backward point. batsman c Rahane b bowler 45(27) [4s-5 6s-2]
2099,"FOUR, wow! A brave shot from Jaddu. Waltzes down the track, gets to the pitch of the delivery and thumps it down the ground. With mid-on inside the circle, that's a safe shot. Gets it well wide of him and the ball has enough legs to go past the boundary rope"
2100,"FOUR, boundary to end the over. It didn't come off the middle of the bat, but batsman won't mind. It was a short ball from bowler. batsman is slightly late on his pull and gets it off the top part of the bat. Finds the gap in the deep mid-wicket area"
2101,"FOUR, that's a gift and batsman won't miss out. Short of a good length delivery drifting down leg, batsman tickles it fine. Runs away into the fine leg fence"
2102,"out Caught by Unadkat!! The short ball does the trick. bowler, at 131kph, darts a bumper on leg. The ball gets big on batsman, who is late on his pull. The ball balloons off bat and glove to settles into the hands of Unadkat at short fine leg. batsman c Unadkat b bowler 19(12) [4s-3]"
2103,"out Caught by Manoj Tiwary!! He dropped twice in the previous game, did Manoj Tiwary, but not today. batsman couldn't have hit it straighter to the fielder. He went deep in his crease and backed away to manufacture room. Slaps (middles) this short of length delivery straight to Tiwary at short cover. batsman c Manoj Tiwary b bowler 6(7)"
2104,out Caught by Tripathi!! Another one bites the dust. batsman was completely undone by the lack of pace. bowler bowled it around 117kph on a short of a good length. batsman is early into his stroke - to drive down the ground - and ends up chipping it high in the air off the outside part of the bat. Tripathi at mid-wicket settles under it and takes it with ease. batsman c Tripathi b bowler 1(2)
2105,"FOUR, much needed boundary. Another slower delivery, batsman dances down and heaves it away into the deep square leg fence"
2106,"FOUR, improvisation at its best. Reverses his stance even before the ball is delivered and brooms it away between short third man and backward point"
2107,"out Karthik Run Out!! This time MS doesn't miss and his opposite number is well short. Thampi looks to heave this length ball through mid-wicket and misses. MS, who had his right glove taken off, collects it and finds the target direct. OUT by a long way. Karthik run out (Dhoni) 29(26) [4s-3]"
2108,out Bowled!! team are bowled out with a ball to spare. The slower ball is too good for Soni. He gives a mighty swing and connects thin air. The ball cannons onto the stumps and the Lions finish on 161. batsman b bowler 0(1)
2109,"SIX, now he's cleared long leg here. Never looked like clearing it, trust me, but this guy packs a punch. Nicely inclined himself outside the line, with no feet, opening the area on the leg-side. Hoicked it up and over, and cleared the man in the deep, who was right at the boundary"
2110,"FOUR, completely duped. Totally. Kishan was looking to shimmy out but slipped, and to make things worse, Sundar drops it slightly wider. Kishan has to reach out and trims an inside edge past the leg-stump. Four. All that and four"
2111,"SIX, that's a tripe length. Short and Kishan has pulled him over deep mid-wicket. No fuss. Looked a six the moment he hit it, unlike that hoick over long leg last over"
2112,"FOUR, that's a shot that will shove you into a crisis. An outside edge or a glide? Yes, McCullum made room there but to drive, through covers. May have opened the bat face but that was an edge that beat short third, and raced away"
2113,"SIX, now smacks the bejeezus out of this. Gets his front leg out and hacks this ball over mid-wicket. All the way. Need drones to catch it"
2114,"FOUR, the partnership between batsman and Brendon McCullum is now 50+. A low, flat dipping full toss on middle and leg, and Ishan has hurried himself into a sweep round the corner"
2115,"FOUR, smacks a wide full ball, flat-batted, wide of Smith's one-handed leap at mid-off. Good aggressive shot that"
2116,"out Caught by Washington Sundar!! Bowls a googly last ball, messes up a young head and gets him with a wide one. Age matters. Kishan sees the width and throws his hands at it, only to slash it straight to Washington Sundar at short third man. Straight to him. He was looking good but had to reach out here, meaning he failed to keep the ball down. He's out but manages to impress in his little stint again, doesn't he? batsman c Washington Sundar b bowler 31(24) [4s-3 6s-2]"
2117,"FOUR, that has McCullum's swagger stamped all over it. Look at him making room, whilst stepping down the track, and smaking it flat-batted wide of Steven Smith at mid-off. Does put in a dive but that was motoring away. Not a chance, even with a dive"
2118,"out batsman Run Out!! 1 run completed. Oh Dhoni, thou friggin' beauty. That was at best a mortal throw from the deep mid-wicket fielder and Dhoni has transfigured it into a wicket-taking one. You have to see it to believe it. Turned towards deep square leg by batsman, Rahane sprinted across and let out a flat throw to his credit, severely threatening the second run there. And then Dhoni takes over. Waited behind the stumps, keeping his hands near the bails and just dislodges them off, like he hates them. Like he loves the red light. batsman is gone. Never take a second with Dhoni behind the wicket. Never. ""Dhoni, Dhoni""chants at the stadium. batsman run out (Rahane/Dhoni) 8(8)"
2119,"FOUR, now he's managed to get under a very full ball. The trick was in not reaching out for the ball. Stayed put, lifted the ball and got it over wide mid-on. Good shot"
2120,"1 run, Stokes misses a direct hit here. Certain run out opportunity. Firstly, batsman is duped by a slower ball. Pops it up towards short point, where Stokes comes sprinting in and attacks the ball. Picks the right end too, with batsman having given up, but misses"
2121,"SIX, and look at how McCullum celebrates Stokes no-bullseye last ball. Gets the right length to smack his bat right across to, and does so effectively. Hedgehopped over deep mid-wicket"
2122,"SIX, what can a bowler do. Bowl, they say. Perfectly good ball from bowler here. Wrong 'un on off stump but batsman has his front leg out, smacking it over deep mid-wicket with the turn. What have you got, bowler?"
2123,"out Caught&Bowled!! Two overs, two wickets. bowler is the late-bloomer we all want to be. He was driven on the up last ball, so drags the length back this time. Just a bit. batsman was looking to nudge a single to mid-wicket at best, but is early into the shot. Perhaps the ball held up and the leading edge was devoured by bowler. And the celebrations followed. batsman c and b bowler 13(6) [4s-1 6s-1]"
2124,"FOUR, drifts on the pads of batsman, who does not have to do much. Gets on his toes and tickles it into the fine leg fence to get things going"
2125,"out Lbw!! Appeal and umpire Marais Erasmus raises his finger. Oh, the replays suggest it pitched marginally outside leg. But too tough to spot that in real time. batsman was on the back foot to keep that out. The ball came in off the deck. bowler has that extra pace and which is why he was able to evade the bat of batsman. Was hit around the knee-roll and Gujarat have got the start they wanted. batsman lbw b bowler 4(4) [4s-1]"
2126,"FOUR, the bait that batsman throws to the bowler - shuffles across to this inswinging ball and flicks through mid-wicket to get off the mark with a boundary"
2127,"out Caught by Ankit Soni!! bowler's pace has devoured another one. Good pacy bumper that kept climbing on to batsman, who wanted to hook this one. Was hit on the splice and hence no power behind the shot. The man at short fine leg has to move a few yards to his right to make things a little tricky for Pune. batsman c Ankit Soni b bowler 4(2) [4s-1]"
2128,out Lbw!! What is happening there. batsman is gone. Stephen Fleming in the dug-out has a sorry look on his face. batsman goes on the back foot to play a full ball. It is a reminiscence of what happened in Australia close to a decade ago. Thampi is not as quick as Brett Lee but has enough venom to catch him in front. The ball would have crashed on to the leg-stump. batsman lbw b bowler 0(2)
2129,"1 run, 50 for batsman. Second one in the IPL. Pune need him tonight. Pulls a short ball to deep mid-wicket to get to the milestone"
2130,"FOUR, batsman leaves his crease too early. bowler sees that and throws it pretty wide but that does not help him get away. batsman manages to put some bat and squeezes it to the deep backward point fence"
2131,"SIX, this shot is all about the sound it made. Goes back and across to this short ball and hammers the pull over the deep mid-wicket fence"
2132,"SIX, that could have taken a couple of them down in the crowd. batsman swings. Why not. Length ball, sits up there and batsman just swings across. ""The big Ben,"" the screen displays"
2133,"FOUR, now makes room to a ball that was always going to be fuller, and slaps it through covers. Top shot as a follow up to that brute of a ball"
2134,"out Caught by Brendon McCullum!! From the lanes of Kerala to outwitting batsman on the grandest of stages. A slower ball, and the funny bit is that batsman did read it. Was wide outside off, so waited before letting out a forehanded slap. batsman waits, and then some, and hits but couldn't impart the power that he should have. Straight to McCullum at long-off. Pune might be done here.. but hey, Stokes here. batsman c Brendon McCullum b bowler 26(33) [4s-1 6s-1]"
2135,"FOUR, that's a I-don't-want-you-to-be-a-bowler hit. Takes his front leg out of the way and flat-bats Thampi over his head. Disparaging hit. Utterly disdainful"
2136,"FOUR, past Faulkner at backward point. Dives sideways with outstretched right hand but can't stop this brutal cut from batsman. Saw the width and just laid into it"
2137,"SIX, oh dear, that simplifies things. A 79-meter six. 19 needed off 11 now. A full toss and that has been bruted over long-on. A full-blooded bat swat and boom, it's outta here"
2138,"SIX, for a moment, I thought it's headed to long-off. But Finch was there, and the ball would have cleared Finch on Finch's shoulders there. Long, big hit. Made room, as he's been doing, and clouts it over the fielder. Way over him, as I have made amply clear"
2139,"FOUR, no more an IPL virgin. Pune goes loud and berserk as batsman hits a century here. His first in the Indian Premier League. His first ever in Twenty20s. Backs away and slaps a drive through extra cover. What a gorgeous shot. Raises his bat after a fist-pump and screeches, in cramps and joy, err.. He's almost taken Pune home here"
2140,"SIX, Dhoni and Smith half-hug in the dug out, Pune's crowd cheers its lungs out. Supergiant beat Gujarat for the first time ever in IPL. batsman gets a ball sitting up and scythes the ball over square leg. Way over it. With that, it's goodbye team from IPL 2017"
2141,"FOUR, keeping things simple and straight is batsman there. There was a hint of movement on this full ball. batsman did well to not try something fancy, presented the full blade and bisected the gap between the bowler and mid-on"
2142,"FOUR, batsman was on the charge for a moment but saw the length early. It was a bit shortish outside off and batsman fetched the pull from there, hit it all along the ground to the deep mid-wicket fence"
2143,"SIX, short ball and batsman seems to have got his eye in. Goes back in no time and times the pull well over the deep backward square leg fence. Goes deep into the stands"
2144,"FOUR, wow shot from batsman. Pure timing from batsman. Stands tall to this short ball and cuts past the man at backward point"
2145,"FOUR, slower ball that is too wide, makes things easy for batsman. He stays back in the crease and thumps past the man at cover. Once he has got that out of the ring, it is always racing away"
2146,out Tripathi Run Out!! 1 run completed. That is farcical from Tripathi. What was he thinking? Called for the second run and then stops mid-way to spoil things for himself because batsman had committed for the run. batsman thuds this on-drive down the ground towards long-on. Finch has some distance to cover and Tripathi senses the second run. Withdraws late and digs his grave as Finch hits the target at the bowler's end. batsman looked angry there. No fault of his though. Tripathi run out (Finch) 6(7) [4s-1]
2147,"FOUR, those trunk-like forearms take over. bowler tosses outside off and batsman drives with the turn. Places it wide of sweeper whose dive makes contact with the ball but fails to keep that in. First boundary for batsman"
2148,"SIX, when 11 deliveries have been dot out of 12, you do such things. Like going across the line and sending it well over cow corner for a maxium"
2149,"SIX, and when the bowler dares to flight, you - on the back of confidence - try it again. This time, batsman clubs it well over the long-on fence. Too big a hit"
2150,"SIX, that's a glorious shot! bowler bangs it short without any venom behind it. batsman stands tall and launches it over long-off. See the ball and hit the ball. He hit that and stood for the photographs"
2151,"FOUR, that's a cracking shot to get off the mark! That was a gift from bowler. Short and wide outside off, batsman backs away, clears the front leg and slaps it hard over covers. One bounce and over the fence"
2152,"FOUR, that's one of the best shots of the game. A slight move across and offers a straight bat to send it between long-on and deep mid-wicket"
2153,"SIX, this guy and his timing. Reads this short ball early and waits on the back foot. Pulls from there into the deep square leg fence"
2154,"out Bowled!! Wow! What a reply from bowler. He did not like the six for sure. Comes back with a peach of a yorker and as Mr Gavaskar informs us this was around 27.4kph quicker than the previous ball - 115kph. A yorker on the legs, too tough to negotiate. batsman's bat comes down late and he deflects it off his leg to the off-pole. bowler is delighted. batsman b bowler 34(20) [4s-4 6s-1]"
2155,"SIX, another loose ball around off. batsman swings across the line and for a moment it seems he is in danger of skying this one. But he is not, sends over the long-on fence. Mighty hit"
2156,"SIX, and again! Unlike Corey Anderson, batsman does not miss out on this short ball. Camps back in time and thunders the pull deep into the stands over deep mid-wicket"
2157,"SIX, after a barrage of mistimed swipes and pulls finally batsman gets one off the middle of the willow. And when he gets those off the meat, no ground is big enough. A length ball served with gentle pace. What else does he need? Swings and swings well to clear the man at long-on"
2158,"1 run, Henriques over-trusts his legs and spoils a catch that could have been 'the one' for Dhawan who ran from sweeper towards this skier. batsman had thrown his bat at a wide ball and sliced off the outer half. If not for his luck and Henriques ambitions, batsman would have been walking back"
2159,"out Caught by Siraj!! Slower ball on off, on the shorter side as well. batsman has already given himself some room. That's like committing without knowing what is in store. Cannot retreat, it is late for him. Tries to ramp but there is no pace or the bounce to ease things for him. Ends up guiding it into the hands of Siraj at short third man. This is far from over. Delhi have not chased well and because they have not, they will need some extra effort to go past the line here. Time-out in the meantime. batsman c Siraj b bowler 33(25) [4s-1 6s-2]"
2160,"SIX, bye bye ball. Slips on the legs of batsman. Was a slower ball and batsman whipped it from there, skies it high but gets the distance as well. Manages to clear Dhawan at deep square leg"
2161,"FOUR, placed! Well placed! This is what Delhi were lacking. It is a short ball and batsman rolls his wrists on the pull to bisect the fielders converging from deep backward square leg and deep mid-wicket"
2162,"FOUR, there is a thing called luck. But there is nothing called like a bowler's luck. He is always at the receiving end of things. It is a yorker, almost fells batsman down. Cannot get his bat down in time but manages to put some willow on it. That is enough to deflect this to the fine leg fence"
2163,"SIX, if not for the stands this would have travelled more. Might have got the metro from Pragati Maidan. Fuller length and batsman cleared his front leg, cracked it hard and hit flat over the long-on fence"
2164,"SIX, at the outset this one did not seem to have come off the middle. But he had timed it well. Has that power to clear the fence. A short ball and batsman pulls well over the deep mid-wicket fielder"
2165,"FOUR, Short ball. batsman pulls and mid-off is in the ring, this will be a four, giving Delhi a much-needed win. Has this been given as four or is it only a single? Yes it is a four. Delhi win by 6-wickets"
2166,"FOUR, nothing wrong this time. Right off the middle. Kumar offers width wide of off on this short of length delivery and batsman takes advantage of it. He punches it and bisects cover and cover-point. Races away"
2167,"FOUR, a very unlike Bhuvi over. He was all over the place this over. Shortish delivery outside off, you don't offer width to this guy. Flays the bat hard at it and lifts it over the infield on the off-side. Bullets into the cover fence"
2168,"SIX, third man in business? Nope, over him. Cheeky shot from the Karnataka batsman. It was banged in short outside off, batsman waits for it and periscopes it over the non-existent slip. Has enough power to go over third man, who thought he might have a chance there"
2169,"FOUR, 2 runs off the first four balls, and then leaks 10 runs off the next two. DD are off to a flier. Kaul pitches it up and batsman drills it down the ground with a shimmy down. All along the carpet, into the fence"
2170,"out Caught by Dhawan!! First breakthrough for team totally against the run of play. Once again the familiar culprit doing the trick - the slower ball. It was on a good length and wide of off. batsman is early into his stroke - the slash. In the end, slices it straight into the bucket hands of Dhawan at cover-point. batsman c Dhawan b bowler 24(19) [4s-2 6s-1]"
2171,"FOUR, nowhere near the middle of the bat, but batsman won't mind a bit. batsman backs away and wanted to loft it inside-out over covers. Since the ball was a slower one, he ends up slicing it over covers. The quick outfield does the rest"
2172,"1 run, dropped! Bhuvi, the culprit. batsman, trying to be too cheeky, almost gifted his wicket. Moves across a long way and attempted the scoop shot. Got decent amount of wood, but there wasn't enough elevation there. It went at catchable height to Bhuvi at short fine. He makes a mess of it"
2173,"FOUR, this time well over short fine. The keeper is up and bowler bowls a full length delivery just outside off, batsman shuffles across and nicely scoops it away over Bhuvi and the ball races away"
2174,"SIX, batsman is on a roll here! Straight, length ball, batsman moves leg-side and launches it straight over the bowler's head. The ball sails over the sightscreen for a maximum"
2175,"FOUR, four more! The runs are coming thick and fast for DD. Not the greatest of deliveries from bowler. Short and drifting down leg, batsman gets inside the line and pulls it fine, beating the diving fine leg fielder"
2176,"FOUR, welcome to Delhi says Rishabh batsman. A loosener from bowler. Quick delivery well down leg, batsman is quick to get low and smack the sweep well wide of short fine"
2177,"out Caught by Bhuvneshwar!! In the air and taken! The knuckle ball from Kaul does the trick. batsman waltzes down by backing away. Goes through with his crouched slap. Gets reasonable amount of timber on that. He hit it flat and that led to his downfall. Bhuvi at long-off, moves to his left and times his mini-jump to perfection and gobbles it up. A big wicket! batsman c Bhuvneshwar b bowler 39(20) [4s-5 6s-2]"
2178,"FOUR, poor ball and batsman takes full toll of it. Low full toss, batsman sinks low and smacks the sweep through square leg. Off the sweet spot of the bat"
2179,"FOUR, that's a gross delivery. Short and wide outside off, batsman waits for it and lifts it over extra cover for four runs"
2180,"FOUR, four more! bowler isn't learning here. He is continuously offfering width outside off. batsman spots it and pummels it in front of square on the off-side. No chance for Dhawan in the deep"
2181,"FOUR, and he's away in a flash. Shortish and just outside off stump, batsman rocks back and cuts fiercely through cover-point"
2182,"FOUR, not the ideal start for bowler. Fullish and swinging into the left-hander, batsman flicks, fine leg is inside the ring and he had no chance. Off the mark in a flash"
2183,"FOUR, oh this goes at a catchable height but there is no one at extra-cover. Would have been a straightforward chance. batsman is certainly having trouble facing bowler's angle, chips gently, was a poor shot and he'd say that he deliberately played that with that gap on the off-side. Didn't look convincing though"
2184,"FOUR, delicate. The googly just outside off, batsman waited for it to arrive, opened the bat face and steers it past the diving short third man"
2185,"out Caught by Chris Morris!! Second wicket for bowler. He's got two big ones - Warner and now batsman. Slower short delivery, kept climbing on the Kiwi, who went for the pull and only managed a fat top edge towards deep square leg. He was never going to in control of the shot as the ball got big on him. Smart bowling from bowler as well, rolled his fingers across at the last moment. DD have pulled things back nicely after the powerplay. Just 26 runs scored and two wickets taken. batsman c Chris Morris b bowler 24(24) [4s-1 6s-1]"
2186,"FOUR, oh gosh! That was vintage batsman. Full delivery on the stumps, batsman does not bother to get his front leg behind the line, short-arm jabs the loft over the bowler's head, one bounce and over the ad hoardings"
2187,"FOUR, anything in his zone and batsman is willing to take it on. The googly which is a bit full in length, batsman's back leg is in the air as he lofts it over bowler. Almost similar to the one he played in the last over"
2188,"FOUR, he's not gonna miss out twice in two balls. bowler drifts another one on the pads, batsman gets the faintest of touches on the ball and it races away to the fine leg fence"
2189,"FOUR, brilliant stop from Mathews. But did he touch the cushions? The third umpire has a look and spots something in contact with the triangles. Short delivery and batsman pulls in front of square, Mathews ran in from deep square, dived and stopped the ball, but it was spinning back towards the rope and he flicked it in and that's when he was in touch"
2190,"FOUR, boundary to start the 18th. The slower delivery that drifts onto the batsman's hips, batsman does not do anything fancy, tickles it round the corner and allows the outfield to do the rest"
2191,"FOUR, unlucky! batsman is hurried by the short delivery, but at this stage of the innings the batsmen tend to throw their bat at everything, the top edge flies over short fine and lands just in front of the rope"
2192,"SIX, not off the middle, but it doesn't have to be when it is batsman Singh. The cross-seamer on off, batsman clears his front leg to heave it into the on-side, off the base of the bat and over the man patrolling the deep mid-wicket fence"
2193,"FOUR, big over for team. 20 off it and bowler has been put under pressure. Fuller and width on offer, batsman square drives and the placement is superb, well wide of the man sweeping on the off-side"
2194,"FOUR, Morris is shaking his head, but there is very little he can do about that. The yorker just outside off, batsman waited and went low, opened the bat face and dug it to the right of short third man, who dived just as an afterthought"
2195,"FOUR, fifty for batsman. Even though it is Delhi, the crowd are up on their feet to applaud the knock. batsman acknowledges it with a wave of the bat. The slower length delivery, heaved in front of square, bisecting the two men in the deep"
2196,"no ball, FOUR, horrendous start. He oversteps and dishes out a full delivery, batsman's hands take over, he drives it past extra cover and the ball raced away to the fence. No chance for the sweeper"
2197,"FOUR, too full and missed the yorker by a couple of inches, batsman doesn't miss though, whipped it square and past the man at square leg. Boundaries flowing in the final part of the innings"
2198,"FOUR, sloppy! The low full toss outside off, batsman was trying to slice it behind point, got it finer than he would have liked. Jayant at third man makes a meal of that. Allows it to escape past him"
2199,"SIX, this is the advantage of having the ability to play the switch-hit. You can't set fields for such shots. A good flighted delivery on the stumps, nothing wrong with the delivery, batsman makes decent connection, although it was a top edge and it cleared the rope over backward point"
2200,"FOUR, finishes the innings on a positive note. 19 runs off the over. bowler went for 39 in his final two overs. You have to get the yorker spot on against batsman. Slightly off and he puts it away, the bat comes down like an axe and he lofts it over bowler, one bounce and into the fence"
2201,"FOUR, similar delivery to the previous one and this time Morris pays the price, batsman is looking good today. The shots have been timed well. This time he's executed the cover-drive to perfection"
2202,"SIX, he's so good with that pick up shot. Plays it in his own way. Stylish! Morris once again bowls the perfect length to lift over the top, the full ball was on the leg as well and batsman used his lovely wrists to whip it away over the mid-wicket boundary"
2203,"FOUR, now the bowler overcompensates by bowling short. There wasn't much of width on this one, but hopped and backed away slightly to create a bit of room and cut it away to the right of backward point"
2204,"FOUR, batsman knew that a slower ball was coming, backed away nicely to free the arms and slapped it hard over extra-cover for four. Easy pickings those"
2205,"FOUR, slower ball, heaved away, no timing but it escapes for four. Another great start from this lovely team opening pair. Fifty comes up in 5.1 overs. This one was in the air, but wide of the man at mid-wicket"
2206,"out Bowled!! Missed a few games? No problem. I know how to nail the yorkers. This is such a difficult art for bowlers, but look at bowler, this is just the second ball of his spell and he's bowled one at 141kph to knock batsman's off pole out. The team captain didn't look comfortable at all and DD will be delighted with that wicket. batsman was never willing to cover the line against the right-handed pacers, was always looking to back away and open up the off-side. bowler spotted that and outfoxed the batsman with a brilliant yorker. batsman b bowler 30(21) [4s-4 6s-1]"
2207,"leg byes, FOUR, that's down the leg-side, batsman misses the flick, the ball beats the keeper off the thigh pad and goes for four"
2208,"FOUR, bowler tries the slower ball bouncer, batsman does well to roll his wrists and control the hook shot, sends it past short fine leg"
2209,"SIX, oh dear! That's released all the pressure. He'd beaten batsman twice and then follows it up with a filthy delivery in the form of trying a variation. He suggests that he wanted to bowl the carrom ball, but it slipped down the leg-side and batsman helped himself to a six with a pull over backward square leg"
2210,"out Caught by Shreyas Iyer!! The moment he tosses one up, he gets a wicket. I was surprised by that first delivery when he chose to bowl flat. Enough in the pitch for a spinner to enjoy his outing. A gentle fist pump from the local lad. This was the googly, batsman went for the sweep, went with hard hands, got a top edge and Iyer came forward from deep backward square leg and took a good catch. Big wicket for DD. batsman was well set and he needed to carry on. batsman c Shreyas Iyer b bowler 28(17) [4s-4 6s-1]"
2211,"out Caught&Bowled!! Wicket-maiden! This over exemplies how a bowler sets up a batsman. After varying stuffs for 5 deliveries, he keeps this one short around off. There is almost no pace off the track and batsman, who is waiting to slap off the back foot, makes a mess of the timing. Chipping it back off the lower half of the bat to the bowler. bowler almost grabs it in a hurry. What a start for Pune. batsman c and b bowler 0(6)"
2212,"FOUR, whip of the wrists and off she went, one bounce four. Thakur is into his third over on the trot, full and angled into the pads, Pandey picks it over the mid-wicket fielder"
2213,"FOUR, third boundary of the over. Might be one over too many for Thakur. Short slower delivery and it sat up nicely for the swat from Pandey, he tonks it over mid-wicket and no one in the deep to stop that"
2214,"SIX, ""that's Colin batsman,"" goes Doully on air. He spots the googly, kneels down and slog sweeps it with the spin over cow corner. He's a big man and that ball sailed a long way into the crowd"
2215,"SIX, consecutive sixes for batsman. Should have been caught. Once more goes with the turn, lofts the leggie towards long-off. Got height more than the distance, Christian moves across to his left and parries it over the fence. He misjudged the rope behind him. There was enough space to go a foot back"
2216,"FOUR, this time manages to elude the short third man fielder. Waits for the back of a length delivery to arrive, opens the bat face and delicately places it wide of Sundar"
2217,"FOUR, the initial call from batsman was ""two"". Even he didn't know how well he had timed it. Full toss just outside off, which is caressed through extra cover. Rahane at sweeper had given up the chase quite early"
2218,"out Caught by Rahane!! Rahane has the safest pair of hands in India. He ain't dropping these skiers. An important breakthrough for team as the partnership was slowly taking the game away from them. Pandey backed away and bowler followed him with a slower delivery, the batsman still goes through with the pick up shot, no pace on the ball meant he picked out deep mid-wicket. batsman c Rahane b bowler 37(32) [4s-3 6s-1]"
2219,"FOUR, bowler has his hands on his head. He shouted ""catch it,"" but it was nowhere close to the fielder. Slower back of a length delivery, batsman punched it on the up and in the air, wide of extra cover and sweeper though"
2220,"FOUR, not where he intended, but the final result is what he was looking for. Floated up outside off, batsman wanted to go over long-off, sliced over backward point and Sundar saw the ball balloon over him"
2221,"out Caught by Washington Sundar!! Break and a wicket. How many times have we heard that? Even Pathan perished first ball after the first time-out and now it is batsman. Once more bowler resorts to the slower delivery, the Kiwi is completely deceived as he closes the bat face and the leading edge pops up to backward point. batsman c Washington Sundar b bowler 36(19) [4s-3 6s-2]"
2222,"SIX, is it Suryakumar's night? Has been quiet in the tournament and has been in-and-out of the side as well. Picked the back of a length slower delivery, pivoted on his front leg and pulled it over deep square leg"
2223,"out Woakes Run Out!! 1 run completed. Dangerous thing to take on Smith and Woakes pays the price. Suryakumar bunts the length delivery to long-on, Smith was quick to swoop down on the ball and released it even quicker. The throw was right on top of the stumps, bowler had got back, collected the throw and light up the stumps. Even a full stretch from Woakes was not enough. Woakes run out (Smith/bowler) 1(3)"
2224,"FOUR, sweep shot off a pacer. You don't see that often. The slower delivery and Suryakumar spotted it very early, went across his stumps and broomed it over short fine"
2225,"FOUR, lovely shot! The off-pace delivery and Suryakumar is playing with bowler, makes room and lofts it inside out over extra cover, no chance for the long-off fielder to cut that"
2226,"SIX, 14 off the first three balls. bowler is predictable and Suryakumar is toying with him, plants his front foot across the stumps, laps it over backward square, a better connection meant maximum result"
2227,"SIX, Collision between Smith and Stokes. The latter straightaway calls for the physio. After crashing into Stokes, Smith goes bang into the ad boardings. Head first and it bounced off. Smith gets up and has a word with the physio. Seems to be fine. That looked brutal. Slower delivery from bowler and batsman swung across the line towards deep mid-wicket. Stokes ran to his left and Smith ran to his right from long-on. Both were watching the ball and not each other. It was the Englishman who caught the ball, but once he dashed into Smith the flick back didn't go where he intended"
2228,"out Caught by Washington Sundar!! bowler has his name in the wicket column. Short of length delivery following batsman, who had made room to smash one into the on-side, the ball kept cramping him for room and once the bat face was closed, the leading edge lobbed to backward point. Sundar accepts the dolly there. batsman c Washington Sundar b bowler 6(5) [6s-1]"
2229,"FOUR, makes room and does well by not going completely berserk with the shot. Had his eyes on the ball and slapped it past the man at backward point"
2230,"FOUR, batsman skips down and does well with the loft. Did not appear to have given it everything. The focus was on the timing after he met the pitch of the ball. Lifted it pretty straight and fetched a four to the long-on fence"
2231,out Hit Wkt!! That is why you should not use the depth this much. Goes back to tuck and after making the connection steps on the stumps. Dhoni realizes and appeals but batsman is already walking before the customary check sent upstairs confirms the wicket. What a soft dismissal indeed. batsman hit wkt b bowler 10(9) [4s-2]
2232,"FOUR, the way he had been caged, this was coming! Clears the front leg and swipes across the line, finding the gap through mid-wicket"
2233,"FOUR, consecutive fours for the skipper and this one is more classic. Goes back to this ball and tucks it fine after a hop in the crease. The ball races to the fine leg fence"
2234,"FOUR, that's so pleasing to watch. Moves aside to open up a bit and then goes inside out over cover. Races away"
2235,"SIX, wow! This is brutal! Dances down the track and goes big with the swing. Sends well over the long-on fence"
2236,"out Caught by Rahane!! And again! Hold on, he is caught in the deep. Sundar tossed up again, as if challenging batsman to go after it again. The latter took the offer and slogged across the line. It seemed he had made a good connection but there was a speed-breaker at the deep mid-wicket fence. Rahane timed his jump to perfection and plucked it from above his head. The captain goes and team are now in a spot of bother. batsman c Rahane b bowler 24(19) [4s-3 6s-1]"
2237,"1 run, guides with the turn to short third man and calls for the run. Pathan has to hurry as Dhoni does that blind trick to hit the stumps at the striker's end. Yeah, that thing where he flicks the ball back on to the stumps even as he keeps his eyes on the thrower"
2238,"SIX, he goes against the turn, I assume! And then takes the biggest part of the ground to hit this one. But Pandey has got this one right off the middle of the bat to leave the fielder at the fence as a mere spectator"
2239,"out Lbw!! And he has done it. Pune wanted one of these. They had bowler and he has managed to get rid of Pathan. Skids this straighter ball. Quicker than what Pathan expected it to be. Though, cannot be justified for playing this one off the back foot. Once he misses, the ball catches his leg right in front. The big appeal, followed by the raise of finger from the umpire and then that famous sprint from the bowler. batsman lbw b bowler 4(9)"
2240,"FOUR, batsman is away. Sees the width and throws his bat, gets an outside edge that flies past first slip. Would've been gobbled up by second slip, if there was ever one"
2241,"FOUR, that's a quality shot from batsman. A short of length delivery outside off, batsman gets on top of it and thumps it over the infield on the off-side"
2242,"out Caught by Jackson!! Eden roars. batsman has been given the pink slip. What a ball from Umesh, strikes gold in his first over. Cramps him with this short of length delivery that nipped back in a fraction, batsman was caught in a state of dilemma. Tried to ride the bounce, was too late and ends up feathering it to the keeper. Early strike for team. batsman c Jackson b bowler 11(9) [4s-2]"
2243,"FOUR, slog-swept! Shabby fielding effort from Woakes at deep mid-wicket. Dives to his left, but doesn't stretch enough to flick the ball back"
2244,"SIX, how well has he hit that? Boy! He is having some fun out there. Skates out of his crease, wasn't quite to the pitch, but why bother? He swung it handsomely over mid-wicket"
2245,"SIX, another one! Bam bam! He reaches his highest T20 score and does it in some style. Greyhounds down the pitch and takes bowler for a journey over mid-wicket"
2246,"SIX, my word! Don't drop it there to this lad. On seeing the loop, he gets down on his knees and bludgeons it barrel straight over the bowler's head. Runs raining at team's E-DEN"
2247,"out Caught&Bowled!! Excellent catch by bowler, considering his fielding standards mind you! He is one of the slowest, languid among the team fielders, but not on this occasion. Gets the ball to grip as he cuts as much pace as possible, batsman went for the pull, but was way too early into the shot. A thick top-edge balloons around the mid-wicket area, bowler calls for it, runs around and grabs it. batsman c and b bowler 14(15) [4s-1]"
2248,"out Caught by Jackson!! TWO IN TWO. batsman walks. bowler has dismissed MS both times team played team this season. The googly, lands it fuller and draws batsman forward, he fiddles while striding forward a long way, thin edge through to the keeper. batsman c Jackson b bowler 5(9)"
2249,"SIX, on one knee and launched! batsman into the 90s. Wanted to have a piece of bowler once more, got down and thwacked him with a slog-sweep over mid-wicket"
2250,"out Caught by (sub)Rovman Powell!! Feel for this fella! He deserved a 100 or at least needed to be there till the end. Similar emotions from Smithy as he tweaks his hair in disappointment. Takes on the short ball this time and pulls to the right of short mid-wicket, there's Rovman Powell fielding there? He is from the Caribbean, won't drop catches. Dives full length and takes a blinder. batsman c (sub)Rovman Powell b bowler 93(52) [4s-9 6s-7]"
2251,"SIX. All over! Some glum faces among the crowd. Three back to back wins for team. A right-handed version of Ben Stokes, batsman waits for the short ball, once it arrives, he murders the pull flat over mid-wicket"
2252,"FOUR, fabulous shot from batsman. Rides the bounce and cracks a solid punch that breaches the crowded off-side field. Races away to the fence"
2253,"SIX, this must be demoralising for bowler. Telegrams his intentions and shimmies out to meet the pitch, converts it into a full ball and blasts it over extra cover. Enough to carry it all the way"
2254,"FOUR, NCN overcorrects and dishes out a full toss, batsman sets up a solid base and drills it past mid-on. Didn't get it off the middle but manages it thread it past the fielder"
2255,"FOUR, 19 runs off the over. An expensive one for team. A short ball that sits up nicely for batsman, he spindles across and pulls it behind square. Goes all the way for a maximum"
2256,"byes, FOUR, ooh, almost did him there. batsman gives the charge to this back of a length delivery that shaped back in, aiming to open the up the off-side field. In the process, gets an inside edge that eludes a diving Jackson. The umpire fails to spot it and gives it as byes"
2257,"SIX, imperious. What a strike from batsman. Isn't intimidated by this short ball, takes it from over his head and deposits it over the long-leg fence. He got into the position early and hooked it off the meat off the bat"
2258,"FOUR, batsman is cutting loose here. Reads this leg-cutter early, flashes it hard and gets it over backward-point."
2259,"SIX, wow. Gorgeuous from batsman. Brings up the fastest fifty for team in IPL. Stands motionless and lets his hands do the talking. Extends his arms and lifts it handsomely into the long-on stands"
2260,"FOUR, batsman takes a cue from his skipper and plays a fabulous shot. Gets under this full ball and almost checks his shot past mid-on"
2261,"out Bowled!! bowler has the final laugh. One shot too many for batsman. Just sticks to his basics and targets the stumps, batsman exposed his stumps aiming for a flashy punch through cover. The ball striaghtened a bit and the team skipper misses it completely. The ball kisses the top of off. Talk about basics, Laxman Sivaramakrishnan will be a proud man. batsman b bowler 9(9) [6s-1]"
2262,"SIX, terrific striking from batsman. Gets right back to this short ball and muscles it away over the cow corner fence for a maximum"
2263,"FOUR, magnificent. Shimmies out to meet the pitch and bullies it through extra cover"
2264,"FOUR, batsman is putting on a show here. He is 47 off just 18 balls. The short ball ain't working against him. bowler isn't learing, peppers it short without any purpose. batsman is committed onto the front foot and flat-bats it over mid-on"
2265,"FOUR, bowler is greeted to the crease with a boundary. Deft from Tiwary, waits to the last moment and late cuts it to the third man fence. Almost fetched it from the keeper's gloves"
2266,"FOUR, batsman reaches fifty in style. Fastest individual fifty for team. Walks across his sticks, goes low and scoops it to the fine leg fence. Raises his bat and Tiwary embraces him"
2267,"out Bowled!! Gone. bowler gets his second wicket. A nothing shot from Tiwary, a good length delivery that vaults back in a touch, Tiwary has a feel for it sans any feet. Gets an inside edge that crashes back onto the stumps. The off-stump goes for a cardio training. team lose their third. batsman b bowler 8(9) [4s-1]"
2268,"FOUR, audacious from batsman. Changes his stance and employs the reverse-hit. Directs it behind square on the off-side"
2269,"FOUR, batsman is off and running. Gets into business straightaway after having a sighter. Backs away to create some room, bowler kept it on middle and subsidized with width. batsman brings his bottom hand into play. Just extends his arms and steers it past the crowded off-side field"
2270,"FOUR, such minimal effort from batsman. Waits in his crease for this short of length delivery to arrive, uses his magical wrists and effortlessly pulls it over mid-wicket"
2271,"FOUR, oh dear. Ishan Kishan has defied the laws of living and walked through a ball at long leg. Or so it looked. Whipped off the pads, shipped away using the bottom hand and Kishan was charging in, and ran through"
2272,"SIX, he was undone by the lack of pace there. Early into the shot but made sure that he swung hard at this. Bruted it. And as much as it lacked the timing, it made up with its power, this shot. Clouted over deep mid-wicket, despite coming off the bottom half of the bat"
2273,"leg byes, 1 run, now he manages a leg bye this this. Early into his swat, batsman deflects it off his pads.. and runs"
2274,"SIX, what do you do to a slow bouncer? You bully it. Despite being in a tangle with your footwork. Had the weight back and could pull the bejeezus out of it. Brilliant shot"
2275,"SIX, *jumps into a well* This is turning out to be a ridiculously good innings. Unicorns are real, and so are DD chases. Gets a pitched up delivery and slogs it over long-on. No half measures. None at all. Pick the length and swing. Has been so successful so far"
2276,"SIX, umm. This looked effortless and it's gone into the crowd. Just a length ball, turning away and batsman has swatted it over long-on. Clocked 99 meters as if it's body temperature"
2277,"SIX, wide and slotted over covers. And it wasn't a bad ball from bowler, drifting it wide and making batsman reach out. But erred in the length and paid by six runs. That's it"
2278,"FOUR, as if the choice of bowling Smith wasn't enough, the bowlers chooses a full ball to bowl. Clattered over mid-wicket with a disparaging whip. Enough. No one in the deep"
2279,"FOUR, he's wound himself up brilliantly there. So brilliantly that he's taken a full ball on the stumps and whipped it over backward square leg, cleverly opening that side of the field by shuffling across early and getting into position. 44 off 42 and I see the unicorn already. Well, almost"
2280,"out Caught by Faulkner!! End of a good, good innings. They are checking for the no-ball but bowler ushers us to ""ooooohhh"" and then the back foot somehow manages to be halfway behind the line. Anyway, coming to the wicket, the ball sat up to be hit there. batsman just decided to go across the line, the ball may have spun, and the batsman ended up slicing the slog to towards wide long-off, where Faulkner's present. ""Oh he'll drop it"". ""Gujarat are having a bad day, so this should go down"". But it doesn't. Faulkner slides in front and takes a good catch. batsman c Faulkner b bowler 61(31) [6s-7]"
2281,"SIX, brilliant. A slog sweep that's been nailed into the stands, again. Nothing more I can add. He's just seeing the length so early tonight and readying himself for the hits"
2282,"FOUR, now this is a back foot punch over covers. You have to see it to believe it. bowler is from over the wicket to the left hander here. Just a touch short, batsman is so early there to get back and punch it up and over. Graceful, if it's ever been any more brutal"
2283,"out Caught by Karthik!! There's an appeal but the umpire has been stunned by this kid. Even the umpire. Thampi appeals, and after eliciting an obvious edge, and appeals again and then gets his man. Rishabh batsman doesn't fall short of a century here; he makes 97. Brutes them. Enthralling innings. Thampi angled this full and across, batsman drives and ekes out an outside edge, that's been nicely taken by Karthik behind. Erred in not using his feet there, and Thampi is quick. But he was in that sort of a mood. He was hitting everything outta here, so can't blame him. Not after 97 runs, can we? batsman c Karthik b bowler 97(43) [4s-6 6s-9]"
2284,"SIX, oh just a touch overpitched. And so overpitched that the change of pace doesn't matter much. And to make things worse, Iyer had read it. So waits a little longer and dumps the ball over long-off. More timing than anything else. Connected the ball at the right time and boom, you can hit it with a spoon too. Well, not really. 20 off 24 needed"
2285,"SIX, another six. Length ball, around off and Anderson has swung it over deep square leg. It's that sort of a day. 18 sixes already"
2286,"SIX, here's another. Shuffled across early, and was able to open up the long leg region. Picked the ball up and bottom-handed it over the ropes there. Just 4 needed"
2287,"SIX, Delhi have their highest ever run-chase. Anderson gets a full ball and pumps it over long-on to seal what was an easy win in the end"
2288,"SIX, wow. This is from batsman's refrigarator of awesomeness. Pure class. Drops it a tad short, does bowler. batsman is ready for it. Handsomely hacks it behind square, such is the power that it carries all the way for a maximum"
2289,"out Caught by Karthik!! Number one down. Kotla goes silent. batsman's failure continues. What was he trying to do there? Awful really. Redemption for bowler. Banged it short and it shooted up awkwardly at batsman. He was caught in two minds there. Initially, wanted to leave but then sees it as a scoring opportunity. Arches his back belatedly and tries it periscope it over the keeper. Too late. The ball catches a faint edge and carries to the keeper. batsman c Karthik b bowler 12(11) [4s-2]"
2290,"SIX, quality from batsman. Thampi bowls it short and compliments it with width, batsman reaches out and spanks it over cover"
2291,"SIX, you cannot afford to spray it on batsman's pads. Thampi just does that and gets punished. He gets inside the line and whips it nonchalantly behind square. Half a dozen!"
2292,"SIX, batsman joins into the act. High percentage shot this. Hauls his back leg in the air and elegantly swipes it into the deep square leg stands"
2293,"SIX, ""Three sixes in a row for Delhi"" screams Scott Styris on air. Finesse followed by violence. Loads up big time, gets under this full ball and smashes it over long-on. Soars a long way into the stands"
2294,"FOUR, 16 off first 3 balls. batsman is on fire. Protracts his hands to this widish ball and cleverly guides it past short third man. Kotla breaks the sound barrier"
2295,"SIX, in the slot and out of the park. 500th six of the tournament. Loops it up in the arc for batsman, no turn. batsman lowers his stance and launches it over cow corner"
2296,"1 run, hunches forward and sweetly drives it to long-off. 50-stand up between the two"
2297,"SIX, what a shot. The googly from Soni, but pitches it up fuller outside off. batsman isn't sparing those. Flexes his arms and murders it straight over the bowler's head for a maximum"
2298,"FOUR, clumsy from Smithy. Makes a royal mess of this one. batsman blasts it hard off the back foot through extra cover. Smithy gets across, slides near the ropes but lets it through his boot laces. Into the fence"
2299,"SIX, fifty for batsman. Reaches the landmark in style. A rank long hop from bowler, batsman is onto it in a flash. Skips back and smokes it away into the deep mid-wicket stands. 14 runs off the over"
2300,"SIX, ugly from Soni. Perhaps, took a cue from his skipper. Half-tracker, sits up nicely for batsman. He gets under it and clubs it over deep mid-wicket"
2301,"SIX, brilliant. Soni floats it up full, batsman is ready for it. Unleashes his muscles and dumps it over the bowler's head for a maximum. Raina walks up immediately and consoles the bowler"
2302,"FOUR, turn straightaway for bowler and he finds the outside edge. Smith was on the front foot to defend, the turn took the thick outside edge of the bat and it flew past the man at slip. The Lions are off the mark"
2303,"FOUR, that's swept away over backward square leg and it's four more. Turns out to be a good start for Smith and Gujarat. This was a delivery down the leg-side, Smith sweeps, gets a bit of top edge but he swung hard to send it over the infield"
2304,"out Caught by Pant!! A peach from bowler. He recorded the worst bowling figures of the season the other night (4-0-59-0), but he's started with a lovely nut tonight. The hard-hitting Baz McCullum is walking back with just a solitary run to his name. bowler angled this short of length delivery into the right-hander from wide of the crease, the ball moved away late, just enough movement to take the outside edge of McCullum's bat as he was looking to defend away from the body. Pant dives to his right and takes a good catch. batsman c Pant b bowler 1(3)"
2305,"out Dwayne Smith Run Out!! This is disaster for Gujarat Lions. Both the openers gone in successive balls. Who is to be blamed here? batsman took a couple of steps out of his crease after playing this ball gently to mid-wicket, Smith thought the skipper was keen on a run, but was shocked when batsman stopped suddenly. The West Indian tried to rush back but a bullet throw from Nadeem meant his bat was on the line when the stumps were disturbed. Dwayne Smith run out (Nadeem) 9(4) [4s-2]"
2306,"SIX, no sir! Don't bowl there, he'll thrash you even in his sleep. When it's full and that front leg is out of the way, he hardly misses out on the slog. He was down on one knee and smashed this over mid-wicket"
2307,"SIX, once again bowler errs on the fuller side and batsman is not afraid to hit the ball in the air. Hits it very straight and ensures that long-off and long-on were not in the picture"
2308,"SIX, every time the spinners have dropped it short, batsman has done very well to rock back, make excellent use of the crease and pull it handsomely over mid-wicket. This had a lot of hang time on it"
2309,"SIX, wowww! The shot of the day for me! The greatest thing about this shot was batsman didn't manage to get close to the pitch of the ball after jumping down the pitch, yet went through the lofted inside-out drive and sent it over the cover boundary"
2310,"FOUR, the slog-sweep, in the air, but batsman has split the fielders in the deep. Deep mid-wicket and deep backward square leg thought they were in the business for a moment. batsman got down low on his knees and timed it well enough"
2311,"SIX, batsman is turning the heat on. Not off the middle, but batsman won't mind as he got enough wood on his hook against this short ball that sails over the long leg fence"
2312,"1 run, uses his wrists and directs this short of length delivery on the pads through mid-wicket for a single which brings up his 14th IPL fifty!"
2313,"FOUR, magnificent shot to start the over! bowler serves width outside off, batsman leans forward and biffs the drive over Karun Nair at extra cover. Once it cleared him, there was none stopping that"
2314,"out Raina Run Out!! Direct hit and the skipper has to walk back. bowler bowls one in the blockhole just outside off, batsman squirts it out to backward point. Raina wanted a quick single and is halfway down. That's when he saw his partner who wasn't interested in the run. Rabada finds the target direct and Raina is well short. The 133-run partnership has been broken. Raina run out (Rabada) 77(43) [4s-5 6s-4]"
2315,"FOUR, shot! On the pads to any sub-continent batsman, he won't spare you. He moves slightly across and middles the leg-glance. The quick Delhi outfield does the rest"
2316,"SIX, wow! Brilliantly played. It was short and wide outside off, batsman waits for it and slashes it. Didn't bother to keep it down and up she goes. Over backward point and the ball sails over the boundary rope"
2317,"FOUR, 19 runs off the over! batsman is underway in a grand style. It was bowled on the stumps, but overpitched. batsman blasts the straight drive. The ball bullets away into the fence"
2318,"out Caught by Corey Anderson!! That's a screamer! Corey Anderson has taken the catch of the tournament. DK has to go. Cummins darts a scrambled seam delivery on a fullish length just outside off. With mid-off inside the circle, the lofted off-drive shot was on. batsman goes for it, but couldn't quite get the required timing. His bat turns at the point of impact. The Kiwi all-rounder at mid-off, times his jump to perfection and plucks it with his left hand. The ball had almost gone past him. batsman c Corey Anderson b bowler 65(34) [4s-5 6s-5]"
2319,"FOUR, ah! Got to feel for the bowler. batsman was in no control of that shot, still gets a boundary. Quick short ball that keeps following batsman, who moved leg-side. The ball gets big on him. The batsman, with his eyes closed, goes for the pull. The ball pops up and flies wide of short fine and runs away into the fence"
2320,"out Caught by Shreyas Iyer!! The scratchy knock from the youngster comes to an end. He never looked comfortable in his brief stay. Kishan doesn't spot the off-cutter and is early to swipe it across the line. The top edge balloons up high in the air. Sheyas Iyer, from long-on, runs forward and takes a good skier. batsman c Shreyas Iyer b bowler 4(6)"
2321,"FOUR, that's a good shot! The batsman seemed to have been deceived by the short ball. He adjusted well, jumped and pulled fiercely through mid-wicket"
2322,"FOUR, trademark batsman shot! Backs away and reaches for this fullish ball outside off. Carves it inside out over extra cover. Mid-off is up and there is none to stop that"
2323,"out Caught by Pant!! batsman is gone! Excellent catch by Pant. batsman moves leg-side and bowler follows him with a sharp bouncer. He isn't in the greatest of positions, but still persists with his pull shot and gets a top edge. The ball lobs up very high. The keeper runs back and calls for it. Nadeem was also approaching towards him from short fine leg. The ball swirls around as it drops down. Pant holds his nerve and dives full-stretched and gobbles it cleanly. batsman c Pant b bowler 27(19) [4s-4]"
2324,"out Caught by (sub)Brathwaite!! Gone! Trying to play the big shot, batsman perishes. It was a slow short ball on the stumps. batsman spots it and pulls it. He went at it hard and ended up hitting it flat. Brathwaite at deep square leg, stoops low and catches it safely with both hands. batsman c (sub)Brathwaite b bowler 1(2)"
2325,"SIX, that's a monster! Full and right in the slot for batsman to swing his bat hard. Jaddu stands tall and biffs it over long-on for a gigantic six"
2326,"1 run, it's dropped this time. Gee, this is a crazy over. Two wickets, one just escaped the fielder and then one was put down. This time bowler does what most fast bowlers with pace do to batsman. Bowl that bouncer and have him jumping around in the crease. It was down the leg-side, batsman could back away or duck, tried to pull, the ball went off the back of the bat, a lob it was to first slip. Easiest of chances, but Shreyas Iyer spills it. bowler is very disappointed"
2327,"FOUR, uppish, but not convincing. Short of a length delivery on the leg stump, batsman chips it over the infield, more towards square leg, luckily for the visitors, the ball went in the gap"
2328,"SIX, highest ever total for Gujarat Lions! batsman finishes the innings in style. That's Dhoni-esque. Slower shortish ball. batsman waits and waits for it to come to him and smacks the pull over deep mid-wicket. 17 runs off the final over"
2329,"SIX, why on earth did they remove Rabada after that brilliant over? batsman was never comfortable against him. This Delhi team does strange things! bowler serves up a length ball on the leg stump, batsman is good when he connects those slogs and he has done decently well this time, flew over wide mid-on"
2330,"FOUR, the short ball but batsman backed away early to free his arms. Slashed at it with an open bat face to deliberately hit over the top through point for four"
2331,"FOUR, this man is great with his inside-out lofted drives over the cover region. Can't really say that this is a bad ball from the bowler. Middle and leg line on a good length, batsman moved leg-side and played that easily over extra-cover"
2332,"SIX, no problems with connecting this one from the middle of the bat. Length ball right in the slot and he's in the mood to swing at everything, lofts down the ground, goes over mid-on and goes all the way. Somehow, batsman has raced to 33 off 17 balls"
2333,"FOUR, that's a lovely piece of timing from batsman. Should get him going. Not easy to jump down the pitch to a pacy bowler. In fact this came down at 148kph, batsman made it into a fuller length by using his feet and played an excellent off-drive, the dive goes in vain from mid-off"
2334,"FOUR, stylish from batsman. So after a terribly scratchy start, batsman has managed to settle nicely. Poor full delivery on the pads, deserved to be put away, batsman moved across the sticks just a touch to open up the backward square leg boundary and he placed the flick shot wide of the man at short fine to sign off the over in style"
2335,"2 runs, dropped. This is turning out to be the kind of knock he played against team very early in the tournament. This was in the slot for the batsman, batsman teed off with a slog, went at a catchable height to mid-wicket, although it was hit with power, Samules tried to grab it above his head but it popped out"
2336,"FOUR, gee, what placement! Deliberately swung hard at it with an open bat face to send it through point. This was the googly from bowler, making it a risky shot against the incoming ball, but the fact that it was too full made his life easy."
2337,"SIX, the googly again, but it's way too short. batsman jumps on the back foot, times the pull well enough to send it high in the air and over the mid-wicket boundary. A poor over that from bowler, bowled well to Raina, but was very poor with his length to batsman"
2338,"2 runs, worked away off the back foot into the vacant mid-wicket region and that's a fifty for batsman, his 31st in the IPL. Pressure clearly back on Delhi, despite a dream start"
2339,"FOUR, and Mishy continues to struggle against the right-hander, very strange through. He is so unwilling to toss the ball up and has hardly made batsman play off the front foot. It's a short delivery that turns away, batsman cuts well through point and beats the sweeper's dive on the boundary"
2340,"out Caught by Kedar Jadhav!! Clear nick, no appeal from the bowler, even the keeper didn't hear the edge, but batsman walks. Well done sir! It's been short of length from Aniket all over, this time he bowls it slightly wide outside off stump than the previous ones, batsman throws his hands at it to cut it away for four but gets a faint edge. Not sure if the umpire heard that nick too. Would have been interesting if batsman had not walked. Just the start team didn't want in a crunch game. batsman c Kedar Jadhav b bowler 1(3)"
2341,"FOUR, this is one ground that he can make it big if he gets his eye in. The boundaries are short and even mishits can go all the way. bowler bowled a fuller length and just outside off stump, batsman lofted it over cover, didn't come from the middle of the bat, but good enough for a one-bounce four"
2342,"FOUR, wow! Lovely piece of timing. bowler bowls full in search of swing, it did swing away a touch, but Marsh was nicely forward to cream the cover drive from the middle of the bat"
2343,"out Caught by de Villiers!! Something had to give and it is a wicket. The sea of red flags flutter around the Chinnaswamy. Another set batsmen doesn't bat through the innings. Nice loop on this leggie, batsman's eyes lit up and he went to send it into the second tier, cleared his front leg to heave and mistimed it towards long-on. The ball hung in the air for a long time before AB reverse cupped it calmly. batsman c de Villiers b bowler 25(28) [4s-1 6s-1]"
2344,"FOUR, was that a drop? bowler is not a happy man. The reverse sweep from Maxi and he almost picked out backward point. Aniket is a tall man and he did get a fingertip on it. It was struck fiercely and Aniket did not have much time to react"
2345,"byes, FOUR, what was Kedar Jadhav doing? batsman was beaten all ends up, tees off for a big mow to the leg-side, the ball goes on straight to beat him on the inside edge. Jadhav didn't even try to get his gloves behind the ball"
2346,"byes, FOUR, Kedar Jadhav is having a torrid time behind the wicket. Flighted just outside off, batsman drives and misses, he was undone by the lack of bounce and Jadhav is nutmegged. He should have had his legs together"
2347,"out Caught by Badree!! Oh no! batsman has been caught but the umpire is checking for a no-ball. It is touch and go. GO it is for batsman. Looked really close and the benefit of doubt has gone to the bowler on this occasion. Nicely tossed up delivery and batsman brings out the switch-hit. The top edge skies towards short third man, it was a tough one and the experienced Samuel Badree pouches it and puffs his cheeks. He knew it was a steepler and needed to his eyes on the ball till the last second. batsman c Badree b bowler 6(11) [4s-1]"
2348,"SIX, floated up on a fuller length and batsman says thank you very much. A much needed six for team. batsman plonks his front foot forward and hammers the loft with the turn over long-on"
2349,"FOUR, good batting from batsman. A no risk shot this. Waited for the ball to arrive, used whatever pace was available and steered it fine, Badree had no chance at short third man"
2350,"FOUR, Gayle at backward point and Badree at third man, you don't expect them to chase a ball down. Slower delivery and batsman relied on placing it behind point rather than knocking the cover off the ball. No chance for both the fielders"
2351,"out Bowled!! Third batsman out in the 20s. bowler has a wicket and has his finger up in delight. Wicket-to-wicket stuff from Watto, batsman made room to glide it behind point, was beaten for pace and the ball kissed the off-pole. Crucial wicket for the home side as batsman was looking to get on with proceedings. The off-cutter that skidded off the surface. batsman b bowler 21(25) [4s-1]"
2352,"FOUR, bad delivery and deserved the treatment. Short and wide, Mohit threw the whole kitchen sink at that, sliced it off the outside edge to third man, got it fine enough and beat Aravind to the fence"
2353,"out Caught by Kedar Jadhav!! This time Kedar Jadhav appealed and so did Aniket, the umpire obliges to their plea. Nothing but a short of length delivery angled across the right-hander, Mohit pulled and got an under edge to the keeper. batsman c Kedar Jadhav b bowler 6(4) [4s-1]"
2354,"SIX, massive hit! Makes a dent on the ad hoardings on the roof. Right in the arc - length delivery and outside off, batsman clears his front leg and heaves it all the way over long-on. Needs to play all the six balls"
2355,"FOUR, batsman seems to be having no problems on a surface where others have struggled. Short delivery on leg-stump, batsman pivots on his front leg and pulls it backward of square, couple of bounces and into the fence. 12 off the first three balls"
2356,"FOUR, turning out to be just the over team needed. Kohli is furious at long-off. Kicks the ball back onto the ad boardings. Pitched up and batsman slams it straight down the ground. No chance for Kohli at long-off"
2357,"out Caught by Negi!! This was coming. All Kohli needed to do was have a man at sweeper cover. It's very difficult for a right-handed batsman to middle the ball against the away-going ball from a left-handed bowler on a slowish pitch when he is trying to loft on the off-side. batsman wanted to go over mid-off, but lack of pace on the ball meant the bat turned in his hands on impact with the ball. Ended up slicing it and it's a simple grab for Negi. Credit to bowler for bowling the slower ball. This is a very sluggish start from team. 18/2 and we are into the fourth over. batsman c Negi b bowler 9(10) [4s-1]"
2358,"FOUR, gee, how quickly did that reach the fence? bowler bowls a gentle full ball outside off stump, Marsh crashes it through cover and picks up a boundary"
2359,"FOUR, that's lovely placement. No one at third man, he was actually inside the ring, so any width from the bowler is going to be easy, Marsh opened the bat face and nicely guided it past the man at 45"
2360,"FOUR, oh this one kept low and it's very unlucky for the bowler that the ball has gone for four despite taking the inside edge of the bat. This was the slider on the shorter side, batsman went back to pull, the ball didn't rise, went off the inner part and split short fine leg and backward square leg to perfection"
2361,"out Caught by Mandeep!! bowler has got a big wicket and team's team owner Preity Zinta is not happy in the stands. On a slowish pitch, a set batsman has to carry on, but in trying to up the ante and with the thought of taking on the left-arm spinner, Marsh has holed out. It's 39 for 3 and the visitors are in deep trouble. Clever bowling from bowler. He knew that anything full and on the stumps would make it easy for Marsh to target mid-wicket, he bowled this full and wide outside off stump, forced Marsh to fetch and it's a mistimed hit to long-off. batsman c Mandeep b bowler 20(17) [4s-3]"
2362,"SIX, he's a good striker of the cricket ball and bowler erred in his length. Too full and allowed the batsman to get under the ball, batsman was down on one knee to smash it over the leaping long-on fielder"
2363,"out Caught by Guptill!! Had to happen. If you read the last delivery's description, you would know. Didn't use his feet to a fullish ball, so he shimmies out this time to compensate. The length's been nicely shortened by Sharma, and also gets it to move away. The result: batsman is down the track and slices an outside edge to gully -- yes, there was one, for batsman. Comeback done and dusted. batsman c Guptill b bowler 0(2)"
2364,"FOUR, first ball. Shuffles and kills the inswing with a whippy clip, embarrassing us for all the bottom hand strength we don't have. Plays it real fine behind the wicket and gets a first-ball boundary to get off the mark"
2365,"SIX, gosh, no! A short ball down leg and batsman had helped the pull over fine leg with utter nonchalance. And given how slow this pitch is, bouncers aren't exactly themselves. They are friends"
2366,"FOUR, this was half a cut at best. Jabbed the ball through covers. Natarajan angles this away, Singh stays put and caresses it away"
2367,"FOUR, inside edge runs away. Had to shuffle here to get behind this ball angled away. Instead stays there and looks to fetch it, getting an inside edge much to keeper's left in the process"
2368,"out Caught by Saha!! This is the fifth time bowler Patel has dismissed Watto in IPL, the most he has dismissed any batsman. Just wow! A quicker flatter dart outside off, from Jaddu's book you would think. batsman goes deep inside the crease to flay it square, feeds the faintest of nicks to the keeper. batsman c Saha b bowler 3(6)"
2369,"out Bowled!! Maxi roars. team fans are absolutely shattered. One guy has ran out of expressions, he just tweaks his hair while giving THAT WHAT.THE.____ expression! Oh boy! Things going bad to worse for team. No real turn, just stump-to-stump channel and fired it flat, batsman rocks back to pull, a big swish across the line. Misses by a long way and the middle pole takes the pasting. batsman b bowler 46(40) [4s-5 6s-2]"
2370,"FOUR, skates down the pitch, stays leg-side of the delivery and carves Varun bowler over extra cover. The batsman in batsman speaks..."
2371,"out Lbw!! Maxi is having fun out there. He is picking wickets like the way he knocks the switch-hits. 7 down now. batsman crouches and looks to sweep Maxi through square leg, doesn't pick the line, neither the length. Strikes him low around off and that's smashing into middle. batsman lbw b bowler 4(6)"
2372,"FOUR, full and wide, batsman twitches his back knee and throws the kitchen sink, a big-blooded edge flies away to the third man fence"
2373,"leg byes, FOUR, the rib-tickler. With fine leg inside the ring, not sure if that's a great idea. batsman hops and misses the tickle, the slow-low nature of the pitch means it shoots a bit low to take the thigh pad en route to fine leg fancy boards"
2374,"out Caught by Saha!! Three fielders converge for the catch and Saha pouches it safely. Not before a bit of collision though. Natarajan aborted himself at the last second and evaded the dash, but Aaron and Saha didn't. In the end, Saha accepts while gliding into Varun Aaron who was running from backward point. It was a pull that never took off, off the splice of the bat. And then all the drama batsman c Saha b bowler 21(23) [4s-2]"
2375,out Bowled!! Knocked him over! Down on one knee looking to thump bowler into MG Road. You miss I hit. Knocks the head of off peg. batsman b bowler 8(9)
2376,out Caught by Guptill!! That's the final nail in the coffin. This is the lowest ever total defended at this venue. team needed to win this badly and they did so with great ease. Fast bowler to fast bolwer. Result? He slaps hard and picks out Guptill at mid-off. Had only so much power. Alas! batsman c Guptill b bowler 4(6)
2377,"out Bowled!! Go Sandeep, make a GIF out of this and retire. Virat batsman's been done. Sees batsman shimmy out and still keeps it straight at the stumps. batsman overruns, letting the ball sneak through and timbah. The trick was that Sharma stuck to a normal pace delivery. batsman would have connected had it been a slower one. Wasn't and bam, batsman is gone. batsman b bowler 6(6) [4s-1]"
2378,"FOUR, hence proven: Guptill has spring in his shoes. Hey ICC, are you watching? Cut but it's more off the edge, thanks to the bounce, and Guptill has almost gotten to it at backward point. Well almost. My commentary has been adulterated by my fanboyism, so maybe. But he really jumped there, and tumbling as he fell on the ground. Good to watch but batsman gets four runs here"
2379,"FOUR, goes full this ball and that's been smacked delightly, delicately through the other side of the wicket -- Sandeep is from over the wicket to AB here. Takes the ball on the up and disparages it away"
2380,"SIX, umm, you aren't a cricket binge-watcher if you didn't see this coming. Dropped short, and AB has smacked it into the oblivion. Over deep mid-wicket. You would envy how early AB sees things, cricket lengths here. Got into the position beautifully and swatted it away"
2381,"out Caught by Saha!! bowler has Chris Gayle, Virat Kohli and AB batsman off consecutive overs. Now that's something to roast others about, in your white picket-fenced villa that you buy from your IPL contract. So, coming back to reality, AB was shimmying out of his crease, high on confidence of bullying the last ball for a six. What Sandeep does is to keep it full but just about adjusts the line to something further outside off. AB gets an edge on the charge and the keeper does so well to anticipate it all and move to his right to pouch that. Big wicket, team stuttering. batsman c Saha b bowler 10(6) [4s-1 6s-1]"
2382,"FOUR, good shot. Sees the length short and pulls it up and over the infield. Clears it easily for a boundary"
2383,"FOUR, what he's done here is ruled out Guptill at backward point. Hit it over him, and wide of him. Short and wide, talls up and cuts it ferociously. Powerplay done: 46 for 3"
2384,"out Caught by Axar!! That's just Mohit playing with the length. And his knuckles, maybe. Clocks 134ks but gets the ball to hold in the pitch, as Kedar charges out in ambition. Tries to check his shot but ends up slicing it off the splice to short cover. Kedar wanted to go leg-side, and go big, but was hoaxed by the ball never arriving at all. Where are we headed? More importantly, where are team? batsman c Axar b bowler 6(6) [4s-1]"
2385,"FOUR, to be a cutter or to not be a cutter, that isn't the question. This was wide, and it's been cut away through backward point. Life's simple"
2386,"SIX, clobbered over mid-wicket. Stays put, and waits for the ball to arrive, before laying into a delicate bat-swing over cow corner"
2387,"out batsman Run Out!! A waste. A sheer waste. A nothing line this from bowler, down leg and batsman helps it out to short fine courtesy his clip. Nothing wrong with that. Just that he wants the single desperately after that - something Rahane declines making him return from his adventures half way down the track. A direct hit and you do not need to disturb the third umpire for these. Had given up. Oh what a waste of form. batsman run out (Bipul Sharma) 1(4)"
2388,"SIX, batsman has seen enough. Decides to up the ante and succeeds. Lowers his stance to reach the ball, unleashes his strong muscles and thumps it over deep mid-wicket"
2389,"SIX, two in two! Left-arm spin against batsman? Not a good idea. He takes a step forward this time, wasn't quite to the pitch but he extends his long levers to butcher it into the deep mid-wicket stands"
2390,"SIX, batsman is teeing off. Third six off Bipul. Spots the shorter ball early, skips back and flat-bats it over long-on"
2391,"2 runs, common-sense cricket from batsman. Knocks it away into the leg-side and comes back for the second without breaking a sweat"
2392,"FOUR, oh my word! You don't often see a batsman play the reverse-hit to a fast bowler. But batsman does the unthinkable. Sees the short of length delivery early, changes his grip and swats it over point. Outrageous!"
2393,"out Bowled!! Got him. Rashid takes matter on his own hands and castles batsman. Flatter ball, extracted just a bit of turn back in, batsman sanked down for a blindfold slog, misses and sees his stumps rattled. Much needed breakthrough for team. batsman b bowler 39(25) [4s-1 6s-3]"
2394,"out Caught by Bipul Sharma!! Bipul Sharma has resurrected his karma charts. This should've happened much earlier. He dropped batsman earlier off the same bowler but washes off all the sins now. A very full ball outside off, batsman tried to be smart, opened the bat face and looked to flay it in the pocket between point and short third man. But fails in his endeavour. Picks out Bipul, who settles under it and roars in delight. batsman c Bipul Sharma b bowler 34(39)"
2395,"FOUR, batsman is off the mark with a boundary. Would you believe it? This is only the second boundary of the innings. A juicy half volley outside off, batsman leans forward and creams it through extra cover"
2396,"out Caught by Rashid Khan!! Two wickets in three balls for team. What a turnaround. One shot too many for batsman. It was swerving in on off, batsman wanted to go over long-on but messes up his timing. Skews it off the splice and sends it high towards long-on. Rashid Khan runs in and pouches it safely. Too easy for him. batsman c Rashid Khan b bowler 4(2) [4s-1]"
2397,"FOUR, a boundary to cap off the over. A short of length delivery outside off, Tiwary reaches out and places it behind point. No chance for the third man fielder"
2398,"FOUR, bad idea Kumar. Arrows it on leg-stump line, batsman swivels 360 and hacks it over square leg"
2399,"SIX, batsman has found his elements. A short ball without any purpose, sits up nicely for batsman. He rocks back and muscles the pull over deep mid-wicket. The crowd aren't willing to return the ball. So, the fourth umpire has arrived with a set of replacements"
2400,"SIX, you miss the length, you will get punished. The idea was good from Kumar, but the execution was horrible. Fullish outside off, batsman throws his weight across and bullies it over extra cover. A flat six"
2401,"out batsman Run Out!! 1 run completed. Horrible mix-up and Tiwary has to depart. A total communication breakdown between Tiwary and Dhoni. A fuller length delivery on the stumps, Tiwary pushes it towards long-off and set off for the second. Dhoni showed signs of interest but on seeing the fielder rush onto the ball, he sent back Tiwary and sold him down the river. The Bengal batsman had no chance of returning back once he took off. batsman run out (Warner/bowler) 9(5) [4s-1]"
2402,"FOUR, such a calculative shot from batsman. Kaul angled this slower ball outside off, batsman throws his bat to his fullest and gets it over point. Not off the middle but he won't mind"
2403,"out Caught by Naman Ojha!! End of batsman blitz. But he has done the damage. Very full ball on the stumps, batsman swung hard at that, fails to find the sweet spot. Some curl in the air must've done him. Edges it behind and Ojha makes no mistake. batsman c Naman Ojha b bowler 31(21) [4s-2 6s-2]"
2404,"out Caught by Warner!! Safe as houses. If Davy Warner is in the vicinity, you can tuck your arms and walk off. You will rarely see him put a catch down. Two in two for Kaul and he is on a hat-trick. Looked like the slower ball, hurled it wide of off, Thakur meekly chipped it down the ground. Finds long-off and the team skipper calmly gobbles it up. batsman c Warner b bowler 0(1)"
2405,"1 run, put down. Oh Bipul Sharma. Neutralizes all the work he did with Tripathi's dismissal with a horrific piece of catching. At the same position - short fine. batsman fetches it off his pads and fails to keep the glance down finding the man at 45 behind square to perfection. Gets both hands to it over his eyeline and watches it fluff out"
2406,"SIX, piles on his luck. Unleashes the first boundary of the day clearing his front leg, walking into the line and down in executing the full bat swing as he clinically dispatches it with a tonk over long-on. All timing"
2407,"out Caught by Yuvraj!! Sweeps and sweeps his way to his doom. Bipul has some sort of a revenge. Keeps flighting it up inviting the aggression. Gets it in the form of an uncontrolled sweep. batsman doesn't really reach out, takes one hand off the handle as well as he top-edges it to a running in Yuvi from the square leg fence. The second time Bipul has batsman's number this season. batsman c Yuvraj b bowler 22(20) [6s-1]"
2408,"1 run, another life. At short fine leg again. This time it is Bhuvi Kumar playing godfather. batsman seems keen on his walking flicks, once again doesn't keep it down and gives Bhuvi a chance with a dive to his left. In the palms and popping out"
2409,"FOUR, lovely shot, poor ball from bowler, short and wide of off, batsman reached out and cracks it in front of square on the off-side. Rahane moved across to his left, put in the dive, but the ball was always wide of him"
2410,"FOUR, batsman has come out aggressively. Someone might have told him that the Indian team for Champions Trophy might be selected tomorrow. bowler shortened the length as he spotted batsman running down the track, makes room and slaps it over cover. Rahane has no chance in the deep"
2411,"FOUR, calculated risk from batsman. First ball from a new bowler, mid-off inside the ring and batsman was walking down the pitch, extends his arms and lifts it over the fielder, couple of bounces and into the fence"
2412,"out Caught by SN Thakur!! And that's why he was brought back. Huge moment in the game. Third wicket for team and all three have been from bowler. Nothing special about this delivery. Short and outside off, batsman was on the hop trying to play the cut, does not bother to keep it down and picks out the sweeper to perfection. He was aiming to go over point and got it a lot squarer than he would have liked. batsman c SN Thakur b bowler 40(34) [4s-4 6s-1]"
2413,"2 runs, direct hit and batsman was struggling. bowler sprays one down the leg-side from round the wicket, batsman wanted to play his favourite pick-up shot over backward square, right off the cue-end and to deep mid-wicket, Unadkat get the angle and released the ball quickly. Dhoni also failed to collect the ball. Had he even deflected it onto the stumps, batsman was a goner"
2414,"SIX, class! Everything right about this shot. Just a pleasing sight to see batsman smack a six straight back over the bowler. Fuller and on the stumps, the full face of the bat comes to the fore and then the extension of the arms to send it sailing over the rope"
2415,"out Bowled!! bowler is off. Game on! The wrong 'un from bowler, batsman certainly did not pick it as he went back to play the cut shot, the ball spun back in and got the under edge, deflected onto the stumps. bowler is off on his sprint. Almost ends up near deep square leg. Two wickets in succession and the game is back in balance. batsman b bowler 4(6)"
2416,"FOUR, that is cricket. A chance off the last ball followed by a boundary. Flighted delivery on a fullish length, righth in the arc for batsman, who heaves it to the deep mid-wicket fence. Placed it expertly"
2417,"SIX, much needed hit for team. Short delivery and not much pace to trouble batsman, was bowled at 120kph and sat up nicely, batsman pulls it off the front foot into the deep square leg stand"
2418,out Caught by Tripathi!! Wow! Is that the game? bowler certainly thinks so. Pumps his fist in excitement. The off-cutter on a shortish length. They have been bowling that all evening. batsman goes for the cut and like Warner does not have the power to get it over the man sweeping. Tripathi runs to his right and takes a well-judged catch. batsman has some advice for the incoming Bipul Sharma. batsman c Tripathi b bowler 47(43) [4s-4 6s-2]
2419,"SIX, Ojha can strike the ball. So, team fans, hang in there. bowler switches to round the wicket and dishes out a slower delivery on a length, Ojha swings as hard as possible and sends it over long-on. Got plenty of height and for a second might have thought he was in trouble, but Christian was reduced to a spectator"
2420,"out Caught by Stokes!! You just can't keep Stokes out of the action. Second wicket in the over for bowler and he might have just won team the game. Another one of his cutters outside off, Ojha went for the loft over long-off, since the ball gripped the surface it took the outer half of the bat and skied towards sweeper cover. Stokes made no mistake. Bit of silence around the ground now. batsman c Stokes b bowler 9(9) [6s-1]"
2421,"out Caught by Stokes!! Dot followed by a wicket. Stokes with another catch. He's been everywhere today. The slower delivery and Bipul picked it early this time around, went with the angle towards deep square leg. Made a decent connection as well but the big side boundaries don't fetch him a six. Stokes steadies himself near deep square leg and pouches it with ease. bowler has a smile on his face. batsman c Stokes b bowler 8(7)"
2422,"out Caught&Bowled!! Fourth wicket for bowler. He's on a hat-trick. Another batsman falls prey to the slower delivery. The key with the off-pace delivery is that you have to hit the right length and bowler has managed to do that, Rashid went for the loft and only managed to cue-end beside the pitch. bowler runs across and reverse cups it. batsman c and b bowler 3(4)"
2423,"out Caught by Manoj Tiwary!! There it is. Third hat-trick of the season. He is chuffed to bits. Is almost on his knees celebrating the occasion. Also, reaches 100 wickets in T20s. Once more the off-speed delivery on back of a length, batsman stayed leg-side and tried to flat-bat it, spliced it towards extra cover and Tiwary made no mistake. He's been terrifich with his slower balls. batsman c Manoj Tiwary b bowler 0(1)"
2424,"SIX, batsman is looking in good touch, length delivery outside off, he was quick to shuffle across, gets into a good position and heaves it over the mid-wicket fence"
2425,"out Bowled!! bowler strikes first ball, did the ball stay a bit low? bowler wouldn't complain though. He came from round the wicket and angled one back into the left-hander, batsman was lazy in getting forward, his bat came down way too late - but by that time the ball had gone past him and pegged the off-stump back. bowler exults in delight, batsman was looking in good touch, but it's only a cameo from him today. batsman b bowler 19(12) [4s-2 6s-1]"
2426,"FOUR, edged and four, a juicy full-toss from bowler, might have slipped out of his hands. batsman was startled as he pushed at that, gets a thick edge that rolls away past the keeper and into the fence. An immediate apology from bowler, but that wasn't dangerous"
2427,"out Caught by Dhoni!! bowler is pulling his team back into the contest once again. He did with the bat earlier, he now has two in an over. This is a huge wicket, KW was the man who could have anchored the chase on this pitch, he's been done in by some extra bounce. Was late in getting forward on the drive, the ball seamed just enough to catch the shoulder of the bat - a bit of glove as well and MS doesn't drop those. batsman c Dhoni b bowler 4(2) [4s-1]"
2428,"FOUR, a gift and batsman gleefully accepts! Short and wide from bowler, batsman climbs into the cut and deposits it over cover, a couple of bounces and the ball rolls into the ad hoarding"
2429,"FOUR, that's a good comeback from batsman, tossed up on the stumps, he gets down low and sweeps it over square leg, no need to run for those"
2430,"FOUR, lovely, batsman is getting into the act now, slower and just outside off, he gets forward, opens the face of the bat at the last moment and finds the gap past extra-cover, beats mid-off and rolls away to the fence"
2431,"FOUR, cracking shot, this is good batting from batsman, he's beginning to read Sundar now, tossed up on the stumps, he gets well forward and lifts it back over the bowler's head, one bounce and over the ropes"
2432,"SIX, cracking shot, this was the leg-break, but the line was too full, allowed batsman to get underneath the ball and lift it back over his head, went all the way for the first maximum of the chase, for batsman"
2433,"1 run, was that a chance? Yes, it was - a tough chance but you need to grab those when you are defending a low score. This was dropped short by bowler, batsman swivelled across on the pull, didn't bothered to keep it down. It was travelling and to his left, Sundar went with both hands, got to the ball but can't hold on. On the second viewing, it was closer to him, should take those at this level"
2434,"FOUR, edged and four, more luck for batsman, full and wide of off from Shardul. batsman saw the width and threw his hands at that, gets a thick edge that flies past Dhoni and into the fence"
2435,"FOUR, creamed, width on offer from Shardul, batsman leans into the shot and drives it to the left of extra-cover. It was in the air but was perfectly placed as well, no chance for the fielder at mid-off"
2436,"out Caught by Simmons!! This is not how you climb a Mt Everest. This is not the start you dream of. A fuller ball and batsman swings across the line. Wants to dominate with ball one. The bat turns a bit in the hands, taking the power off the shot. Carries to the man at deep square leg. The fielder moves a bit to his right and grabs that with ease. batsman c Simmons b bowler 0(1)"
2437,"out Caught by Harbhajan!! Not for once in this innings did he look at ease and eventually hands a dolly to Harbhajan at mid-wicket. Short ball, batsman is clearly done in by the pace. Is late on the pull, the ball hits the splice and skies. Second one down for Delhi. They are not helping their cause. The move to send him up the order falls on its face. 150 wickets in the IPL for the great Sri Lankan. batsman c Harbhajan b bowler 3(6)"
2438,"SIX, that is a good hit! Slogs with the turn and hits it well over the long-on fence. 91 metre hit that"
2439,"out Caught by Pollard!! Goes with the turn again. No, not really. It is the attempted doosra from Bhajji. Does not turn much but does the trick, batsman miscues the big loft. Pollard gets under it at long-on and pushes Delhi closer to embarrassment. batsman c Pollard b bowler 7(4) [6s-1]"
2440,out Caught by Nitish Rana!! Delhi lose by 146 runs and it's an IPL record. batsman tries to clear the straight boundary but mistimes in the air for Nitish Rana to run across from long-on and catch it. Juggled a few times but managed to hold on. batsman c Nitish Rana b bowler 2(11)
2441,"FOUR, cheeky and effective. Makes a bit of room to this shortish ball that was going across him, guides it over the slip fielder, who is fairly wide. Third man too is in the ring"
2442,"FOUR, the swipe that Delhi batsmen have been attempting to no avail. But this time he has got a bit of bat on it. The delivery was slower than usual, might have helped his cause. Hits over mid-wicket and fetches a four"
2443,"SIX, sound! Often that is an indication of the timing. batsman clubs the length ball over mid-wicket. Looked a bit early on the shot but manages to put more than enough behind the shot to power it over the lurking fielder at the boundary"
2444,"out Caught by Simmons!! You got to look at batsman. He cannot believe it. Looks dejected. As if has been robbed of hope. The scoreboard pressure gets the better of him. A shortish ball that he tries to help with the pull, does not quite manoeuvre it well. Ends up hitting in the air at deep mid-wicket. The fielder onrushes a few yards and accepts the offer. batsman c Simmons b bowler 0(3)"
2445,"FOUR, wickets are tumbling at one end but batsman continues to impress. Arches back to this short ball and ramps it over the keeper. A couple of bounces and into the fence"
2446,"FOUR, starts round the wicket and gets it to turn a bit around off. batsman goes back to cut, the ball keeps a bit low and takes the under edge. Goes between the legs of Parthiv. Bumrah, from short fine leg, gives the chase for a while before the ball beats him to the fence"
2447,"out Caught by Rohit!! Now batsman departs. Wheels coming off the chase. batsman, like the previous occasion, stepped down again. This time bowler is smart enough to shorten the length. However, that does not deter batsman who goes with the shot, whips it well but does not get the elevation. Rohit Sharma at mid-wicket leaps a bit and plucks it. batsman c Rohit b bowler 21(15) [4s-3 6s-1]"
2448,"FOUR, drags the mighty heave from around off. For a moment he seemed to have found mid-wicket. But it was in the gap between mid-wicket and mid-on"
2449,"out Caught by Karn Sharma!! Short ball and it devours batsman. He was trying to make some room but saw that the line was pretty close to his body. Decided to go for the pull, but the ball skid on. Could not get enough power behind the shot and found long-on to his left. batsman c Karn Sharma b bowler 10(8) [4s-2]S"
2450,"out Caught by Rohit!! Where did this come from? Rohit Sharma has taken a catch that for me qualifies as the grab of the tournament, at least so far. batsman goes back to cut this leg-break, outside edges that flies to right of Rohit at slip. He spots it, not sure what was the reaction time, and plucks it one-handed when it has almost gone past him. Blinder from the Mumbai skipper. batsman c Rohit b bowler 1(5)"
2451,"SIX, he goes and goes big. What helps him the sensible approach - that is to go with the turn. Clubs over cow corner for a maximum"
2452,"out Caught by Parthiv Patel!! Mumbai are running through Delhi. batsman stays back to defend, plays for the extra turn. There is not much, takes the edge and settles into the gloves of the keeper. batsman c Parthiv Patel b bowler 10(10) [6s-1]"
2453,out Caught by Rohit!! Nothing shot from batsman. Goes back to cut a googly that is not short by any stretch of imagination. Gets a thick edge and Rohit Sharma is catching everything tonight. How can he drop something destined to go into his lap!? batsman c Rohit b bowler 0(5)
2454,"1 run, tossed up outside off, driven down towards long-off for a single, brings up another IPL fifty"
2455,"SIX, massive, nicely tossed up on off, batsman gets his left leg out of the way and swings through the line, plenty of height and way into the stands, long-off was a mere spectator"
2456,"SIX, the short straight boundaries has worked against bowler here. He can't believe it - for a moment, long-off thought it was an easy chance, but he kept watching it soar over his head. Coming to the ball, it was another lovely leg-break, batsman was completely done in by it, mistimes it badly and still gets a maximum. Who wants to be a bowler in T20s?"
2457,"SIX, massive, once again the batsman seemed to be done in by the length, but batsman has still managed to send this one way into the stands at wide long-on. On a good length and on the stumps, batsman was backing away on the slog, had to drag it in the end and still gets plenty of bat on it"
2458,"SIX, cracking shot, slower short ball from Anderson, batsman walks across the stumps and pulls it high and over mid-wicket, went a long way into the stands"
2459,"out Caught by Samuels!! Catching practice for Samuels and batsman falls after a fine knock. Relief on the faces of the Daredevils fielders, this was short and on the stumps - asking to be smacked. batsman shuffled inside the line and was looking to help it fine, went off the middle and straight into the pouch of Samuels - at short fine leg. He doesn't drop those, juggles and takes it on the second attempt. batsman walks off to a good ovation. batsman c Samuels b bowler 66(43) [4s-5 6s-4]"
2460,"FOUR, beautifully played! This was a back of a length delivery outside off, batsman waits on it, uses the pace on the ball and dabbed it behind square on the off-side. Backward point dived to his left, short third man to his right - but both can't stop the ball"
2461,"SIX, sheer power from batsman, bowler helped his cause with a long hop, batsman rocks back and flat-bats it back over the bowler, deep into the stands at long-off"
2462,"SIX, another biggie and batsman has deposited this one into the top tier of Kotla. bowler gave this one plenty of air, batsman gets a big stride forward and dismisses it high and over long-on. He's looking extremely dangerous"
2463,"FOUR, batsman gets way with another slice of luck. He came down the track, set himself up for the lap sweep, bowler spotted it and went wider, finds the outside edge and it loops past Pant. Can't do much as a bowler in this format of the game"
2464,"FOUR, full marks for effort from Iyer, but he could not stop the boundary. Length delivery on off, batsman heaved and the inside edge squirted towards fine leg. Iyer ran across from deep square and dived, but the ball won the race"
2465,"out Caught by Mishra!! That's the pace of bowler. batsman is one of the finest pullers in India and still he's undone by the South African's speed. Dug in short and gets a nice lift on this, batsman goes for the pull tad too late, the top-edge pops towards short fine leg and Mishra completes the formalities. Big wicket for DD at this stage of the game. They need few more to take control. batsman c Mishra b bowler 10(6) [4s-1]"
2466,"FOUR, fifty for batsman. The move has paid off. He raises his bat and acknowledges the applause from his team mates. He shouldn't have been on strike for this ball. The basics in cricket I tell you. Low full toss and batsman drills it past mid-off. No stopping that"
2467,"SIX, the ball hits the ad cushions on the full. Slanted across the right-hander, Pandya stands his ground and smokes it over extra cover. Two men in front of square riding the boundary and he split them to perfection"
2468,"FOUR, good finish to the over. Anderson misses the yorker by a couple of inches and that is enough for batsman to tonk it back over him, one bounce and evades the long-on fielder"
2469,"3 runs, dropped! First, Iyer spills one and then takes ages to release the ball. Allowing the duo to scamper back for the third. Short of length and Hardik is hurried on the flat-batted pull, spliced towards mid-off. Iyer rans back and tries to take it over his left shoulder, got both hands but the ball pops out"
2470,"FOUR, lovely batting. Low full toss outside off, not far from the yorker, batsman is deep in the crease, opens the bat face and drives through extra cover. No chance for the sweeper"
2471,"FOUR, this was not the area Hardik was targeting. He was looking to go over extra cover, but the bat turned on impact and the length delivery was sliced over backward point"
2472,"SIX, brings up the 200 and the 50-run stand in style. The cross-seam full delivery, Hardik stays right back in his crease and lifts it over mid-off, the 146kph delivery sailed over the rope"
2473,"SIX, they have recovered from that tidy last over. Back of a length delivery and Hardik short-arm pulls it over deep mid-wicket, the short boundaries taking care of the rest"
2474,"FOUR, that's a poor ball, spoils the over for bowler. Down the leg-side, the cutter gone wrong. batsman helps the pull past the man in the ring at short fine leg"
2475,"SIX, reminds of that night in Mumbai. Flat-batted pull on this back of a length delivery. Does not go high in the air, almost goes flat to the deep mid-wicket fence. So much power behind this one"
2476,"FOUR, now he is playing with the mind of bowler. It's a short ball, gives himself some room and slaps over cover-point"
2477,"SIX, that is not the longest part at Kotla - the area behind square on the on-side. And to make things easy, it is a short ball down the leg-side. batsman waits and thunders the pull well over the fence. batsman is turning it on. Does not take much time to change the entire context"
2478,"FOUR, that's as Caribbean as anything. Clears the left-leg and slaps this length ball over cover"
2479,"FOUR, how far has that gone. Far enough but bounces just inside the ropes. batsman took on the short ball and went for the hook, hitting it high and almost handsome. One bounce over the ropes at deep backwars square leg fence"
2480,"FOUR, batsman is giving it all. Backs away to this fuller ball and slices it past the ring, races to the third man fence"
2481,"leg byes, FOUR, Cummins switches to round the wicket to finish the over. Does not bring about a change in fortunes, drifts down the leg and batsman helps it past the keeper. In fact between the keeper and the man at short fine leg with a whippish pull. That is what I saw, the umpire saw things differently and correctly. Given as leg-byes, must have come off thigh or something else"
2482,"FOUR, shortish ball. Bad ball to start off the over. Might have been warming up. batsman makes full use of it, cuts past the man at backward point"
2483,"FOUR, he is cracking those off the back foot. And the length from bowler is not helping the cause of Delhi. Bit of width, batsman creates some more and cuts it past the man at point"
2484,"no run, direct hit at the striker's end and batsman was gone. But as luck would have it, Cummins missed the target. It was again a short ball and batsman went for the pre-meditated hook, could not get behind the shot and ended up deflecting off the face of the bat toward mid-wicket. Was blinded through the motion and did not spot where the ball went. Heard the call late but was back in time"
2485,"out Stumped!! This was coming. batsman was not quite able to find the fence despite his regular attempts. This time curmudgeonly steps down to go down town. The googly was always going across him. Once he did not meet the pitch of the ball, the doom was waiting. Pant did not do anything silly, collected the ball and whipped the bails. batsman st Pant b bowler 25(22) [4s-3]"
2486,"FOUR, he is not going to budge, this man who beats jetlags. Clears the front leg and hits it flat over mid-off, one bounce and over the ropes"
2487,"FOUR, Lynn is off. Sheer timing fetches him his first boundary. Fuller and just outside off, Lynn drives through the line and the timing take care of the rest. There was a fielder in the deep and he had no chance"
2488,"FOUR, drilled. Aniket pitches it up and is dispatched with disdain. Lynn does not bother to move his feet and hammers the drive past a hapless AB at mid-off"
2489,"SIX, two fours followed by a six, Lynnsanity is back ladies and gentlemen. Nothing but a back of a length delivery and the golf like swing comes to the fore, slapped over the wide long-on fence"
2490,"FOUR, in the air and over short third. batsman shimmies down and bowler pushed it wide, the outside edge flies towards Aniket, who misjudged it slightly by moving in and by the time he tracked back, the ball was over him"
2491,"SIX, he's got hold of that. You bet he has. bowler skids it through from a length on middle, batsman takes a shimmy down and launches it over deep mid-wicket"
2492,"FOUR, shortish outside off, and it's been slapped to the point boundary. What's Mandeep done to himself here? He charged across from sweeper cover and put in the dive. Valiant but futile effort. Looks in some pain. He's fine"
2493,"SIX, that's a six and a half! Into the top tier. bowler floats it up right into the slot outside off, and that's all the swinging room which batsman needs as he sinks on his knees and destroys it over wide long-on"
2494,"out Stumped!! Oh beautifully bowled. That's wonderful deception in flight. He slows it down, gives it some air to lure batsman out of his crease and then gets it to dip and turn past him. batsman runs past the ball. Lovely. Easy stumping for Jadhav. batsman st Kedar Jadhav b bowler 31(28) [4s-1 6s-2]"
2495,"out Caught by Negi!! Another wicket. It's brought a smile on a couple of faces for team. bowler drifts this wide of off, batsman chases it for the drive wanting to smash it through the covers but because it's so wide, he gets it close to the bottom of the bat which spoils his timing. Skews it to short cover. batsman c Negi b bowler 14(16)"
2496,"FOUR, that length is not going to trouble Lynn or for that matter any batsman. Short and on off, Lynn makes a bit of room and cracks it in front of square, raced away to the fence"
2497,"SIX, good use of the feet. bowler floats it up on leg-stump, Lynn dances down and lofts it straight back over bowler. The key was to play it with a straight bat and he did it with utter ease. Almost sent it into the press box"
2498,"FOUR, excellent batting. He is intimidating the bowlers here. bowler is not tossing them up now, Lynn stays on the back foot and thumps it past the diving extra cover fielder"
2499,"SIX, batsman had the better off bowler in the reverse fixture and nothing has changed. Tossed up outside off, batsman goes through the line and the loft travels all the way over long-off"
2500,"SIX, same. bowler keeps flighting them up and batsman keeps sending them into the stands. A clean swing of the bat and the ball sails over the long-off fence. Back-to-back sixes"
2501,"SIX, hat-trick of sixes. bowler is being taken to the cleaners by his mate. A repeat of the previous two shots, bowler needs to change things up, he ends up bowling in batsman's half and the big hit clears long-off with ease"
2502,"FOUR, now this is rubbish. Rank long hop and down leg as well, batsman helps it along the way with a pull over short fine, this is just brilliant batting from the duo"
2503,"FOUR, wow! This is some hitting. Fullish and outside off, batsman nonchalantly lofts it inside out over extra cover, the ball almost carried the distance. One bounce and into the fence"
2504,"FOUR, the runs seem to be coming thick and fast. team want to finish this early so we can start the second game on time. Back of a length and outside off, batsman slaps it past mid-off. Not where he intended but the end result is what matters"
2505,"FOUR, full toss, come on you have to do better than that. batsman stands his ground and heaves it over mid-wicket, no one in the deep to stop that. Can he record the fastest fifty this season?"
2506,"SIX, there's the fastest IPL fifty. Sunil batsman is the proud owner of that record. If someone had told me that he would be the holder of that record, I would be laughing my guts out, but here he is proving almost everyone wrong. Short of length and batsman goes on his toes and lofts it over long-on. That is a very difficult shot to play and even the best of batsman find it hard, but batsman does it with ease. The team dugout are on their feet and GG is leading the applause. For once he has a smile on his face"
2507,"FOUR, fullish and outside off, batsman slices it over the infield. The carnage continues. bowler just doesn't know where to bowl to batsman and he concedes 26 runs in the over"
2508,"SIX, the explosion does not seem to stop. team keep steamrolling. Lynn uses his feet to the flighted delivery and lofts it beautifully over the long-off. Who said he can't play spin?"
2509,"FOUR, short and outside off, Lynn slaps it over the off-side ring. No need to run for those when you keep striking them like that. This is simply brilliant batting from the duo"
2510,"SIX, it is now the highest team total in the powerplay. team have found new ways to create records. bowler keeps tossing them up and Lynn sinks to one knee to slog sweep it into the deep mid-wicket fence"
2511,"out Caught by Kedar Jadhav!! Wicket after the break. It will not matter for team. batsman has done the job he was sent out to do. In fact might have done more than they would have expected. Quick short delivery and batsman takes it on, feathers an edge and Jadhav had to jump up to glove that. Some respite for team from all the madness. batsman c Kedar Jadhav b bowler 54(17) [4s-6 6s-4]"
2512,"1 run, slow on off, Lynn pats it with the turn into the off-side to bring up his half-century. It's come off 21 balls, at a snail's pace"
2513,"out Bowled!! Got him. That's scooted through to shatter the stumps as Lynn lines up a pull. Darted in short, Lynn expects the ball to get up so he can pummel it into the stands. Not quite. team can chew the leftovers of their carcass. batsman b bowler 50(22) [4s-5 6s-4]"
2514,"out Caught by Gambhir!! Oh dear! Back-to-back ducks for batsman, he is OUT first ball in his 100th IPL match. On a good length and a hint of shape back into the left-hander, batsman was looking to work it towards the on-side. Did the ball stop on him, he closed the bat face early, the leading edge popped in the air and Gambhir raced in from cover to gobble it up. Worst possible start for team as batsman walks away. batsman c Gambhir b bowler 0(1)"
2515,"FOUR, nice way to get going, banged in short and just outside off, batsman backs away, comes down the track and slaps it high and behind square on the off-side. Almost went all the way, one bounce and over the ropes"
2516,"FOUR, that ruins the over for bowler, much needed boundary for team. Too short and on batsman's hips, he gets inside the line and helps it on its way. Fine-leg was inside the ring and once it beat him, there was no way it could be stopped"
2517,"1 run, on a good length and angling across the left-hander, batsman was early into the drive once again - ends up dragging it down towards long-on for a single"
2518,"SIX, batsman has a reputation of a clean-hitter, but we haven't seen any of that this season. Picks the right ball this time to play the slog sweep, flighted delivery on off and middle, batsman went through with the shot and gained maximum result"
2519,"FOUR, good shot! Just used the pace of bowler and guided it behind point, opened the bat face at the right moment and bisected the two fielders to perfection"
2520,"2 runs, fifty for batsman. First of the season and he's repaid the faith shown in him. Raises his bat and soakes in the applause from the crowd. Nurdled in front of square leg and races back for the second. The running has been excellent from these two"
2521,"out Caught by U Yadav!! If the rain break didn't bring about a wicket, the strategic break did. batsman does not kick-on. Perishes while trying to up the ante. The off-break from bowler, batsman makes a bit of room, sits down and slog sweeps, made a decent enough connection, at least I thought with the sound when ball made contact with the bat, but it towards deep square leg. Umesh judged the boundary rope to perfection and hung on. batsman c U Yadav b bowler 52(43) [4s-4 6s-1]"
2522,"FOUR, Jadhav is too good with those pick ups. Sees the back of a length delivery around the hip region, Jadhav maintains a strong base and swats it behind square on the leg-side, no chance for deep square leg"
2523,"SIX, finishes the over with a maximum. Walks down the wicket to get close to the pitch of the ball and then hoicks it over the cow corner fence. Gets the crowd going as well. Good day for bowler in the office, 4-0-25-0"
2524,"out Caught by U Yadav!! And Jadhav mistimes one. The trap had been set from bowler. The full wide delivery outside off, Jadhav was up for it, moved across to get close to the swinging range, the loft comes off the toe-end and skies up to long-off. Umesh jogs to his left and takes it comfortably. batsman c U Yadav b bowler 8(9) [4s-1]"
2525,"2 runs, fifty for batsman. It is his maiden IPL fifty for him. Good time to get it. The dugout are up on their feet applauding. Very full delivery outside off, batsman squeezes the drive to long-off and Negi is quick to get back for the second"
2526,"SIX, bowler misses the length and pays the price. Lands it right in the swinging arc and batsman ain't missing out, clears his front leg to get and strikes it cleanly over the long-off fence"
2527,"FOUR, wow! Was that the outfield or the power of batsman? Bit of both I reckon. Too full and outside off, batsman reaches out for the drive and almost jammed it through extra cover. The ball kept going away from the long-off fielder"
2528,"out Caught by Chris Lynn!! Third wicket for Umesh. batsman had no other option than to go for it. The off-pace delivery and batsman went for big hit down the ground, got it right off the base of the bat and sent it a long way into the sky. Lynn from extra cover called for it and made the catch look utterly easy. batsman c Chris Lynn b bowler 5(3) [4s-1]"
2529,"SIX, caught, in the crowd. 109 meters. That's a monster. The slower delivery on a fuller length, batsman shuffled across slightly, bent his front knee and smashed it over long-on. For a second, it seemed to be heading to Cubbon Park, but dropped inside the ground"
2530,"SIX, consecutive sixes. Umesh is dishing out length and batsman is feasting on it. Outside off and batsman set himself up nicely for the loft, slots it over the long-off fence. Flat and all the way"
2531,"SIX, lovely shot, on a good length and on the stumps, batsman makes room, swings through the line and clears mid-on with ease, has enough power to send it soaring over the ropes"
2532,"FOUR, cracking shot, batsman is finally showing the form that made him a possible India selection a couple of seasons ago. Picked up the short ball from Umesh, swiveled across, rolled his wrists over and pulls it behind square on the on-side for a boundary"
2533,"out Lbw!! Piyush can be relieved now, yet another failure for batsman. Superbly bowled by Umesh, this was the back of the hand slower ball, batsman didn't pick it up at all, swung across the line and missed it completely. Rapped on the pads (back thigh) and it's a simple call for the umpire. Umesh exults in delight, team are struggling early once again. batsman lbw b bowler 5(9)"
2534,"FOUR, ends the innings on a high. The slowest of slower balls from Umesh. Took a while getting to batsman, he waited for a long time before pulling it over the square leg umpire. Since there was no pace, the ball didn't travel the distance"
2535,"FOUR, cracking shot, AB gets going, bowler shortened his length as he saw AB's charge. Quick hands does the trick for the Protean superstar, swivels across, rolls his wrists over and pulls it in front of square on the on-side, beats the man getting across from the deep"
2536,"FOUR, classy, that's why he's the best in the business, bowler dropped his length short and wide outside off, AB was shuffling across, adjusts well and slaps it over cover, one bounce and over the ropes"
2537,"out Bowled!! This has been the story of the season for team, says Sanjay Manjrekar on air - can't be wrong. This was tossed up on the stumps, AB was once again shuffling across, as a result - he left his leg-stump exposed, the ball drifted in, went past his attempted sweep and crashed into the leg-stump. A stunned AB has to walk back to the hut. batsman b bowler 10(8) [4s-2]"
2538,"FOUR, lovely shot, leg-stump half-volley from Umesh, batsman shuffles across and whips it in front of square on the on-side. The man in the deep is very square and has no chance"
2539,"FOUR, lovely shot, bowler drops one short and wide of off, batsman waits on it and cuts it late, beats backward point to his right and rolls away to the fence"
2540,"FOUR, swinging into the pads, no real threat, batsman puts it away with a flick of the wrists. No-one at fine leg"
2541,"FOUR, leg-side dross. Smith won't spare. He clips it behind square, so far that the man at deep square couldn't reach"
2542,"FOUR, slower half-volley outside off, Smith gets to the pitch of it and thrashes it away between mid-off and extra cover. Simple"
2543,"FOUR, full toss on legs. batsman helps it to the deep backward square leg fence. Horrible ball, overheard in the comm room"
2544,"FOUR, batsman makes room, gets followed by a short ball but does not flinch. Goes with the pull - tennis-like heave - and sends it to the deep mid-wicket fence on the bounce"
2545,"FOUR, and gets this one fine. Shuffled across to a short ball and tucked in the air, but fine leg was not in the ring. Managed to fetch a four in the end"
2546,"SIX, the captain did not listen to what the keeper had to say a couple of overs ago. Yes, he pitches it up and then sees himself get muscled over the fence, straight down the ground"
2547,"out Caught by Guptill!! Drags the length and gets rewarded. batsman goes for the slog on this flatter ball, fails to generate enough momentum. Finds one of the tallest members on field stationed at deep mid-wicket boundary. batsman c Guptill b bowler 74(39) [4s-8 6s-4]"
2548,"FOUR, steps down does batsman this time. Natarajan wants to out-think him with a slower short ball. Fails. batsman cuts him to the deep point fence"
2549,"SIX, blame the willow, if you are a bowling fan. Or call it a beautiful display of timing, if you support the batters. A gentle chip on this shortish ball where batsman looked deceived for a while. But manages to clear the long-on fence"
2550,"2 runs, that kind of a day it has been for Punjab. Gurkeerat misjudges this mistimed loft from batsman. Goes back, comes forward but is late by then, fails to get underneath the ball despite the dive from long-off. Got fingers to that, so will go down as a drop chance"
2551,"out Caught by Gurkeerat Singh!! Mann is the man for Punjab, finally. Takes one at deep mid-wicket. batsman went for the glory shot, the bat turned in his hand as he attemped the swing on this fuller ball. Skied it high and Mann, who was not having a great day before this catch of course, manages to reverse-cup it. Relieved, that was the look on his face. batsman c Gurkeerat Singh b bowler 39(25) [4s-4 6s-1]"
2552,"out Caught by Saha!! Sandeep is behind what happened earlier in the day and he is trying his best to change things on his own. Short ball that kicked off and beat the pull of batsman, took the top edge en route to the keeper. Two wickets in the over and Punjab might feel resurrected after this. batsman c Saha b bowler 2(2)"
2553,"SIX, had it gone a few inches higher, it would have gone past the reach of earth's gravity. Short ball and batsman gets late on the pull, top edges it over the keeper's head. Goes deep into the stands as well"
2554,"FOUR, bowler don't look at Maxi. Short and slow outside off. batsman cuts past backward point and releases the pressure"
2555,"FOUR, slower ball and batsman lofts over extra cover. No one in the deep and it just about trickles down to the fence. All over. team win by 6 wickets"
2556,"FOUR, trying too much? I guess so. Looks for swing again, there's none. Sat up from a short length, Smith punches sweetly through the covers. Save your legs!"
2557,"FOUR, shortens the length and takes the pace off, Smith had the width to free his arms and he delays the cut shot, that helped him place in the gap on the off-side ring"
2558,"FOUR, looks to tuck a length ball in the air over mid-wicket, gets a thick leading edge which lobs up and rolls towards third man. Sandeep Sharma tried his best, but he ended up parrying the ball into the boundary boards"
2559,"FOUR, too full, Smith bludgeons it back over the bowler's head. There's no stopping that"
2560,"FOUR, right where Smith likes it. Wide of off-stump, he uses his wrist power to smash a drive wide of extra cover. High elbow and all that..."
2561,"1 run, pokes the ball into the off-side to bring up the 50-run opening stand"
2562,"FOUR, they are just feeding to his strengths. Full ball on the pads, Smith picks it up and kills it over mid-wicket"
2563,"1 run. David Miller drops a dolly. It hung in the air for an eternity, Smith cursed himself and almost started walking to the pavilion, but luck seemed to have smiled on him. Smith looks to go straight with a loft, doesn't locate the middle. It goes up in the air towards mid-off, Miller comes in sets himself and looks to take it reverse cupped, it just doesn't stick. Hits him on the side of the palm and drops to the ground"
2564,"SIX, fifty for batsman. batsman gets a fuller ball this time. Something that was missing so far in this over. Clubs it straight over bowler's head. Goes a long way"
2565,"FOUR, nothing seems to be working. Starts with a short ball, batsman camps back and pulls through mid-wicket"
2566,"FOUR, how good a shot that is. Look at the placement. batsman charges on the front foot, sees the length and shapes back, cuts and beats the man at point and then sweeper who ran to his right"
2567,"1 run, batsman drank elixir today! Gets another life. Short ball and he pulls it to long-on, who dives forward but fails to get underneath the ball. Got hands to it so will go down as a chance"
2568,"SIX, just about clears the man at long-on. An almost tossed up ball. batsman goes with the swing and muscles it over the fence"
2569,"out Caught by (sub)Miller!! Finally the catch has been taken. batsman goes for the heave again, was on the move a bit and hence no transfer of weight to impart enough power on the shot. Ends up hitting it low towards the man patrolling the fence at mid-wicket. Was a slower ball and that might have made things a touch different for the youngster. batsman c (sub)Miller b bowler 29(24) [4s-3]"
2570,"SIX, anything up and he decimates it. Fuller ball on the middle and leg. batsman keeps the willow straight and beats a leaping long-on"
2571,"out Caught by Basil Thampi!! This was coming. The approach to the pitch when he came out to bat wasn't that positive. He got a friendly ball on the pads first up, only managed to flick it behind square without power, then mistimed a hat-trick of balls before this one and bowler has got him with a bumper. batsman wasn't expecting this from the pacer. Was looking to come forward, surprised by the bouncer, tries to pull off the back foot, bowler has a man at deep mid-wicket precisely for the top-edge and the man in the deep made no mistake as it came off the outside half of the bat. batsman c Basil Thampi b bowler 2(5)"
2572,"FOUR, full and down the leg-side, Marsh easily glances it past short fine leg, Ishan Kishan runs to his left in the deep and dives but the ball wins the race"
2573,"FOUR, 112kph slower ball, but you can't offer width with both backward point and third man inside the ring. Marsh delays the late cut and guides it nicely between the two fielders"
2574,"1 run, fifty for Hash. The century stand is raised as well. Flighted delivery on the stumps, batsman mistimes the lofted on-drive to long-on. This has been a fine innings from the South African batsman. It's been a good mix of aggressive hits with gentle nudges"
2575,"SIX, this time he connects well. Flighted delivery outside off stump, not as wide as the previous one. batsman goes straight down the ground and clears the fence"
2576,"1 run, slower delivery outside off stump, Marsh pushes it towards point and raises his bat for a fifty. Another sensible innings from the Aussie"
2577,"FOUR, that's Marsh's strength. He is so good with the cut shots. Just can't keep him calm by bowling it wide of off, plants his back foot deep and thumps it away past backward point"
2578,"out Caught by Finch!! High into the night sky and straight into the bucket hands of Finch at long-on. Perfect length from Kulkarni, didn't let Marsh plan his swing, just held it back a touch and ensured he messed up the timing. Marsh lofted it straight, no distance, regulation catch. batsman c Finch b bowler 58(43) [4s-6]"
2579,"SIX, don't worry about this one though. batsman is nailing it off the middle, backs away a touch and fires a full ball over long-on. Got complete hold of it and his bat swing took care of the rest"
2580,"SIX, batsman knows what's coming. A slower delivery, he transfers all his weight onto the back foot and bullies the ball over cow-corner. All power!"
2581,"FOUR, oh batsman! You bewdy! He was shaping up to scoop over the keeper, on seeing the yorker dip he stays still and slaps it off the face over short third, all wrists you know. He might have borrowed VVS' wrists. Seriously! Never seen someone scoring so many runs at ease with pure wristwork"
2582,"FOUR, width on offer, batsman charges himself for another flay, goes deep and carves it away over point"
2583,"FOUR, low full toss, straight at the stumps, batsman lifts it barrel straight, no-one's stopping that!"
2584,"SIX, short and in the swinging arc, batsman loads up and hacks it away over deep mid-wicket"
2585,"SIX, mishit? Who cares? It has gone for a six. Maxi, you beast! What power! He looked to have mistimed this full delivery, went for the loft, but the only thing that could have taken that over the long-on fence is his power"
2586,"FOUR, low full toss and batsman smashes it away over extra cover. Just a hit away now"
2587,"SIX, second hundred this season, mighty Hash has done it on the big stage! Gets a handshake and a hug from his skipper. Cross-seam full delivery wide of off, batsman goes inside-out over extra cover. Crunnnnched off the meat"
2588,"out Lbw!! Some respite, finally. A yorker that tails in a bit around middle and leg, batsman with his back leg deep inside, looking to swing over mid-wicket. Misses due to the dip and is caught plumb in front. Raina walks up to him to congratulate what has been a tremendous ton from one of the modern greats. batsman lbw b bowler 104(60) [4s-8 6s-5]"
2589,"FOUR, that's class for you. The off-side is packed and batsman nonchalantly walks across the stumps, tempts the bowler to bowl at the stumps, bowler delivers a slower ball, batsman had ample time to flick along the ground, made sure he placed it well wide of deep square leg"
2590,"FOUR, this time he clears the off-side field. Slower delivery outside off stump, batsman leans forward, delays his punch and hits it along the ground through cover"
2591,"1 run, dropped. Jaddu it is! Went to his right - not his natural side. Got both hands to it and he's livid with himself for putting it down. Short of a length delivery outside off stump, batsman punches it uppishly, hit very well, backward point flew to his right, there was a dive but the ball popped out"
2592,"FOUR, now that is a top shot! The change of pace, but batsman has great eyes. Picked that from the bowler's hand, delayed his shot, opened up the front leg and used his wrists so well to lift it inside-out over cover"
2593,"SIX, batsman welcomes bowler with a lovely off-driven six. Length delivery just outside off stump, batsman waits and lofts it easily over the top. bowler was surprised how batsman managed to time it so well despite there being no wild swing of the bat"
2594,"FOUR, that is pure wrist power. This was the slower ball, but it went too full, meaning that the batsman had a bit of extra time to react, batsman flicked nicely along the ground through mid-wicket"
2595,"FOUR, and again. As soon as Marsh comes on strike, bowler forgets words like ""flight, air-time, tossing."" MS Dhoni has to be behind the stumps to give him advice when he is under pressure. This is a big outfield and maybe he need not be afraid to toss a ball up. It's flat, quick, short, Marsh pulls it nicely past the deep mid-wicket fielder"
2596,"FOUR, it's a full toss, the idea was there to give the ball a bit more air, but the execution wasn't great. Marsh doesn't try to over-hit the ball, places the flick between long-on and deep mid-wicket"
2597,"FOUR, bowler continues to bowl quick, errs in line once again. Down the leg-side, Marsh glances it fine past the man at 45"
2598,"out Bowled!! This was coming. He wanted to target the offie right from the word go. But bowler a clever operator and out goes the middle pole. The key to this dismissal was once again bowler opting to bowl a flatter trajectory, knowing that the batsman was targetting the on-side boundary. batsman was nowhere close to this ball, a wild swing it was, ended up playing outside the line and made a mess of the stumps. batsman b bowler 1(5)"
2599,"SIX, good shot to end the over which will spoil a good over from bowler. Slightly overpitched, batsman crouches low and launches it downtown over the bowler's head for a maximum"
2600,"no run, a direct-hit would have been curtains for Rohit. Pandya stands tall and punches it straight to cover. Henriques, there, makes a sharp stop and has a shy at the stumps at the bowler's end. Rohit was nowhere in the frame"
2601,"FOUR, this time he gets a boundary! Shortish and wide outside off, batsman throws the kitchen sink, gets a fat outside edge that flies through the gap between backward point and short third man. There is no one to stop that"
2602,"FOUR, wow! Stupendous shot. bowler starts with an 117kph half-volley outside off, batsman spots it like a hawk, waits for it and drills it through the covers. There was a man in the deep, all he could do was watch it go past the boundary rope"
2603,"1 run, wide of off again from bowler, Pandya scythes it in front of square on the off-side. The single brings up the 50-run stand"
2604,"FOUR, this is turning out to be an expensive over. Length ball outside off, batsman doesn't go hard on his drive. Gets it wide of extra cover and the long-off fielder can't cut it off either"
2605,"FOUR, four more, third boundary in this over. Deft touch from the team skipper. Waits for the ball to arrive to him and cheekily opens the bat face at the last instance to guide it well wide of the short third man fielder. The ball dribbles away into the fence"
2606,out Caught by Henriques!! There you go! bowler strikes and breaks the partnership. batsman was never comfortable against Rashid. Doesn't pick the wrong 'un that doesn't spin much and goes for a wild slog sweep. The bat turns at the point of impact and he ends up slicing it high in the air. Henriques at extra cover calls fot it and catches it calmly. batsman c Henriques b bowler 15(24)
2607,"1 run, fifty for batsman Sharma! A captain's knock. Pushes a fuller length delivery down the ground, that evades the fingers of the bowler. The ball hits the stumps and deflects towards long-on"
2608,"FOUR, cheeky and effective. Short ball aimed at the body of batsman. The batsman waited for it, slightly bends backward and periscopes it over the keeper's head for a boundary"
2609,"SIX, highest score for batsman Sharma this season. He spots the slower ball that is on a short of length and smacks it away over deep mid-wicket for a maximum"
2610,"out Bowled!! The slower ball does the trick. It was an off-pace short ball well outside off, batsman is early into his pull shot. He gets an inside edge and it also came off the bottom portion of the bat. Hits his boot and cannons onto the stumps. He could have gone with a stroke through the off-side. Anyway, end of a fine knock. batsman b bowler 67(45) [4s-6 6s-2]"
2611,"FOUR, ah! Boundary to finish the over. Still, just six off it. Attempts the yorker and ends up being a low full toss, batsman backs away and manages to squirt it away behind square on the off-side off the outside part of the bat"
2612,out Caught by Vijay Shankar!! Seam-up full toss that tailed into the right-hander. batsman goes for his favourite shot - the slog over mid-wicket. Goes hard and ends up mistiming it. Finds the man at deep mid-wicket to perfection. Shankar didn't have to move an inch. batsman c Vijay Shankar b bowler 5(9)
2613,"out Caught by Naman Ojha!! Had he let that go it would have been deemded as a wide. Seeing the batsman back away, bowler darts one well outside off from a good length. Sharma has to reach out for it with a stretched arms. In the end, nicks it into the mitts of Naman Ojha who collects it with ease. batsman c Naman Ojha b bowler 5(5) [4s-1]"
2614,"SIX, that's a cracking cut shot from the little man. bowler bowls a 135kph short ball, Parthiv is an excellent player of the cut shot, he deliberately cuts hard with an open face and hits over backward point, it's good enough to go all the way"
2615,"FOUR, now then, now then, how about that for placement? What confidence to play such a shot when he has not even scored a run. Third man was inside the ring, Rana spotted that, as soon as he saw room on the ball, Rana guided it late and split short third man and backward point to perfection"
2616,"FOUR, overpitched from bowler, the over-correction from the bowler, Rana leans forward and plays a lovely off-drive to the left of mid-off"
2617,"out Caught by Bhuvneshwar!! There you go, the pressure telling on the Mumbai batsmen and the youngster succumbs. He wanted to take the attack to the new bowler, in the process, he has played a false shot. This was a short of a length delivery outside off stump, it was never there to be pulled away, had to fetch it, an off-side shot would have been ideal, in the end slices it high in the air - the bat turned in his hands on impact - and only goes as far as mid-off. batsman c Bhuvneshwar b bowler 9(11) [4s-2]"
2618,"2 runs, dropped! Vijay Shankar the culprit. Could have been three down. Short and wide outside off stump, Parthiv cuts, doesn't bother to keep it down, went to backward point, the fielder jumped and got both hands to it, easily catchable but it burst through the hands"
2619,"FOUR, this is a brave hit and well executed too. Flighted delivery wide outside off stump, Parthiv was down on one knee and he had to fetch that shot, extended his arms and slog-swept it nicely into the deep mid-wicket boundary"
2620,"out Caught by Warner!! Look at that fist pump from Davey Warner. Why not! He's taken an excellent catch and Mumbai aren't getting a hang of things here. Kaul gets his second wicket, it was the slower delivery, looked like the knuckle ball, Parthiv flicked uppishly, was beaten by the change of pace, hence couldn't control the shot, the ball wasn't comfortably carrying to the fielder. Warner ran forward and timed his dive to perfection to take a good low catch. batsman c Warner b bowler 23(17) [4s-1 6s-1]"
2621,"FOUR, deft touch from the skipper. Quicker delivery outside off stump, batsman allows the ball to come, opens the face of the bat at the last moment and sends it to the left of short third man"
2622,"FOUR, short and wide outside off stump, batsman delayed the cut shot as the ball came slowly, hit that really hard through cover-point. He wants to make the most of the new ball"
2623,"out Lbw!! And he strikes first ball! What a great asset he has been for Mumbai Indians this season. This is a big, big wicket and a wicket that Mumbai needed badly. batsman was on the back foot expecting some short stuff, wasn't to be. bowler spears in a full one that keeps tailing in to hit batsman on the back pad. Dead in front. batsman was looking to play straight...oh wait! Snicko shows that he seem to have got a faint inside edge on that. batsman lbw b bowler 6(6) [4s-1]"
2624,"FOUR, a full toss now. batsman rides his luck with a dish out of some elegant timing. Executes a short arm jab to whip it in the air through mid-wicket"
2625,"FOUR, and the mid-wicket fence is disturbed again. This time courtesy a standing up pull. Overcompensates the full toss with a pepper and batsman - just what batsman was waiting for. Rides the bounce with a toe-rise and dispatches"
2626,"no run, put down. Oh bowler. Gets the ball to stick on the surface making batsman stand back and check his push. Chips it meekly in the end off a straight batted defence, straight to the bowler. Doesn't quite anticipate the sharp dip on this does Bhajji as he barely stoops low. An out-popper"
2627,"out Caught by Rohit!! Here comes the leading edge. The bowler slower one on this sticky wicket finally consumes a wicket for Mumbai - too late in the day one would reckon. After a few checked defences, batsman looks to pile on the angle coming in off a fullish length as he turns his bat looking to flick it away. A balloon to extra cover, who snatches it from the hands of mid-off. batsman c Rohit b bowler 44(35) [4s-6]"
2628,"FOUR, breaks the shackles. Gets a short one on the ribs and an angry swivelling pull comes out in spanking it into the square leg fence. Hides his pain under some runs"
2629,"leg byes, 1 run, celebrates his selection into the Indian squad with a half-ton. And he's taking his team home. Gets a nothing delivery on the pads and puts it away with a glance to fine leg"
2630,"1 run, keeps up with his leg-liners. This time darting it a lot fuller. Flicked away in front of square. Okay, this is his half-ton. ctrl C + ctrl V the description from a few balls earlier"
2631,"out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! Now go and ice those fingers. bowler keeps up with the slower ones, this time changing the line to one angling outside off. batsman swings his bat through the line, realizes he is way too early and has to settle for a chipped loft. Miscued. Pandya at sweeper cover meanwhile runs in and settles to cause some jitters. batsman c Hardik Pandya b bowler 9(11) [4s-1]"
2632,"FOUR, that's that. A juicy length delivery right in the slot and Shankar swings it over mid-on. Trickling away into the fence with the field brought up. Applies the finishing touches in style. team plant their flag again to reclaim the fortress"
2633,"FOUR, full ball in the slot, batsman feasts on it. Thumps the drive through extra cover with lovely balance, stand and admire stuff!"
2634,"FOUR, eye-pleasing! Back of a length wide of off, batsman gets into to perfect position as he punches the ball on the up through the covers, blazed away..."
2635,"FOUR. The Gabbar is so good with the pull shot. Picks the length early and slots it all along the carpet through mid-wicket, too much to do for deep square, he couldn't get there in time"
2636,"FOUR, that's too much width and can't expect to get away by bowling such fodder. batsman uses bowler's pace to slash it away through backward point"
2637,"SIX, right to the pitch after putting his dancing shoes on, wallops bowler into the long-on stands. Easy!"
2638,"FOUR, smash-me delivery. No real intent on that delivery. It just kept arrowing down the leg-side, batsman helps it to the fine leg fence with a real muscular pull"
2639,"FOUR, width on the off-side to the right hander this time, batsman has no second thoughts, he stays his ground and cuts fiercely square on the off-side"
2640,"FOUR, down on one knee and he goes boom on the sweep. Gets inside the line and picks his gap through backward square, timed well too"
2641,"SIX, isn't to pitch, but boy! Look at that bat swing. The Gabbar seems to be in full flow. Fetches it from outside off and takes bowler for a journey over long-on. The crowd are excited, why not!"
2642,"FOUR, precision at its very best! Call it luck or placement, but batsman and team won't mind. Attempts the reverse sweep and for a fleeting moment he seemed to have mistimed it, but such is the luck, it flies in the gap between short third and backward point"
2643,"FOUR, and that is an usual sight. bowler throws it full outside off, might have swung a bit. But how does it matter, batsman flays the drive uppishly through cover"
2644,"FOUR, back to back now! Another fuller ball and batsman this time lofts the drive, not much of followthrough. Just an extension of elbow and off she goes, one bounce over the ropes at extra cover"
2645,"FOUR, swings a bit outside off. batsman takes that into account, clears the leg and cracks the drive over cover"
2646,"FOUR, Henry might have had a wicket off the first ball this season. But the wicket-keeper and the slip fielder both are undecided. Nobody went for it. Length delivery and batsman goes hard at it, outside edges that flies between the two men behind the stumps"
2647,"FOUR, Henry's pacy puts batsman in tangle once again but there is no one at fine leg. The man is in the ring. batsman was hurried by the bumper and top edged the pull. And because he throws his bat so hard, these edges fly over the ring"
2648,"SIX, boom, there you go. Slightly short outside off, and even though it's turning away, Lynn has the room to smack it over long-on. And then the gymnasium and those arms take over. Give the ball wings. Sails over"
2649,"FOUR, geez, I have jinxed it, haven't I? Has the readymade room made and mows it off the front foot, right between long-on and deep mid-wicket"
2650,"SIX, gosh. Nothing to add. Makes room to a length that has been slightly shortened and Nadals it over long-off. And he says he's not 100 percent.."
2651,"FOUR, the partnership between batsman and M Pandey is now 50+. Mohit caps the over with a poor, poor ball. Overpitches at his normal pace - must have been about 135kmph - and Lynn flays him back over his head. The shot was on. Andcredit to Lynn for reading the change of pace, for Sharma was on the slower side for all the over but this. 37 off the last 3"
2652,"out Caught by Axar!! This is big. What hoodwinked Pandey was the length - full and on leg-stump. Guess he had read the slower ball, for he was waiting with his stance open but the length was such that he couldn't get right under it. So ends up scooping it high in the air. So high that Axar could sprint to his left at deep mid-wicket and station himself into a simple catch. batsman c Axar b bowler 18(23) [4s-1]"
2653,"out batsman Run Out!! 1 run completed. Korbo - yes. Lorbo - just there. Jeetbo - iffy, now. This is a death blow, or feels like it. Lynn had the room made, swats at a back of a length delivery and hacks it to deep mid-wicket. And then coaxes de Grandhomme into a second. Is running back to the danger end. Axar darts a throw back to Saha; he's having that kinda day. He's having a field. On the bounce to Saha, who takes the bails off and Lynn is just short. Wow. Just the wicket team needed. batsman run out (Axar/Saha) 84(52) [4s-8 6s-3]"
2654,"FOUR, slightly slower in the early 130s and batsman has picked him. Slices it square on the off-side and manages to place it wide of the deep point fielder. 29 off the last two"
2655,"out Caught by Maxwell!! Chuck the '13 Reasons Why' on Netflix -- here's one reason why bowler is so good. Pathan takes on the pacer.. like he would a spinner. And pays the penalty. Pathan uses his feet, goes for the big wind-up but this is a slower ball, needed more biceps. Pathan doesn't have it. Holes out to long-on. Perfection. Auction Mohit's knuckles in the next auction, will you? batsman c Maxwell b bowler 2(3)"
2656,"SIX, back of a length delivery, slower again and batsman is out of his crease, weighed on front foot to whack this out. And he does. Over deep mid-wicket. 22 off 8"
2657,"FOUR, there's a long on this time but it has gone too straight. bowler once again teases his luck with a fuller ball. batsman, who was backing away, on-drives this one with a loft. Finds the fence with ease"
2658,"FOUR, slower ball but batsman waits, as if he knew what was coming, and drives uppishly over extra cover. Not off the middle but does the job for him"
2659,"FOUR, the best we have seen so far? Maybe! Is making room to this length ball, the length is just short of a length and hence decides to play a straight-bat punch. Times it well to beat mid-off to his right"
2660,"out Bowled!! Round the wicket slower ball. batsman knows what is coming, waits and decides to swing across the line. Is still early on the shot and misses it completely. The stumps get shattered off this off-cutter. Punjab get a window and the breather they needed desperately. batsman b bowler 18(10) [4s-4]"
2661,"FOUR, bowler throws it wide outside off. batsman keeps his front leg out of the equation and drives to the deep cover fence"
2662,"FOUR, has to wait a bit as the length is a touch shorter. Cuts and finds the gap past a diving extra cover, another four"
2663,"FOUR, only with a man of steel-forearms can do it. Short ball outside off, batsman is committed on the pull but the ball does not quite come with pace. He does not flinch, goes with the pull and fetches it from outside off, almost clears the fence at deep mid-wicket"
2664,"SIX, and now a full toss to cap off the misery. Swings across the line and sends it over the deep square leg fence. Went high and handsome"
2665,"1 run, tossed up ball around off, batsman drives to deep extra cover to bring up his third IPL fifty"
2666,out Caught by Shaun Marsh!! And he is gone. Wrong 'un does the trick. It is a little bemusing to see why did batsman go for the big hit instead of Chris Lynn! The boundaries were not coming for a while now and batsman departs trying to up the ante. Slogs and gets the height on it. Not quite the distance he wanted. Marsh settles under it at deep mid-wicket. batsman c Shaun Marsh b bowler 8(18)
2667,out Caught by Axar!! Axar takes a beauty diving to his right at deep mid-wicket. Googly and batsman goes with the turn. But this is the first ball he is facing. Not sure what was he thinking. Does not quite time it and hits in the air towards the right of the man in the deep. Axar attacks the ball and dives in time to get his fingers underneath the ball. batsman c Axar b bowler 0(1)
2668,"FOUR, first boundary of the evening. A loose ball down leg, batsman moves across slightly and nudges it very fine into the fine leg fence"
2669,"SIX, right in the slot. And batsman goes into the beast mode. Swings, hard and mighty. Muscles it over long-on"
2670,"SIX, more of the freebies. A sitter up on the hips and batsman couldn't be happier in swishing it around the corner. With all the meat in the timing"
2671,"FOUR, the edges too come in. Ah, unfair. bowler bumps it in, gets it at the perfect nagging height and batsman's compulsive pull gets the top edge flying over the keeper. You cannot stop these"
2672,"FOUR, piles it on. With the width not enough to force matters in the off-side, batsman takes it into the other side of the pitch. Another back of a length this from bowler looking to cramp him up for room and responded with a flat bat this time. Barely bothers to keep it down either, gets it in front of the man looking to cut it off at mid-wicket"
2673,"1 run, the off-break. A room creating punch down to long-off. Brings up the 50-run between the duo"
2674,"FOUR, too short. Too wide. Further amplified by batsman backing away violently. Waits on the ball to get close and slaps it through the covers"
2675,"SIX, into the clouds. Too good for the multi-pixel cameras to pick this one from the clouds as well. Too short this from Yadav, all the time for batsman to rock back, inherit the line and plunder it away. Hacked away to clear the deep mid-wicket fence"
2676,"SIX, even longer. batsman turning it on here. A scarred ball this - flat, dragged down and real quick. Just the pace required to go for another muscling swat into the favoured cow corner region"
2677,"out Caught by Woakes!! The greed. Oh it really is. Brings about his downfall. Tossed up wide, floating googly and inviting batsman to take matters into the off-side. And he cannot resist it. Throws his hands out, with a lean and a reach out as he lofts it. Off the toe end and some clean diving at the fence seem to be enough to send him back. batsman c Woakes b bowler 44(25) [4s-1 6s-4]"
2678,"SIX, gets the slog right. Invites him with an airy googly does Kuldeep and batsman throws everything he has into it. Slices it up, slices it high and slices the projectile long enough to take it over long-on"
2679,"wide, out Stumped!! The teaser. And teases batsman back into the pavilion. Keeps up with his wrong 'uns, drifting them wide and slow. batsman obviously with his show of aggression was down and away once again, just that this time even the stretch out to reach the line of the ball turns futile. Robin takes over. The best extra leaked - ever. batsman st Uthappa b bowler 38(33) [4s-2 6s-1]"
2680,out Bowled!! Drags it on. Bends his back does bowler in bumping it in. And it skids on to stay a touch low for the anticipated lined up pull from Swapnil to come out right. Too high in the end and takes the inside edge to light up the night sky with some red again. Punjab falling apart in search of their catapult at the end. batsman b bowler 2(2)
2681,"FOUR, for some reason switches to a half volley. Tewatia, waits, buries and meets it with a full-blooded lofted drive through extra cover"
2682,"FOUR, spots the slower off-cutter. And ensures to dispatch it away. Tries to fox him with the loopy bouncer here does bowler but a walk across to pull it past the man at short fine does the job"
2683,"FOUR, hunts the fence. Much needed this for the Punjabis. Takes it off the pads and brings out the broom as he sweeps it this away"
2684,"FOUR, doesn't get away this time. Seam up delivery from a shortish length, batsman punches it handsomely through the covers. Finds the gap and the ball races away"
2685,"FOUR, cheeky and effective. Uses the slightest of widths outside off and opens his bat face to guide it wide of the keeper into the third man fence"
2686,"FOUR, slower delivery and batsman takes full toll of it. The attemped leg-break ends up right in the slot for batsman. The batsman jogs down and heaves it over mid-wicket for a boundary"
2687,"FOUR, wow! Superb shot. batsman spots the slower delivery well outside off and carves it over point. There is none stopping that"
2688,out Caught by Uthappa!! Umesh Yadav persists with the short ball stuff and that pays dividends for him. Removes the dangerous batsman with a 139kph bouncer on leg. batsman didn't go whole-heartedly against it on his hook shot. He shuffled across a bit and ended up giving a simple catch to Uthappa. It came off the glove. batsman c Uthappa b bowler 25(16) [4s-4]
2689,out Lbw!! A vociferous appeal for lbw and up goes the finger. batsman isn't happy with the decision. The impact outside off maybe? No. batsman got low on one knee to play the sweep shot and missed a straight ball. He is struck adjacent to the off-stump. That's crashing onto the stumps. Good call from the umpire. batsman lbw b bowler 12(16) [4s-1]
2690,"FOUR, ah! Streaky, Marsh won't mind though. Seam-up delivery on a short of length, probably kept a tad low. Marsh wanted to work it through the on-side and gets an inside edge that eludes the leg pole and dribbles away into the fine leg fence"
2691,"FOUR, that's textbook stuff from batsman. Half-volley just outside off, Marsh leans forward and middles the straight-drive. That's Instagrammable"
2692,out Bowled!! batsman is clean bowled. Seam-up delivery from bowler from a goodish length that snakes in a tad. Marsh doesn't account for it and attempts the drive. The ball sneaks in beating his inside edge and cannons onto the stumps. batsman b bowler 11(10) [4s-2]
2693,"FOUR, that's as minimal footwork as you'd get, and the ball has sped to the boundary at the rate of knots. What timing. What a start. Shows you how good a pitch this is as well. Back of a length from Kulkarni, curling away a touch outside off, and batsman just caresses it from the crease through the covers"
2694,"FOUR, full again, but too much width on this occasion and batsman roundhouses it to the cover boundary. Just lashed at the ball and got it away through the ring"
2695,"out Bowled!! He's played on. Big blow for Delhi up front. Short of length from bowler, hits the pitch hard and rushes batsman on the pull. It was there to be put away, the height didn't seem an inconvenience, but I think what unraveled batsman was the skid on the ball. He's late on the shot and under-edges it into the furniture. Middle stump floored. batsman b bowler 10(7) [4s-2]"
2696,"FOUR, first ball and he's away. We've seen that before from batsman this season. Isn't shy to take the bowler on, even as early as his first ball. Picks length quickly, and swats it through mid-wicket off the front foot. Dismissive"
2697,"out batsman Run Out!! Waste, a complete waste. batsman has had a brainfade. He's completely caught up in the LBW call, so much so that he forgets to plonk his bat inside the crease. Excellent comeback from bowler, spearing it full on leg, batsman plays across the line and it appears to hit him on the back leg. Maybe an inside edge, maybe going down leg, whatever it is, it isn't out. Meanwhile, batsman is anxious about the decision, wanders out of the crease and Raina capitalizes from slip. batsman run out (Raina) 4(2) [4s-1]"
2698,"out Samuels Run Out!! Slower ball from bowler, Iyer taps it towards backward point again, a little bit in front of the fielder this time and they decide to go through for the single. Turns out, it's not a good decision after all. The man they are taking on is Ravindra Jadeja, one of the best fielders in this tournament, and if he hits, more often than not his arm will catch you short. Samuels is a yard out. Samuels run out (Jadeja) 1(4)"
2699,"FOUR, flat and wide outside off, Iyer waits for it on the back foot and cuts it behind square on the off-side. Runs away to the fence and that brings up his fifty"
2700,"1 run, another risky run. The running between the wickets hasn't been good all through this innings. Iyer taps a length ball straight to cover and calls his partner through for a quick single. Kishan fires in an underarm throw and misses the target at the striker's end. A direct hit would have been curtains for Corey Anderson"
2701,"FOUR, that should ease his nerves. Slightest of widths outside off and Anderson opens his bat face at the point of impact and punches it through square on the off-side"
2702,"out batsman Run Out!! Third run out of the innings. Once again it's the rocket from Rajkot. Why do you take a chance against him? He is so good there. Coming to the ball, it was a short of length delivery just outside off, Anderson chops the cut to backward point and wanders out of his crease for a non-existent single. He is sent back by his partner. By the time he turns back and tries to return, Jaddu does the thing he often does. Finding the target direct at the striker's end. batsman run out (Jadeja) 6(6) [4s-1]"
2703,"FOUR, Thampi throws it wide outside off, Iyer forces it behind square on the off-side and the ball races away towards the fence. The man in the deep isn't sharp to stop that"
2704,"FOUR, wow! Easily done! batsman gets low on one knee and laps it away into the fine leg fence"
2705,"FOUR, was there bat involved? The ump thinks so. The premeditated shot fetches batsman a boundary. It was fired outside off, batsman reverses his stance and tries to play the reverse sweep. Probably, there was a bit of wood on it. DK can't stop it and there no one else to stop that from reaching the fence"
2706,"out Caught&Bowled!! Carlos batsman has been bounced out by the Mumbai seamer. batsman underestimates the pace of Kulkarni and is late to play the pull shot against this back of a length delivery that kept following him. The ball lobs off the outside part of the bat. The bowler calls for it, moves to his left and takes it with ease. batsman c and b bowler 11(10) [4s-2]"
2707,"FOUR, four to start the over. Iyer backs away, creates room and hammers this length ball from round the wicket through the covers. Thampi, in the deep, dives and makes a mess of it"
2708,"FOUR, four more! Once again, Iyer moves leg-side, opens up the off-side and cuts it fiercely behind square on the off-side"
2709,"FOUR, good shot to open your account. He relied more on power than timing. Clears the front leg and hammers a length ball through extra cover"
2710,"FOUR, wow! DD are still in this game. bowler angles it on a length, Cummins moves slightly leg-side and flat-bats it down the ground"
2711,"FOUR, third boundary in a row. Full ball around off, Iyer waits for the ball and carves it between mid-off and extra cover"
2712,"FOUR, make that four! This is excellent batting. A mini shuffle across from Iyer and is helped by a low full toss on middle and leg. Helped away through backward square leg"
2713,"FOUR, and another one! Kulkarni is feeling the heat. Drifts one on the pads of Iyer. Tickled away fine into the fine leg fence"
2714,"SIX, in the air and out she goes! It was an off-pace delivery wide of off at 129kph, Cummins clears his front leg and launches it into the cow corner fence. It came off the sweet spot"
2715,"SIX, highest IPL score for batsman! For a moment, it looked like he would hole out to long-off. Length ball, Iyer walks down the track and lifts it over long-off. It came off the bottom part of the bat, but had enough wings to clear the rope by a long way"
2716,"FOUR, with mid-off up, you don't bowl full. That's exactly what bowler did and got punished. Iyer drills the drive wide of a diving mid-off fielder. 21 off the over and DD need just 23 with three overs to go"
2717,"out Caught by Dwayne Smith!! Cummins departs looking to play the full shot. It was in the slot for Cummins to slog it over long-on. He cleared his front leg, but unfortunately mistimed the tonk. Straight into the bucket hands of Smith at long-on. batsman c Dwayne Smith b bowler 24(13) [4s-2 6s-1]"
2718,"FOUR, oh Soni! What have you done? Slower ball, was a full toss as well. batsman backs away and throws the kitchen sink. Manages an outside edge, that goes to the left of short third man. Soni, there, initially went to his right and hence couldn't stop that as it spun away from his dive. That could well be the turning point"
2719,"leg byes, 2 runs, a direct hit and Iyer would have been a goner. Very full pacy delivery down leg, Iyer misses the flick, strikes his pad and runs towards fine leg. The throw is decent at the striker's end, but there is no one near the stumps. Iyer gets a couple. Raina is animated as he wanted the bowler to be at the stumps. Had Thampi been there, would've had the chance to run Iyer out. Thampi was just standing and watching - poor!"
2720,"out Bowled!! Gone! This man from Ernakulam is too good at this stage of the innings. Full and tailing in, hint of reverse swing. Iyer walks across in his crease and looks to clip it through the on-side. Gets an inside edge that cannons onto the stumps. batsman b bowler 96(57) [4s-15 6s-2]"
2721,"FOUR, 3 off 3 now! What a shot! Dhoni-esque. Dances down the track and elegantly flicks it through mid-wicket after converting it into a full toss. Wristily played and it raced away off the bat. Jaddu gives up in the deep"
2722,"FOUR, batsman has done it! He was the villain against team early in the tournament, not giving strike to Pant. Not today. With seven needed off four balls, he comes in and hits two boundaries. Cheeky shot. Back of the hand slower ball, was a full toss as well. batsman moved across, waited for a long time and helped it away wide of the keeper. Akshdeep Nath at fine leg, tried his best, but couldn't stop the ball from going past the rope. DD win by 2 wickets"
2723,"2 runs, back of a length just outside off, Iyer pats it to the left of Jadeja at backward point. They go through for a single. Jadeja shies at the stumps and concedes an overthrow. Replays show that Iyer had given up and had Jadeja hit, Iyer would've been gone"
2724,"FOUR, beautifully done. The ball is coming on so well that you need not go hard at it. All timing. Back of a length outside off, Iyer punches it through point with a firm bottom hand"
2725,"FOUR, the bat-face opens as batsman tries to loft a drive over mid-off but he's got enough behind it to skew it over the infield. Gets it away into the extra-cover boundary"
2726,"1 run, poor running once again. There's never a run there but both batsmen just decide to go through on instinct and never take a chance to process their decision. batsman steers this back of length ball with impeccable timing but Raina's dive at backward point parries it to the fielder beside him. A direct-hit would have consumed batsman"
2727,"FOUR, pounces on the width and flashes it up and over backward point. Poor delivery. Iyer up and running with a nice couple of boundaries"
2728,"FOUR, overpitches and Iyer puts him away. It's a juicy delivery on middle, with Thampi perhaps missing a yorker. Nice roll of the wrists from Iyer to flick it through mid-wicket. The man in the deep is too square"
2729,"FOUR, Thampi gets too straight and too full again and he's been whipped away. Iyer not missing out on any freebies he gets. Beats short fine leg to his right"
2730,"SIX, all the way. That's a consequence of going through with his shot. Didn't hold back at all. Fullish around off, batsman has the swinging room he desires and launches into it"
2731,"FOUR, now here's a surprise. bowler bowling in the powerplay. He drops it short and wide first ball and is crashed to the boundary. DD building some good momentum"
2732,"FOUR, treating Smith with utter disdain. That's dismissive. Good length ball, batsman muscles it with a lot of bottom hand over mid-on. Nearly carried all the way"
2733,"FOUR, he's decided that Smith has to go. Really good tactics from batsman. These are gentle medium pace deliveries and he's backing himself to clear the infield. Goes over mid-on again. One bounce and over"
2734,"FOUR, oh shocker. Very short and very wide. With third man up, all batsman has to do is make some connection, especially with him going so hard. Upper-cuts it over short third man"
2735,"1 run, fired in fuller, Iyer prods it away into the point region"
2736,"FOUR, goes down low, reverses his stance and scoops the reverse-sweep over short third man. batsman rattling along. 30 off 13 balls now"
2737,"out Caught by Dwayne Smith!! bowler's done him with lack of pace. Really canny bowling. Cuts his fingers across, the ball holds up on batsman as he tries to loft inside out and ends up slicing it in the air. Smith backpedals at least 10-15 yards from extra-cover, eyes on the ball all the time, and grabs it. batsman c Dwayne Smith b bowler 30(15) [4s-5 6s-1]"
2738,"SIX, that's miscued .. and six. He didn't get that like he wanted at all. A big mow from Iyer, the ball grips and catches him on the outside half of the bat and it goes all the way. Ridiculous. Finch, at long on, is left bemused"
2739,"FOUR, this is what he was trying to do the previous ball. Gets it spot on this time. Waits on the back of length delivery, allows it to pass him and then taps it just beside the keeper to have it racing into the third man boundary"
2740,"FOUR, and again. Such a deft touch. Normal pace from bowler and Iyer utilizes all of it and steers it cheekily. Karthik dives, third man dives, but to no avail"
2741,"FOUR, the outfield here is so quick. Cutter on the pads of batsman and he tucks it past the square leg umpire. The man behind square on the on-side did not have much to cover, yet the ball beat him to the fence"
2742,"FOUR, precision at its best. A normal seam-up delivery around off and batsman drives on the up, opens the face of the bat a bit to place it between cover and point"
2743,"FOUR, top shot! Short of length, batsman rides the bounce and punches it beautifully through extra cover, the fielder at mid-off was a touch too straight and had no chance of stopping that"
2744,"FOUR, not where he intended, but that should relieve some pressure. The cross-seam back of a length delivery delivery, batsman heaves and the inside edge goes behind square on the leg-side, Shami had no chance in the deep"
2745,"FOUR, poor delivery and Anderson pays for it. 9 runs off the first three balls. The off-pace delivery is on the pads, batsman glances it fine and picks up the second boundary of the over"
2746,"SIX, fabulous shot! Just the extension of the arms and off she went. Good length ball just outside off, batsman maintains a good base and lofts it straight back over the bowler's head. All the way"
2747,"FOUR, team picking up the run rate. Six followed by a four. Rubbish from bowler, sprays it down leg, batsman helps it along the way and beats a squarish fine leg"
2748,"leg byes, FOUR, appeal for LBW and umpire Anil Chaudhary has got it spot on. Right off the back boot. Low full toss and batsman wanted to sweep it, missed and the ball runs away off the right boot. The ball had pitched outside leg and hence a good decision from the umpire"
2749,"SIX, just over a leaping Samson. The famous bowler knuckle ball on a shortish length, not sure if batsman spotted it early, went for the pull and the short boundaries helped his cause, over deep square leg for a maximum"
2750,"out Caught by Corey Anderson!! Wicket right after the break and it is Anderson, who has pulled another terrific catch. Full and on the stumps, bit too full for batsman to get underneath that, but he still goes through with it and spoons it towards long-on. The ball was dying in front of an onrushing Anderson, but he gets there with a dive. Takes it inches from the ground. The umpires send it upstairs and it is an easy one for the TV ump. batsman c Corey Anderson b bowler 40(28) [4s-4 6s-1]"
2751,"SIX, fifty for batsman. He's blown hot and cold this season. Still getting used to the new batting position. Almost a similar delivery that got DK out, but batsman was able to get under that and tonk it over the long-on fence"
2752,"FOUR, some charity from bowler. A nice juicy full toss outside off for the new batsman, batsman had ample time to pick his spot and he slices it behind point, away from the deep point fielder"
2753,"FOUR, now the finesse from the Australian. Had the width to play whatever shot he needed, he chooses to back cut it behind square on the off-side, splitting backward point and short third man to perfection"
2754,"FOUR, that is straight in batsman's alley. Full and outside off, and he is too good with the inside out shots, stays leg-side of the ball and goes over the fielder, couple of bounces and into the fence"
2755,"FOUR, wow! What wristwork. He backed away and Cummins follows him, almost cramped for room is batsman, but still manages to whip it wide of long-on. The strong wrists come into play to execute that shot"
2756,"FOUR, bowler's turn for some charity work. Second full toss batsman has got this innings and he has put that away, heaved wide of mid-wicket, got it high on the bat but more importantly had found the gap"
2757,"out Bowled!! bowler makes a mess of the stumps. The off and middle are uprooted completely. But batsman has done his job. A quickfire 69 has set team up for a strong finish. This was a full delivery and had batsman not given himself room, he would have been in a position to put it away, not to be and the ball crashed into the stumps after beating the swinging willow. batsman b bowler 69(39) [4s-6 6s-4]"
2758,"FOUR, shaping in this time. But bowler has gone too full, making things easier for batsman. Whips it past mid-wicket. Timed it beautifully"
2759,"FOUR, streaky, but team will take it. It was a good over from Cummins. Full, fast and slanting into the batsman, batsman heaves across the line and the inside edge eludes a diving Sanju Samson"
2760,"out batsman Run Out!! Is batsman short there at the bowler's end? Yes he is. He was a sloth there, has to pay in the end. Got hurried on the short ball and mistimed the pull to short fine leg. Ishan Kishan wanted the single and set off. batsman reacted late and despite bowler not being in a good position to collect the throw, he could not make it in the end. Did not even attempt the dive there. Might have lost his bat as well. Will confirm soon. batsman run out (Mishra/bowler) 8(8) [4s-1]"
2761,"SIX, finally he gets one where he wanted. Down the leg-side and full, batsman whips over the fine leg fence. Only just clears the fence"
2762,"FOUR, that's his area - behind square on the on-side and bowler is playing into his court by bowling it short. Now that batsman has got the idea of the pace off the pitch, he is picking them well. Pulled this one over the man at fine leg, who is inside the ring"
2763,"FOUR, so lucky batsman is there. Tries to drive a full ball from off and almost chops it on. The ball misses the stumps and rolls to the fine leg boundary"
2764,"FOUR, batsman makes room and gets a short ball to his liking. Cuts over cover, a couple of bounces and into the fence"
2765,"out Bowled!! batsman has been cleaned up. Makes room again but the length is much fuller and laced with pace (146kph). batsman's bat is late to come down on the inside-out drive, loses his stumps. Big wicket in the context of the game. batsman b bowler 6(5) [4s-1]"
2766,"FOUR, races off the bat of batsman. Did not try to hit that hard. Just timing and made sure that he placed it well. Driven on the up past cover, what a way to get off the mark"
2767,"FOUR, bad ball. Down the leg-side, batsman does not have to do much, sweeps it well to the fine leg fence. Was trying a googly there"
2768,"out Caught by Zaheer!! One shot too many for batsman. Another googly but it has a lot of flight. batsman goes for the sweep again and top edges to Zaheer at short fine leg. bowler has struck soon and once he gets a wicket early in the spell he can be lethal, especially on these kind of tracks. batsman c Zaheer b bowler 34(25) [4s-5 6s-1]"
2769,"FOUR, slides down the leg-side. batsman helps it fine off the inside part of the willow. Races to the fence"
2770,"FOUR, what timing from batsman there. Gets on his toes and accomodates the bounce and angle from bowler, tucks through backward square leg"
2771,"SIX, touch short and batsman sees it early. Camps back and dispatches it to the deep mid-wicket fence. 89 metre hit this"
2772,"SIX, and now bowler flights. Overdoes it and gives some room as well. batsman cracks it over the long-off fence. bowler's wrist looked as if he attempted the googly but it went away from batsman there"
2773,"FOUR, swing for Hardik, but it's full and way outside off. batsman leans into the drive and hits it over the man at cover-point, a few bounces and over the ropes"
2774,"FOUR, edged and four, Harbhajan leaped at first slip, might have got a finger-tip on that, but there was no way he was catching it. batsman came down the track to a floaty outswinger, gets a thick edge as he slapped, the edge just about cleared the leaping first slip fielder"
2775,"FOUR, cracking shot, width on offer from Hardik, it was short as well. batsman leans into the free-flowing drive and finds the gap past cover-point, no need to run for those"
2776,"FOUR, nicely played by batsman, hint of width outside off. batsman waits on it, opens the face of the bat and guides it past the slip cordon, no one in the deep and the ball rolls away to the fence"
2777,"FOUR, beautifully played, length delivery on the stumps, batsman gets forward, uses his wrists to good effect and flicks it over mid-on, almost went all the way, bounced just in front of the ropes"
2778,"FOUR, intentional! batsman waits for this seam-up delivery and opens the face of the bat at the last moment to get this one past the keeper to his right, races away"
2779,"out Bowled!! Look at bowler. He is hardly this pumped. Knows he's got the big man. batsman makes room, tries to cut, but the ball is not that short. On top of that it's a seam up ball that skids through and uproots the off-stump. Crowd goes mental. Little window that Mumbai needed, have they got that? We shall see. batsman b bowler 47(21) [4s-2 6s-5]"
2780,"SIX, 'what a way to bring up the fifty,' shouts D Morrison on air. batsman skips down and lofts bowler with the turn over long-on for a maximum"
2781,"FOUR, batsman is deceived for a while, in the flight. But does well to go with the shot and hits it well enough to beat the dive from long-off to his right. Eventually timed it really well"
2782,"SIX, batsman skips a bit, dos not need to dance down. Gets a fullish ball and goes with the swing to dispatch it over the long-on fence. Big hit this one"
2783,"SIX, batsman is justifying the move to send him up the order. How quickly did he read the slower ball from bowler and lofted it over long-off. Goes the distance"
2784,"2 runs, full toss but batsman, in his bid to go too hard on the shot, mistimes it towards long-on. Is still wide of the fielder and fetches him a couple"
2785,"no ball, SIX, these cute Aussie-Kiwi battles. bowler oversteps and then bowls a slower ball, which gets read by batsman. Clears the front leg and sends it soaring over the deep mid-wicket fence"
2786,"out Caught by Parthiv Patel!! A bowler always has the last laugh. One of those things. batsman is gone. bowler gets him, not sure how big that one will be. But at least it's a dot ball and a wicket. Another off-pace ball that is going across batsman. He tries the cross-batted swing, slices it in the air. Parthiv Patel runs forward towards his left. Has to stretch a bit to snaffle this one. batsman c Parthiv Patel b bowler 25(16) [6s-2]"
2787,"FOUR, slower balls lose their venom when banged in short. Like this time. batsman has all the time in the world, waits and pulls to the left of the man at deep square leg"
2788,"FOUR, such awareness from batsman, sees the mid-off is inside the ring, makes room and lofts over him so nonchalantly. A couple of bounces and into the fence"
2789,"SIX, full toss. batsman loves that. Clears the front leg and muscles it over the deep square leg fence"
2790,"no ball, FOUR, lovely shot from batsman, he's looking in good touch already. A no-ball as well as bowler flicked the bails during his delivery stride. Turns out to be a low full-toss, batsman presents a straight bat and punches it back past the non-striker"
2791,"SIX, full toss in batsman's arc and out of the park. Takes his right leg out of the line and sends it over the long-on fence"
2792,"no ball, SIX, that's a big bonus for team, it's a maximum and it's a big no-ball as well. On a good length and just outside off, batsman takes a step forward and carves it high and over cover, went a long way into the stand"
2793,"FOUR, expensive start from bowler, it was the slower ball, but it gave batsman plenty of time to spot it. He makes room and carves it inside out over cover, a couple of bounces and over the ropes"
2794,"FOUR, this is turning out to be a very expensive over from bowler, short and on the stumps, batsman swivels across and pulls it behind square on the on-side, back-to-back boundaries for batsman"
2795,"FOUR, drilled, bowler kept it full and on the stumps, batsman backs away, makes room and drives it through the gap at extra-cover, no need to run for those"
2796,"FOUR, tossed up on the stumps, batsman was setting himself up for the big slog sweep, gets a thick inside edge and beats the fielder at square leg, rolls away to the fence"
2797,"FOUR, lovely, tossed up nicely by Karn, right in the zone for batsman, he clears his left leg and drills it back over the bowler's head, one bounce and over the ropes"
2798,"out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! batsman gets greedy and throws his wicket away! Lovely ball from Karn, slowed down the pace on this leg-break, batsman was setting himself up for the slog sweep, gets a fat top-edge, high and towards long-on. Hardik kept back-pedalling, didn't lose sight over the ball and completes a fine two-handed overhead catch. Much needed wicket for team, the two openers were threatening to take this game away. batsman c Hardik Pandya b bowler 36(18) [4s-5 6s-1]"
2799,"FOUR, cheeky and four, leg-stump half-volley from bowler, batsman bends down low, uses bowler's pace and laps it past the keeper, no need to run for those with fine-leg inside the ring"
2800,"FOUR, nicely played by batsman, back of a length and on the stumps, he waits on it, opens the face of the bat and runs it past the keeper. The pace of bowler does the rest"
2801,"FOUR, this is excellent batting from batsman, bowler went short and wide of off as batsman backed away, he waits on it, uses the pace of the bowler and taps it on its head, splits the gap between backward point and short third man to perfection"
2802,"SIX, lovely shot, tossed up invitingly by Karn, batsman gets a big stride forward and lifts it through the line, long-on is just a spectator"
2803,"SIX, batsman is in a beastly mood tonight, lovely leg-break from Karn, slower and wider outside off, nearly did batsman in with the length. He had to lean forward, goes inside out and carves it over extra-cover, went sailing over the ropes for a maximum"
2804,"SIX, bowler is greeted with a maximum, dropped it short and on the stumps, batsman rocks back and pulls it over square leg, went sailing over the ropes for a maximum"
2805,"SIX, back-to-back sixes for batsman, pushed through flatter and just outside off, batsman gets forward and thumps it flat and hard over mid-wicket, went sailing over the ropes for another maximum"
2806,"SIX, third six of the over, this was tossed up wider of off, batsman gets forward and thumps it high and way over long-on for a maximum"
2807,"FOUR, and Mumbai take off with Punjab's momentum. Gets a delivery nipping onto the pads and tickles it away fine enough to go all the way"
2808,"FOUR, pouncing on the pace. Pouncing on the bounce. 142kays of it and Parthiv throws everything at it as he hacks it. And even a mistime is enough on this carpet to race it away into the fence - the mid-wicket one"
2809,"FOUR, more of the pace offered. This time Parthiv forces it through the line. 142kays again and a front footed smear through the covers. Ah, elegance all over it"
2810,"FOUR, make that three. Parthiv on a carnage. Pitched up further, more of the width and an invite to get back to the business of dispatching these away. Done with another full flowing cover drive"
2811,"FOUR, time for cliches, ""Fortune favours the brave"" chirps Laxman Sivaramakrishnan on air. Also, french cricket from Rana, goes for the almighty pull, the ball shapes in a touch, takes the inside edge and beats a diving Saha, who sprawled to his right. Runs away to the fence in a jiffy"
2812,"3 runs, Comedy. Chaos. Everything happening out there. batsman tucks it away towards mid-wicket and sets off for a second run. The fielder quickly gets to the ball, collects it and fires a throw at the non striker's end. There was an opportunity for a run-out had bowler taken it cleanly. He fumbles and Rana gets back in. They also sneak in an extra run as there was no proper backing up"
2813,"out Caught by Guptill!! Punjab are fighting back into this contest. A big, big wicket in the context of the game. Hold on! They are checking for a possible no-ball but he's fine and batsman has to continue the long walk back to the pavilion. The Mumbai skipper's destiny doesn't last long. Totally fails to connect this flatter delivery and ended up hitting it straight to Guptill at long-on. Too easy for him and he ain't dropping those. Stunned silence in the crowd. batsman c Guptill b bowler 5(7)"
2814,"out Caught by Guptill!! Gone! Another one bites the dust. Rana hasn't been in the best of touch lately and he departs cheaply today. bowler pushed it through quicker, perhaps Rana was hustled for pace. Went back and looked to clear deep mid-wicket but messes up with his timing. Skies it straight to Guptill near the rope and he gobbles it up nicely. batsman c Guptill b bowler 12(12) [4s-2]"
2815,"SIX, Pandya doesn't bother wasting any time. Sees a tossed up delivery in his arc, flexes his muscle and tonks it straight over the bowler's head"
2816,"SIX, batsman joins into the act. Tewatia drifted it wide of off but batsman managed to reach with his long levers and launches it straight down the ground"
2817,"SIX, spoils the over by conceding a six off the last ball. Lands it full in the arc for Pandya, he clears his front leg and smacks it over long-on. The fielder seemed in business for a while but it sailed over his head for a maximum"
2818,"SIX, this has gone some 10 rows back. Such is his power. Full and just outside off, batsman stands motionless and wallops it over long-on. Not off the middle but still soars over the ropes"
2819,"SIX, two in a row. Henry goes short, batsman is upto it in a flash. Spindles back and pulls it behind square. Goes all the way for a maximum"
2820,"SIX, a behemoth, gosh. Third six off the over. Henry bowls it full and outside off, Pandya bends his knee and lofts it handsomely over extra cover. All grace, elegance and class. Go watch a smooth wave caress the shore, this is that"
2821,"SIX, shambles, follows up with a full toss, Pandya ain't sparing those. Gets under it and murders it over long-on"
2822,"out Caught by Saha!! Has that been taken? It has. Up goes the umpire's finger. End of Pandya's cameo. Again bowled it full and outside off, Pandya threw his bat at it, gets an outside edge and flew to Saha. He flung to his right and pulled off a blinder. Is this the spark that can lighten Punjab back into this game? batsman c Saha b bowler 30(13) [6s-4]"
2823,"FOUR, it's a summer sale. batsman is making a joke of these boundaries. Sandeep misses his yorker, serves it up on a fuller length, batsman brings his bottom hand into effect, dumps it straight down the ground"
2824,"SIX, what a shot. If you miss your length, batsman will make you pay. Full and zooming on the stumps, batsman gets underneath it and blasts it over long-on"
2825,"FOUR, another massive over for Mumbai. Again, Sandeep offers a full toss, Karn frees his shoulders and clouts it wide of long-on, Maxi runs to his left and tries to keep the ball back in play but in vain"
2826,"SIX, what a clanger. Maxwell, what have you done? Knuckle ball from Mohit, on a fuller length outside off, Karn tonks it straight down the ground, Maxwell prances to his left from long-off, gets both hands but palms it over the ropes. Clumsy!"
2827,"FOUR, this match ain't over folks. To rub salt into the wounds and other jazz. Mohit goes wider of off, Karn protracts his hands and lifts it over cover-point"
2828,"FOUR, this is getting better and better for Mumbai. Full toss and outside off, Karn throws the kitchen sink and gets an outside edge that runs past short third man"
2829,"out Bowled!! Bowled him. Just when Mumbai keep belting boundaries, Punjab manage to strike back with plucking wickets. Let's call it a nomenclature, Mohit's back-of-the-hand slower ball, aiming at the stumps. Karn swung at it wildy, misses and is castled. Mohit roars in joy. batsman b bowler 19(6) [4s-3 6s-1]"
2830,"SIX, wow. batsman is still keeping Mumbai in the hunt. Pivots back and swats this short ball over deep mid-wicket"
2831,"FOUR, oh my. That's a punch, a ramp and an upper cut all in one. bowler looks to climb onto his neck. A typical Caribbean back footed stride and an open batted punch to race it through the cordon"
2832,"1 run, Mohit seals the deal for his team. Punjab win by 7 runs. Again, fires it in the blockhole, batsman just about gets his bat down and digs it out"
2833,"1 run, has switched to the yorkers. Bang on the sticks. A dance away and down in the same motion to half-drill, half-squeeze it down to mid-off. A direct hit and you never know. Because there isn't one"
2834,"FOUR, a wasted line. Ruins what was well on the course of turning out to be a top over. Down leg and helped along getting it past the man at short fine"
2835,"FOUR, all timing. And glory. Nicely pitched up, very friendly. The reply isn't am afraid. A perfect approach to the pitch of the delivery and a smear to time the pants off it. Through the covers"
2836,"FOUR, okay now a few runs for the luck brigade. Nicely snaking up and a desperate/compulsive pull takes the top edge and flies in no man's land. Over the keeper's head"
2837,"FOUR, pile on the misery. bowler slips, tumbles, falls down and then gets up to see the ball hitting the fence. A slip onto the hips and nurdled away fine enough. Mumbai well on course"
2838,"SIX, another Sharma. Another dispatch. Right in the slot. A shimmy across from batsman to top it up with a full-blooded tonk. Several rows into the long-on stands"
2839,"SIX, he's toying around here. The mind-reader reads the slower one and the fullish length on the stumps. Deals with a backing away and a sinking lofted power over the covers"
2840,"1 run, the time-out almost brings a wicket with it. Smashed down, doesn't bother keeping it down and pops in and out the man at long-off lined up. Ah the dew. And the drop. Mohit Sharma the man"
2841,"SIX, there are some ways to bring up a half-century and there is this way. A gallop down the track, right forward and swings his bat massively to deposit this well into the stands down the ground. His #11 I'm told"
2842,"SIX, and he celebrates with some more. More of the charges down, more of the swings through the line. The zone of having fun here"
2843,"FOUR, oh the cheek. The deft. Attempts the scoop and nails it. Off the middle of the blade, nothing streaky about this one as he guides it past the keeper"
2844,"FOUR, now conventional. But keeps thudding the fence. Forces it full, forces it wide and amplified further with Parthiv backing away and smacking the drice off a knee. Sliced over a leaping Ishant at short third"
2845,"FOUR, short. Down leg. But Parthiv refuses to relent. Keeps the dancing shoes on. Gets inside the line and pulls it away past the lurking short fine. This is murder. Call 100"
2846,"out Caught by Vohra!! That's the end of the fun. Continues moving away, but for a change Mohit learns his bit following him with a pacy length stuff. Gets too big on him as he tries powering it away once again with a loft. Miscues it all ends up and the balloon in the air is taken. Finally. At cover. Something's arrested. batsman c Vohra b bowler 38(23) [4s-7]"
2847,"FOUR, a new man, the same old line down leg and the same old response. Doesn't matter that it is only the first ball he's facing. Whips it away with enough chunk of wood on it to take it behind square"
2848,"out Caught by Guptill!! A bird, a plane. Oh no. That's Martin Guptill. What in every world could only have been a smoke down the ground with batsman in his mood dancing and tonking sucked out by the only man who could have taken this. And he does it with a jump, a one-handed raise and taking it as cleanly as it could. Forget the boundary run-ins and throw outs. This is sheer timing. batsman c Guptill b bowler 59(32) [4s-5 6s-4]"
2849,out Samson Run Out!! Poor running. Absolutely poor. batsman steers it to the left of backward point. The ball goes at a good bounce for Stokes to pick it up and hit the stumps direct. Sanju Samson was nowhere in the frame and Ananthapadmanabhan has his finger up. Sanju Samson walks back disappointed and an end of a good first over. Samson run out (Stokes) 2(4)
2850,"SIX, top-edge and six, too predictable from Shardul, banged in short and well outside off, batsman was swiveling across on the pull - was in no control, the top-edge went high and behind square on the on-side, just has enough to clear Unadkat at deep backward square leg"
2851,"SIX, cracking shot, much better from batsman, length delivery from Shardul, batsman backs away, opens up his arms and lofts it high and into the sight-screen. DD are off and running once again"
2852,"FOUR, lovely shot, width on offer from bowler, batsman backs away and slaps it square on the off-side. Tripathi got across to his left from deep point, puts in the slide and drags the ball back in - but the ball slowly rolls back onto the ropes"
2853,"out Caught by Dhoni!! 101st dismissal for MS and he took it as cool as a cucumber. He's still one of the best keepers in the game - and this catch shows why. This was another slower short ball from bowler, batsman made room outside leg and was looking to flay it through mid-wicket, played the shot a tad too early, got a fat top-edge. For a moment he seemed to be safe, but there was that man. MS ran backwards, kept his eyes on the ball, timed his leap well and completed a one-handed catch - with his right glove. bowler clenches his fists in delight - as much as a keeper's wicket as it was for the bowler there. batsman c Dhoni b bowler 27(21) [4s-1 6s-2]"
2854,"out Stumped!! Dhoni is confident about a stumping. When he's confident, it means he's got his man. Looks like Anderson's foot is in the air, he did well to drag back in, but couldn't get his feet down. OUT is the call. Excellent work from MS, quick hands did the trick, but that was very well bowled by Sundar as well. He slowed down the pace, dragged Anderson forward on the drive and did him in with the turn. Anderson was a long way out of the crease, he did try to drag his foot back in - but comes second best to the Indian keeper. batsman st Dhoni b bowler 3(5)"
2855,"1 run, tossed up on the stumps, nudged away behind square on the on-side, raises his 8th IPL fifty, his first this season"
2856,"2 runs, a direct hit and even Cummins' dive wouldn't have saved him. MS let the ball go and Cummins was sprawling all over the place. Coming to the ball, on a good length and just outside off, eased away backward of square on the off-side"
2857,"SIX, much needed for the Daredevils, length ball on offer from bowler, Cummins backs away and clubs it over mid-wicket, went sailing over the ropes at mid-wicket for a maximum"
2858,"out Bowled!! That's a terrific comeback from the England star all-rounder, he slips in the leg-stump yorker - bowled at pace as well. Cummins was making room for the shot, has to jam his bat down - too late and the leg-pole goes for a walk, first wicket of the night for bowler and Pune continue to chip away. batsman b bowler 11(6) [6s-1]"
2859,"FOUR, lovely shot, width on offer from bowler, Karun arches back, waits on the ball and cuts it late - gets it into the gap behind point and beats the fielder getting across to his left from deep point"
2860,"SIX, cracking shot, back of a length and just outside off, batsman was prodding forward, uses the bottom hand and smashes it high and over long-off, has enough to clear the ropes on the full"
2861,"FOUR, expensive over from bowler, topo short and at his pace it's easy pickings for the batsman. Karun waits on it and pulls it in front of square on the on-side. Long-on has no chance of cutting it off"
2862,"out Caught by Unadkat!! Excellent catch from Unadkat - he seemed to have lost it under the lights, puts in the full-stretch dive and just about holds on. Second wicket for bowler and Pune are finishing strong. It was a length ball from bowler, batsman backed away on the heave, ended up getting a fat top-edge that spiralled in the air and behind Dhoni. Unadkat ran across to his left from short third man, called for the catch, seemed to have misjudged it - but held on with a dive. batsman c Unadkat b bowler 64(45) [4s-9]"
2863,"2 runs, that's a chance and Sundar has dropped it, very similar to that of bowler's catch, this was another top-edge that went high and behind the keeper. Sundar ran across, got to the ball, seemed to have slipped at the last moment and drops it"
2864,"out Caught by Stokes!! That's a superb catch from Stokes - he hasn't just saved a six, but he has got bowler a wicket as well. Watches the ball all the way at the deep mid-wicket boundary, lunges behind, holds onto the overhead catch - realises that he was going over the ropes, chucks the ball back into play, crosses the ropes, comes back in and takes the catch. Coming to the ball, it was a length delivery on the stumps, batsman backed away and swung hard - looked like he had got plenty behind it - only for Stokes to spoil his party. batsman c Stokes b bowler 2(4)"
2865,"out Caught by Dhoni!! Second wicket goes down and Delhi are in trouble early on. Poor shot selection from batsman. Flashes away from the body with no feet movement to a back of a length delivery outside off and gets a thick outside edge through to Dhoni, who won't drop those. bowler has his hands up in joy. batsman c Dhoni b bowler 3(4)"
2866,"FOUR, this is excellent improvisation from batsman. Gets well outside the line and sweeps it over short fine leg for a boundary"
2867,"FOUR, good batting that from batsman. His eyes lit up for the tossed up delivery outside off and a perfect execution of the slog sweep. Finds the cow corner fence on the bounce"
2868,"SIX, phew! That's been nailed for six. Short delivery from round the wicket. batsman rocks on the back foot quicker and dispatches it with a pull over deep square leg fence. Pure power that from batsman"
2869,"FOUR, batsman showing his class now. Sees the width outside off and helps it wide of short third man. With the field inside the circle on the off-side, this shot was always on the cards"
2870,"FOUR, batsman is in the zone today. He is seeing the ball well and has the awareness of the field. Makes room to this short delivery and pulls it well over the infield. The ball bounces just once before crashing into the ad boards"
2871,"FOUR, bowler tries to attack the pads of batsman. He backs away and chips it over mid-wicket. Fielder from deep square leg tries to get across, but fails to stop the ball from rolling over"
2872,"FOUR, batsman gets into the act now. Full and straight, batsman goes through the line and drills it straight down the ground. Smith had no chance of stopping that at mid-on"
2873,"FOUR, nicely done. Thakur slips one down the leg. batsman goes low and helps it down to fine leg. Fine leg was inside the circle and the ball raced away to the fence in no time"
2874,"FOUR, Thakur is struggling with his line. Left-right combination is making it much difficult for him to stick to one line. Now he slips onw down the legs of batsman, who helps it down to fine leg with a flick"
2875,"FOUR, 50-run stand comes up for the duo with a top shot from batsman. Wasn't all that short, batsman quickly jumps on the back foot and cuts it square of the wicket. The fielder in the deep was too square and had no chance of stopping that"
2876,"FOUR, exactly what he could have done with the third ball this over. Short and wide again, batsman gets his back foot across and slaps it past backward point. The ball rockets to the fence"
2877,"FOUR, rank long hop from bowler. Gets what it deserves. batsman rocks on the back foot and pulls it hard along the ground. Splits deep backward square leg and deep mid-wicket to perfection"
2878,"SIX, wrong 'un from bowler and how well did batsman read that. Goes on his knee and slog sweeps it to send it deep into the mid-wicket stands. That's a huge hit"
2879,out Caught by Christian!! batsman tries it again and loses his wicket. He will be disappointed with that after being batting so well for his 36. Tries to get under the ball and slog sweep. Wasn't to be. The ball came right of the toe end for Christian to settle under it wide of long-on. batsman c Christian b bowler 36(22) [4s-4 6s-2]
2880,"out Bowled!! What a ball. Cleans up batsman. Has this man retired, bowler? Wowed I am. Pitches up and swings it in to find the gap between batsman's pad and bat. For all that peach from bowler, batsman too is slightly responsible there. Went for the drive and pushed the defence a bit, leaving the space for the ball to sneak in. What a start for DD! batsman b bowler 0(1)"
2881,"FOUR, this one does not swing. And hence there is no exaggerated shuffle from batsman. Stands his ground and flays the drive through cover. Races away"
2882,"FOUR, batsman shows how to tackle the inswinger from bowler. Steps down and clips with the swing to bisect the field between mid-on and mid-wicket"
2883,"FOUR, slower ball. batsman does not bother getting closer to the ball. All hands from him as he drives through extra cover. Zaheer has his hands on bowler's shoulder. Must be some words of wisdom"
2884,"FOUR, another iffy slog which results in a miscue, but Tiwary gets enough on it this time to drag the ball over wide mid-on and into the boundary. That's precisely why he was targeting this shot. Mid-on is inside the ring, and with a little bit of fortune, he's able to muscle it over him"
2885,"FOUR, that's brilliantly bowled, and bowler is so unlucky here. Having not given anything by way of flight all through the over, he tosses up a googly and dangles it wide of off to reap the pay-off for his pressure. batsman bites, has an almighty swish at it but he is trying to drag the ball into the on-side against the turn, a ball which is very wide in the first place. The edge is found but it zooms over the man at slip"
2886,"FOUR, hoho, fierce! Absolutely fierce from batsman. He's just showed Cummins who's the boss. He gives charge, and accordingly Cummins bangs it in short. But batsman isn't backing down. He thumps the ball wide of long-on into the boundary"
2887,"1 run, that could have been a sensational catch, but Samson cannot cling on! bowler begins with a half-tracker which should have been deposited in the stands, but Tiwary doesn't go through with the pull. He checks his shot, might have stopped on him. It travels low and quick in front of Samson at deep mid-wicket. He runs in full throttle, dives forward nearly plucks it off"
2888,"SIX, he's starting to turn it on now. That's not in the slot, let me tell you. And he hasn't used his feet either. Just plants the front foot down with authority and swings through the line over long-on. Brutal batting"
2889,"FOUR, smart from Tiwary. bowler generally bowls it quicker through the air, so Tiwary smartly stoops across on the back knee, uses the pace and paddles it round the corner. His placement is spot on, splitting the dives from short fine and long leg"
2890,"1 run, dropped by Nair! Oh dear. This, right here, could be game defining, considering how this partnership is starting to flourish. Tiwary wants to take on a cutter from bowler, but the wily old veteran has angled it so wide that Tiwary has to really reach out. The cut on the ball catches a thick top-edge and lobs up to the right of point. Nair never really looked settled under the ball, was still on the move as it came down and makes a mess of it"
2891,"SIX, he has flogged it off his pads for a six over mid-wicket. All muscle from batsman. I don't think he's got that in the middle at all, but it still clears the boundary comfortably"
2892,"out Caught by Corey Anderson!! bowler misses the blockhole and delivers a full toss, batsman advances and converts it into a slightly higher full toss than he would have liked. It takes him by surprise a bit. He swings hard, it hits him high on the bat and he ends up slicing it straight down to long-off. Had he stayed his ground, would have been a much simpler ball to hit. batsman c Corey Anderson b bowler 33(25) [4s-3 6s-2]"
2893,"out batsman Run Out!! That's a very, very rare occurence. MS batsman caught napping is not something which happens very often. It doesn't happen at all. The slower ball deflects off batsman's thigh towards short fine leg, and batsman is just ambling across not expecting Shami to go at his end. Once batsman realizes the danger, he motors through and even puts in a dive, but he's caught short by a few inches or so as Shami rockets the stumps down. Big wicket. batsman run out (Shami) 5(5)"
2894,"out Lbw!! batsman looks surprised by the decision, but that's absolutely dead in front. That's crashing into the middle of middle. Full and straight from bowler, batsman tries to lap it fine but misses and the ball crashes into his pad. Gone! batsman lbw b bowler 3(3)"
2895,"SIX, they needed that. They definitely needed that. A nothing ball from Cummins, gaining no height on the short of length delivery. It sits up for Tiwary and he pulls it away into the stands backward of square"
2896,"SIX, oh boy, do we have something special on tonight?! Back to back sixes. This one is a sizzler over extra-cover. Another poor delivery from Cummins, bowling it full in the slot around off. Tiwary clears his front leg and smokes a stunning drive inside out"
2897,"leg byes, FOUR, away to the boundary, but that's not enough. What irony. The one ball which Cummins has nailed into the blockhole has gone to the ropes. Tiwary is beaten by it, the ball hits his boot, misses leg-stump by a whisker and leaves the keeper wrong-footed. But it's game over with eight needed off one"
2898,out Bowled!! That's it. Bang into middle stump. Cummins seals it and can afford a smile. Those two sixes cranked up the pressure but the young Aussie recovered well. batsman b bowler 60(45) [4s-5 6s-3]
2899,"1 run, we will have to wait to ascertain what happened there? Shreyas Iyer has done a commendable job to save a six. Could not control the momentum and threw the ball away, else he could have come back to catch that one - like Stokes did earlier in the day. Short ball and batsman pulls off the back foot. Looks good to clear the fence but Iyer runs to his right from deep square leg, leaps and parries it back into play"
2900,"FOUR, steps down and almost loses the balance but does well to slap it past point. How often does he do he something like that? Pretty often"
2901,"SIX, tossed up ball and batsman makes full use of that. Skips down and goes with the loft. Never intended to hit that hard, clears the long-off fence with ease"
2902,"FOUR, and now bowler drops it short. batsman uses the depth of the crease and cuts past point"
2903,"out Caught by Pant!! Loud appeal for caught behind from the keeper, given. bowler did not look interested at first but joined later seeing the men from behind yell their throats out. Was a back of a length delivery that went across batsman, who wanted to cut closer to his body. Top edges to the keeper. batsman c Pant b bowler 7(6) [4s-1]"
2904,"FOUR, what a shot. Lets the ball shape away and then goes back to punch through cover. Found the gap with ease"
2905,"FOUR, just a little push but the sound it made was a proof of superb timing. batsman got on the front foot and then beat the man at cover"
2906,"FOUR, too much risk involved for a single. Oh, wait. Shami at fine leg has made sure that batsman is rewarded well for the risk, Tiwary had taken his front foot long way across to fetch the sweep from off and middle. Was lucky to have connected"
2907,"SIX, against the turn and run of play. Leg-spinner and batsman steps down, keeps himself away from the pitch of the ball, swings hard and sends it over cow corner"
2908,"out Lbw!! batsman is dejected. Cannot believe his luck. Was there some edge? It definitely hit him high on leg there. But he was on the back foot having missed this skidder from bowler, who pumps his fist as soon as the umpire acknowledges the lbw appeal. What a wicket. Was there a time-out before this ball? Never mind. batsman lbw b bowler 38(32) [4s-4 6s-1]"
2909,"FOUR, fuller ball on the legs of batsman, who gets the toe-edge while trying to flick. The ball races to the third man fence"
2910,"FOUR, first four of the innings. Beats the five men on the off-side with a cracking cut. The width was there and he pounced on that beating a diving cover-point"
2911,"FOUR, the slip was there for batsman's first ball. But he was taken off for this one and guess what the ball goes right through that gaping hole. Good delivery from bowler, hitting a length and getting bounce, the edge was found but there was no-one to catch and it runs away to the third man fence"
2912,"SIX, picks the slower delivery and deposits the pull over the deep backward square leg fielder. Not that short, but with a half-swivel batsman pulled that meatily and got himself a biggie"
2913,"1 run, 50 for batsman now. Cracked through cover"
2914,"FOUR, mowed from outside off and beats long-on to his right. Knelt down and hit it, not with great timing but good enough to get it in the gap and four more"
2915,out Lbw!! Gone. The Nelson has struck. A fast skidding delivery that rushes past batsman's pull and strikes him bang in front of middle. Too quick for Smith's shot. Easy decision for the umpire. batsman lbw b bowler 54(33) [4s-7 6s-2]
2916,"FOUR, very sloppy from Dhawan. Attacked the ball in trying to prevent the second and gives away two more. Thrashed to him and in running to his left from sweeper, he lets it go through his hands. A slight bobble before the ball came to him, but still should've been stopped"
2917,"out Caught by Naman Ojha!! Two down. The slower delivery and batsman can only slog it high up in the air, a fat top edge, Naman Ojha calls for it and takes it with ease. batsman c Naman Ojha b bowler 61(40) [4s-5 6s-4]"
2918,"out Caught by Dhawan!! What a wicket that is. Two in the over for bowler. A game-changing over? Will only know once the match is done. But certainly team now get a chance to come back into the game. Wasn't a great delivery, off-pace and down leg, but batsman found Dhawan at deep backward square. After taking the catch, he puts a finger to his lip and points to the crowd suggesting to keep quiet. Typical Dhawan. batsman c Dhawan b bowler 2(5)"
2919,"out Caught by Deepak Hooda!! Wow. Wow. Three wickets in quick time and suddenly the score isn't looking that great. High full toss, was meant to be hit for six but batsman mistimed that and looked like it was falling in front of the fielder, but Hooda came in and snaffled that low and diving forward. bowler can't contain his smile. Can't believe his luck either. DK just puts his head down in disappointment, unable to believe the shot he played. batsman c Deepak Hooda b bowler 0(1)"
2920,"out Bowled!! Atrocious batting from batsman. Utterly and truly hopeless. His side have lost three wickets inside two overs and him being so experienced, is expected to bat till the 20th over. But what does he do? Swings across the line, without picking the googly. Past his shot and into the stumps. bowler goes off on his trademark celebration. Some collapse this is. batsman b bowler 2(3)"
2921,"FOUR, smashed. Too full and batsman used his levers to bullet it past the umpire. Who did well to get out of the way"
2922,"FOUR, low full toss and sliding down, helped past backward square leg. Easy delivery to get and batsman doesn't miss out"
2923,"out Bowled!! Cleaned up. Full and straight, with a late tail back in. batsman swings to leg and can't connect. The ball clips the leg stump and bowler punches the air in delight. batsman b bowler 8(10) [4s-1]"
2924,"out Bowled!! Two in two. Before this ball, bowler was talking to Bhuvi as he set the field. Whatever he spoke, he executed to perfection. Inswinger, lands on a length and goes through the bat and pad gap of batsman. Too big a gap and the ball finds its way through to the stumps. bowler ends with a four-fer. What a story he has been this IPL. The whole of Old City in Hyderabad will be tucking into their biriyanis watching this. Certainly made his folks proud. batsman b bowler 0(1)"
2925,"FOUR, awkwardly for Warner and he can't stop it. A high full toss, swung away by batsman, bounces just in front of his body and he can't even get a hand on that. Slips away from his grasp"
2926,"out Bowled!! Brilliant yorker from Kaul. Late swing back in, batsman tried to squeeze it out, but the ball escaped past the bat, may have even kissed it, not too sure about that and then hit the off stump. Too good for a tailender. batsman b bowler 0(6)"
2927,"out Bowled!! Exceptional from bowler. Jadeja is on his haunches at the other end. Looking disappointed. Full and swinging back in, through the attempted whip of Praveen Kumar. Rushed past the bat. I predict a first baller for Munaf too. LBW or bowled. batsman b bowler 1(2)"
2928,"out Bowled!! You don't need to be a genius at this. Anyone can see that batsman has no chance against the swinging and pacy bowler. Especially at the death. batsman doesn't get in line, just stands outside leg and wafts his bat through the line. The late reverse swing takes the leg stump out and sends it out of its groove. That's clinical execution at the death. Perhaps the best exponent with the ball when bowling at the end in the world. batsman b bowler 0(1)"
2929,"SIX, ""he is a puller"" says the great Sanjay M on air. I have to agree with that. Anything near his range and he instinctively goes for the pull, a top edge on this but it went all the way and even if there was a fielder, it was going over his head. On the swivel and then got it away"
2930,"FOUR, four more. Again the pull. Can't bowl into his strengths. Into his range. This short ball sits up for him and he unleashes the Brian Lara-esque one-legged short arm-jabbed pull. Beats short fine to his right and races away"
2931,"FOUR, short and wide outside off, batsman rolled his wrists on the cut and got it down, beats extra cover and gets another boundary"
2932,"FOUR, too full this time from bowler and batsman lofts over mid-off. bowler is bleeding here and Ishan has raced to 31 off 13"
2933,"FOUR, smashed past the stumps at the other end. Too full and batsman has drilled that in a flash. Rocketed away"
2934,"1 run, fired in on the stumps, batsman drives and gets a single to long-on"
2935,"SIX, slightly slower and on the stumps, batsman plays his favorite slog to leg, connects cleanly and it goes all the way over mid-wicket. Can't give him the room to swing his arms"
2936,"FOUR, and now four more. bowler fired that fuller and faster on the stumps, a powerful drive and Warner at mid-off is slightly wide, so can't get there and once he did, didn't dive. Smith is hurting team"
2937,"SIX, given as six. Just landed on the ad-cushions. A top edge on the short-arm jab and Dhawan was running towards it with his left-hand stretched, attempting to catch it. But it went away from him and landed flush on the cushion"
2938,"SIX, maiden fifty for batsman. Raina stands and applauds. Picks the wrong-un and pulls, it was catchable for Nabi at the deep mid-wicket fence, but he was mindful of the ropes behind him, goes reverse-cup and can't catch it. Can't push it back either. bowler doesn't like that effort from his countryman"
2939,"SIX, that is the flattest hit for six. Rocks back and muscles the pull, over mid-wicket, picked the shortish delivery and was onto it in a flash. Sailed into the crowd"
2940,"FOUR, cute little paddle now. The line is down leg and with short fine inside that's not the way to go, batsman gets sufficient bat on that and beats the man inside the ring"
2941,"FOUR, batsman is a monster when he gets going that is. Stands on the crease and butchers this slowish off-cutter that sits up, beats extra cover with ease"
2942,"2 runs, punched to sweeper's left and batsman takes on Vijay to come back for the second. Good running"
2943,"FOUR, everything going team's way. A genuine outside edge and it has flown to the third man fence. Flashed at a length delivery outside off and got a thick edge"
2944,"FOUR, first four of the innings. Beats the five men on the off-side with a cracking cut. The width was there and he pounced on that beating a diving cover-point"

2978,"out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! End of batsman and it is for a duck. Backed away to lift this shortish ball, which was rising, could only loft it straight up and Hardik moved to his left at extra cover to grab the skier. Not the sort of shot to be trying in the first over when the ball is bouncing. But that's how batsman plays. Mid-off left it for Hardik and that was a good pressure catch. batsman c Hardik Pandya b bowler 0(4)"
2979,"FOUR, good shot. Not all that and he latches on to it, rocks back and pulls hard wide of mid-on. Races away"
2980,"FOUR, fine late cut. Waited for the rising back of a length delivery outside off and then played it late, eluded backward point and gave third man no chance"
2981,"FOUR, to the left of third man. This is an edge. Tried to force that through backward point, the ball got big on him and he couldn't control it. But it raced away through the vacant gully region"
2982,"FOUR, now Rohit is angry. Must be at bowler. He brought the third man up and bowler hasn't bowled to his field. A slower delivery outside off, batsman plays it late and directs it in the gap between backward point and short third. That's three fours in the over"
2983,"FOUR, third four in that area between backward point and short third. Delicately steering it in the gap, beating the dive of backward point. Simmons did his best but couldn't stop it. Raced away"
2984,"SIX, pulls and pulls well. With a swivel, picks the slowish short ball and hammers it hard and high into the deep backward square stands. Sheldon Jackson in the dugout loved that"
2985,"out Bowled!! Knocked him over and Gambhir shakes his head. bowler is over the moon. Nipped in off the surface, batsman was late in getting his bat down and the inside edge rattled back on. That turns the game again. batsman b bowler 29(16) [4s-4 6s-1]"
2986,"FOUR, good start after the break. Sliding into the hips, elegantly flicked away, past short fine inside the ring and deep square can't get across. Stylishly put away too"
2987,"1 run, dropped by Suchith! The sub on for someone. A flat pull from Pandey and the sub running forward at deep mid-wicket can't cling on. That could be the game then and there. Wasn't a difficult take too"
2988,"FOUR, cute from batsman. On a length and outside off, batsman opens the face of the bat and runs it down, beats third man. Raced away. bowler isn't happy at all"
2989,out Caught by (sub)J Suchith!! Huge sigh of relief. From Suchith. He flashes a smile. Is happy that he has caught this mistimed pull at deep mid-wicket. bowler angling the short ball into Pandey and cramping the batsman for room. Replays show that he almost dropped this one as well. Just about hung on. batsman c (sub)J Suchith b bowler 33(33) [4s-2]
2990,"FOUR, what is Johnson doing? A regulation stop and he lets it go through his legs. Rohit looks at him in surprise. batsman moved across and helped the low full toss to fine leg's right. What was at best two became four"
2991,out Caught by Rayudu!! Rayudu almost threatened the umpire into raising the finger with his loud shrieks for a caught behind appeal. Poor Nand Kishore had no other option but to agree. But a clear edge on that. So well done. UltraEdge shows nothing though. But the seam changed direction after passing the bat which is an indicator. batsman backed away to squeeze it out and looked like there was a clear deflection. We will never know the truth. batsman c Rayudu b bowler 16(15) [4s-2]
2992,"FOUR, bowler flashes a wry smile. After conceding a boundary. Short into the body, but not that high to cause any trouble, batsman swivels and pulls, beats deep backward square running to his left. So after the wicket maiden, 11 have come off the second over"
2993,"SIX, Lynnsanity has started! Stand and deliver from the Queenslander. Right in the swinging arc for him and he lofts cleanly, high and over long-on"
2994,"SIX, No.2 for batsman. Picks the slower delivery and out comes the big blade, not a big six, but this will do. No-one at cow corner and he finds the fence. Suddenly bowler is under pressure"
2995,"FOUR, and he shows us here that it is not all brawn about him. There is a smart brain to go with it as well. This is down leg and with short fine inside the ring, he whips it over the man's head. 19 off the over and batsman is turning it on"
2996,"FOUR, batsman comes down the track and then plays his favorite lofted hit. Over a leaping extra cover. Just managed to clear the man and that will be good in the powerplay"
2997,"SIX, batsman's balance was shot when he lofted that. His head was falling away to the off-side, but the followthrough of the bat and the timing on that was special. Went all the way over long-on. Just cleared the fence. batsman picked the off-pace delivery well"
2998,"out Caught by Karn Sharma!! You can only see the Aussies and the Kiwis hugging in the IPL. Big wicket and Rohit pumps his fist in joy. A fat top edge on the pull as batsman was hurried by the back of a length delivery, went miles up in the air, looked a tough catch, Karn at short fine though judged it beautifully and took it the conventional way. He didn't go for the reverse cup. bowler did batsman for pace. batsman c Karn Sharma b bowler 21(16) [4s-3 6s-1]"
2999,"FOUR, inhuman this fella is. Really. How hard and flat has he hit that. To a short rising delivery into the body. He just has smashed the leather off the ball and gave deep square no chance. Muscled that with sheer force"
3000,"FOUR, and now gets inside the line of this and helps the pull wide of short fine. Back to back boundaries and what was looking like a good over has been spoiled"
3001,"out Caught by Rohit!! Don't know what to say about this from batsman. I'm speechless. Last ball of the powerplay and he has gifted his wicket away. Didn't try to take advantage early in the over, decides to do off the last ball and pays the price. Backed away to smash it over cover, just horribly mistimed it to extra cover. That's another big blow to team. batsman c Rohit b bowler 2(4)"
3002,"out Caught by (sub)J Suchith!! You don't take on the legend of bowler and hope to get away with it. Not even if you are batsman. What a wicket that is. Could be match winning and a record ending one as well. Look at bowler's reaction - he raises both arms in triumph and lets out a roar. Slightly short and coming in, pulled straight to deep mid-wicket. Lynn didn't get any power behind that. batsman c (sub)J Suchith b bowler 26(14) [4s-3 6s-2]"
3003,"SIX, almost two in two for bowler. First ball for Yusuf and he slogs, without even looking. A big top edge and Mitch Johnson running around at third man tried his best - went with both hands on the leap, but the ball had enough to evade him. bowler can't believe that"
3004,"FOUR, rocks back and tries to pull into the deep mid-wicket stands. But doesn't get that much power, into the gap and a four"
3005,"SIX, look at Pathan chew on his gum. Would've made Sir Viv proud. It was a tossed up leggie on the stumps, Pathan used his long levers to heave that to the deep mid-wicket fence. Then came the swagger with a chat to his partner to accompany it"
3006,"SIX, he has decided to play his shots. No matter what. This is bowled wide of off, but Pathan uses his reach and smashes it flat back over the bowler's head. Consecutive sixes and bowler is left feeling a bit sorry"
3007,out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! The fun doesn't last long for Pathan. Gambhir wears a desolate expression on his face. Pathan was going to play only one way tonight and that's to go after everything. Huge risk associated with that strategy and this match it doesn't come off. Right off the bottom of the bat and an easy take at long-on. team are self-destructing at the Garden. batsman c Hardik Pandya b bowler 20(7) [6s-3]
3008,"FOUR, Tiwary is off and running with a boundary, on a good length and just outside off, Tiwary gets across and punches it on the up, beats the laboured dive from Pathan at cover-point and rolls away to the fence"
3009,"FOUR, easy pickings for Tiwary, can't bowl short and wide - when you have third man inside the ring. Tiwary went hard on the cut, gets a thick top-edge that cleared the inner ring, almost went all the way, bounced just in front of the ropes"
3010,"FOUR, unleashes the anger. In the slot, the juicy length and Tiwary smacks it through the line. Doesn't hold a muscle back in his bat swing as he forehands it over the bowler's head"
3011,"FOUR, brings out the broom. Spots the length, the friendly one and without bothering to read the turn this time sweeps it powerfully through square leg"
3012,"FOUR, delicious width. Gobbled up with glee. Gets the chance to free his arms and uses all of Umesh's pace as he slaps it hard. Over point"
3013,"FOUR, gets another drag down. And the off-cutter. Opens up his front leg, lines up and has all the time to unleash a power through mid-wicket. A much needed fence hit for Mumbai - and batsman. Only his second"
3014,"FOUR, too short. And pays the price. Some pressure off his shoulders with a rock back deep inside the crease and a pull into the cow corner fence. Piercing the gap to perfection"
3015,"FOUR, follows up the muscle display with some elegance. Walks into the line, to the pitch of the delivery and shows the maker's name in tonking it down the ground. Into the fence on the bounce. Brings up his half-ton as well. In the first chance he is given"
3016,"1 run, keeps walking and nurdles it away off the hips down to fine leg"
3017,"FOUR, right off the screws. He's losing his radar here is Umesh, darting it wide and batsman slices it over point"
3018,"SIX, the sound. The crunch. Could only mean one thing. Too shrot, angling in and pulls it off one leg. Into the fence over square leg she flies"
3019,"out Saurabh Tiwary Run Out!! Tiwary and his run-out saga. Slips into this season as well. Just a drop off the toe end on the pull from batsman around the corner and he wants to pinch the single. Tiwary meanwhile takes a couple of steps and freezes. Umesh meanwhile runs, collects the ball and sprints away to the striker's sticks. Tiwary gives up, succumbs and walks back. Not the worst result for Mumbai though. Saurabh Tiwary run out (bowler) 52(43) [4s-9]"
3020,"FOUR, in the middle of all the power here comes the deft touches. Opens up his bat very late and uses up the iota of width in running it through the cordon"
3021,"FOUR, on the up. And a dispatch. the strike rate is back to normalcy now. Stands up on the bounce, shows the full bat face and flays it through extra cover"
3022,"SIX, some way to get to a half-ton. A pitched up freebie on the pads and batsman waits on it to swish across the line. Doesn't even bother keeping it down. Flies into long leg. All very nonchalantly"
3023,"SIX, a mistime. That's what it was. And it is a crowd catch. The brute that this man is. Gets a pounder on a back of a length climbing up much more than batsman would have liked but he doesn't bother adjusting. Mows across the line, gets it high on the bat and it the cow corner fence takes the brunt"
3024,"FOUR, he's into the toying around zone now. Dances down, inherits the ball in his slot and lofts it over the bowler. Effortless. The new bat I tell you"
3025,"SIX, another charge, another bat swing, another boundary. Gets really close this time and has it in him to go straight down again. All in the air this time. All the way this time too"
3026,"out Stumped!! The bait does its bit. batsman stays true to his gallops down the ground, goes mighty with another bat swing. Just that Kuldeep this time has spotted this and has fired this wide. Very wide. In the form of the wrong 'un as well. batsman cannot connect - despite his best attempts to stretch out - and Robbie does the rest. batsman st Uthappa b bowler 63(37) [4s-6 6s-3]"
3027,"out Caught by Y Pathan!! Brings about his end. In the quest of going hard after everything. Another low dipping full toss this and batsman swings, hard abut has to do with just a toe end. Only the height, not the distance. As far as a back-pedalling cover at the edge of the circle. Not quite the assualt from batsman tonight. batsman c Y Pathan b bowler 13(11) [6s-1]"
3028,"out Caught by Narine!! batsman' misery is over, never got going on this spicy pitch. This was pitched up and angled across the right-hander, batsman was looking to go over the top, doesn't get anywhere near the middle of the bat and it's a simple grab for his West Indies teammate - Narine holds onto the dolly at mid-off and team have lost an early wicket. batsman c Narine b bowler 0(5)"
3029,"FOUR, lovely shot, on a good length and just outside off, Tiwary leans forward, drives it on the up and clears Lynn at short extra-cover, no need to run for those"
3030,"leg byes, FOUR, poor ball from Umesh and not the greatest of keeping by Uthappa either, this was full and on batsman's pads, he was looking to flick and missed. Uthappa went down slowly and only manages his fingertips on that, not enough and the ball rolls away to the fence"
3031,"FOUR, cracking shot, length ball on batsman's pads, he leans forward, uses his wrists to good effect and clips it past mid-wicket, beats the fielder and rolls away to the fence"
3032,"FOUR, this is turning out to be an expensive over from Umesh, on a good length and just outside off, Tiwary leans forward, drives it on the up and finds the gap to the left of mid-off, rolls away to the fence in a hurry"
3033,"FOUR, the two men behind square on the on-side are in the ring and hence batsman goes for the sweep. This is what he tried on the first ball as well, this time connects and fetches a four to the deep backward square leg fence"
3034,"FOUR, thick edge! Shortish ball outside off. batsman goes for the cut and gets late, the ball is quick enough to beat the third man fielder, who ran to his right"
3035,"SIX, that envious swing of blade from batsman. Once he picks the length, no ground is big enough. Saw the length ball and clubbed it over the long-on fence"
3036,"FOUR, nicely done. Did not try to overhit it. Let the short ball come to him and swiveled well to beat short fine leg's dive to his left"
3037,"FOUR, goes with the turn does batsman and which is why this slog looks elegant. On top of that, has found the gap too. One bounce and over the ropes at the deep square leg fence"
3038,"leg byes, FOUR, wrong 'un. batsman tries the sweep, without reading the turn on it. The ball turns away to beat the bat, ricochets off the outer part of his torso"
3039,"out Lbw!! That's the curtains for batsman and his affair with the Eden. A brave call this - quite a few doubts on the first impression but boy o boy, ump Ravi has turned around his form from the earlier goof up. A sharp in-cutter from bowler, at nippy pace as well. Jags back in from a length to just about go past the bat searching for the defence and take the front pad. On top of middle shows HawkEye. batsman lbw b bowler 27(21) [4s-4 6s-1]"
3040,"out Caught by Manoj Tiwary!! Disastrous start from team. Dream start for team. A gentle floater first-up from bowler, on a good length and well wide of off, batsman went for the drive, can't keep it down and it's a simple catch for Tiwary - at short extra-cover. Delight amongst the crowd, despair for the team supporters. batsman c Manoj Tiwary b bowler 0(1)"
3041,"FOUR, almost another! On a good length and well wide of off, Marsh was leaning on the drive, the ball held up slightly and hits him high on the bat - went in the air and just wide of Tiwary at extra-cover, beats mid-off and rolls away to the fence"
3042,"FOUR, cracking shot, leg-stump half-volley from Shardul, Marsh waits on it, leans into the on-drive and finds the gap wide of mid-wicket - should get plenty of confidence with that blow"
3043,out Caught by Dhoni!! Very loose. Just not what you'd expect at this stage. Teases him with a wide fuller length delivery does bowler enticing the drive. batsman cannot resist. Throws his hands out and chases it with a drive. Gets a fat outside edge in the process and this time Dhoni doesn't even have to dive. Pune are tired of their celebrations as well. Just smiles around. The 100th dismissal for Dhoni this. batsman c Dhoni b bowler 22(20) [4s-1 6s-1]
3044,"out Caught by Dhoni!! Relay stuff. Executed to perfection. Dhoni adds a few more to his tally. For the first time in this over, bowler goes full and gives Swapnil the opportunity to swing his arms. And he cannot resist. Throws his hands out, toe ends it and Dan, at first slip reverse cups of some sort and the pop out is plucked out by the keeper. Ah, kind. batsman c Dhoni b bowler 10(17)"
3045,"out Caught by Smith!! All too easy. All too familiar. The tried and tested ploy to a tail-ender and for the umpteenth time in history, it pays off. bowler lets out one of the floatiest of leg-breaks tossing it very wide outside the sticks. batsman sinks on a knee, slogs it big time. It grows big on him, takes the outside half of the bat and all it finds is cover. batsman c Smith b bowler 1(5)"
3046,out Caught by Christian!! That's curtains. Mohit doesn't believe in knocking the ball around and playing out his quota of overs. Apparently. Buries down with a stoop looking to slog it out of the park. Done in the flight and the agricultural hoick manages only a miscue off the under edge to tonk high in the air. Only towards extra cover. batsman c Christian b bowler 6(12)
3047,"1 run, edged and dropped, MS is the culprit, went late for the catch, got his fingertips and the ball pops out. This was full and wide of off, batsman went for the drive, played away from his body, gets a thick edge that went right in the middle of the keeper and Christian at first slip. He didn't budge, MS went for it as an afterthought and fumbled"
3048,"SIX, cracking shot, length ball on batsman's pads, he picked up the length and swung through the line, got plenty of height and for a moment - Tripathi at deep square leg was an interested party. But the wind comes into batsman's aid and the ball kept going - clears him by a distance"
3049,"out Caught by Smith!! That's a dolly and Smith has gobbled up his Australian teammate. On a good length and angling across the left-hander, Shardul bowled this one with a scrambled seam. The ball once again looked like it stopped on the batsman - Marsh was committed on the drive, couldn't keep it down, went off the splice of the bat and spoons a simple catch to Smith at mid-off. batsman c Smith b bowler 10(13) [4s-2]"
3050,"FOUR, cracking shot, width on offer from Shardul, Morgan gets on top of the bounce and cracks it square on the off-side, beats the fielder at point and rolls away to the fence"
3051,"out batsman Run Out!! Brilliant work from Unadkat and team have lost their third wicket. Exceptional piece of fielding from the Pune pacer, attacked the ball after Morgan had pushed it in front of mid-on. It was Morgan's call and he comes second best as Unadkat is quick on the ball and makes a direct hit - even as he was sliding onto the ground. batsman run out (Unadkat) 4(4) [4s-1]"
3052,"FOUR, lovely shot, fraction overpitched and wide of off, Tewatia is quick to get forward and creams it into the wide gap at cover-point, no need to run for those and Tewatia is off and running in style"
3053,"out Caught by Unadkat!! Unadkat is having a dream day in the field - follows up the direct hit with an acrobatic catch at short fine leg. team are in doldrums now and the move to promote Tewatia up the order has failed. This was banged in short and on his body, Tewatia was late on the pull, the ball ballooned off the top-edge and lobbed behind the keeper. On another day it could have dropped down in no man's land - but not today. Unadkat moves across to his left, goes with both hands and completes a fine diving catch. batsman c Unadkat b bowler 4(3) [4s-1]"
3054,"out Caught by Rahane!! It is going from bad to worse for team, batsman clips one in the air and finds Rahane to perfection at deep backward square leg. Out for a duck and team have lost half their side now. A nothing ball from Shardul, leg-stump half-volley, batsman got inside the line and clipped it firmly - he didn't bother to keep it down and found Rahane to perfection in the deep. He can't believe it as he trudges off. batsman c Rahane b bowler 0(3)"
3055,"FOUR, edged and four, nearly a fourth wicket for Shardul. This was a floaty delivery outside off, batsman saw the width and went with hard hands on the drive, gets a thick edge that perfectly bisects the keeper and Christain at wide slip"
3056,"SIX, poor ball from bowler, drops one short and on the stumps, batsman rocks back and pulls it high and over mid-wicket, has just enough to clear the ropes on the full"
3057,"out Caught by Dhoni!! team slump into further trouble, bowler strikes in his first over. This was full and wide of off, batsman was lunging forward - he was looking to dab it down towards third man - gets a thick edge, to the right of MS. Dhoni doesn't drop it this time around, dives to his right and clutches it safely. Six wickets down and team are pretty much done and dusted at the moment. batsman c Dhoni b bowler 13(17) [6s-1]"
3058,"FOUR, 'I am not going to change! That's how I play, that's how I will today as well...' Not my words but this shot from batsman suggests that. Steps down and cracks the drive past cover, gave himself a bit of room to help with the flow of the bat"
3059,"SIX, batsman skips down and chips over the wide long-on fence. It is all over! Pune are through, winning by 9 wickets. batsman gets some runs, finally"
3060,"FOUR, although he shows his cards too early, he has managed to get what he wanted. Some card he had. Stepped down and was followed by a short ball that did not have enough pace. Flat-pulled it along the ground to the deep square leg fence"
3061,"FOUR, off the toe of the willow but enough to beat third man to his right. Width on offer outside off and batsman stays his ground before cutting it past the man at backward point"
3062,"FOUR, too straight and with bowler's inward angle it becomes all the more easy. Easily deflected to the fine leg fence, the man in that region is in the ring"
3063,"SIX, bye, bye ball. Margin of error against this man is so less. bowler dares to flight a bit and gets slogged over the deep mid-wicket fence. Well into the crowd with the wind"
3064,"FOUR, shortish. batsman sees early and shapes back to cut, beats the dive from the fielder at cover"
3065,out Bowled!! batsman has to go. Outrageous attempt from him. Got a long way across to help the sweep over the infield on the on-side. Missed it completely and the ball crashed the bails. batsman b bowler 28(20) [4s-4 6s-1]
3066,"1 run, batsman slogs and is in danger there. Guptill has it covered with a reverse cup at deep mid-wicket. Hold on, he is not having a good day and so, he drops it"
3067,out Caught by Kohli!! Wicket of the second ball for bowler. Another short of length delivery that cramps batsman for room. He tries to take him on with a pull. The ball gets big on him and he splices it straight to mid-on. Kohli takes a dolly. batsman c Kohli b bowler 0(2)
3068,"FOUR, top shot from batsman. Gets outside the line and sweeps controls the sweep wide of short fine leg for a boundary. The first one of the DD innings"
3069,"byes, FOUR, what happened there? batsman was loose with his shot. Drives away from the body and the ball spun a mile to beat the outside edge. Keeper too fails to glove that"
3070,"FOUR, short of a good length ball on the middle and leg. batsman pulls well behind square on the on-side. Races away to the fence"
3071,"out Caught by Watson!! The plan has worked. The plan to bowl short and slow to these two. Once again batsman fails to get the timing right. Backs away a touch to slap past cover. That's actually not a bad shot, but ends up hitting it straight to the fielder at extra cover. So straight that the man there did not have to move an inch. batsman c Watson b bowler 32(30) [4s-2 6s-1]"
3072,"out Bowled!! Back to back wickets for bowler. What did batsman do there? Perhaps was not expecting the slower ball first up. But gets one, is committed on the defence and by the time tries to adjust by slightly taking the bottom hand of the handle, it is late. Crashes the off-stump. If Bangalore were looking for a window to seal things, this is the one. AAAR CEE BEE is back here. Hat-trick ball coming up. batsman b bowler 0(1)"
3073,"FOUR, such a sweet, sensible shot from the young man. Sees the short ball, that is slow too. Waits, dabs between short third man and backward point"
3074,out Stumped!! This is reckless from batsman. Just treks down to heave it across. Has no clue about where it has pitched. The ball scoots under his bat and the keeper does not have buttery gloves.. so that is the end of Anderson's IPL this year. batsman st Vishnu Vinod b bowler 3(9)
3075,"SIX, floated slightly and batsman slogs across the line. Connects well and sends over the deep mid-wicket fence"
3076,out Caught by Kohli!! That is a case of not realizing the importance of the wicket and attempting to send everything out of the park. Is a flighted delivery outside off and batsman tries to loft over long-off. Gets off the bottom part of the bat and the team captain does not have to move much at the fence. batsman c Kohli b bowler 7(3) [6s-1]
3077,"SIX, he is running out of partners but that does not bother him. Finally a delivery that is 141kph and on a length. batsman gets across slightly to cover the angle as it was bowled round the wicket. Whips the pull over the square leg fence"
3078,"out Bowled!! bowler has got the wicket that might just seal things for team tonight. The crowd goes mum. Slower ball on off, batsman launches into the heave. Swings the bat too early and the ball scoots under to uproot the off-stump. bowler roars and alongside him roar the millions of team fans who finally have a reason to celebrate. batsman b bowler 45(34) [4s-3 6s-2]"
3079,"FOUR, not a bad shot to get off the mark. Moves across to this short ball and helps the pull to the fine leg fence"
3080,"FOUR, full around off. batsman has nothing to lose, no tailender has! Crunches the drive to the deep extra cover fence"
3081,"SIX, he won Delhi the last game by cracking back to back fours. Steps down this time and lofts with a straight bat to clear the long-on fence"
3082,"out Bowled!! batsman won't do it for Delhi tonight. Cannot resist his tailender skills and attempts one shot too many. Steps down and makes room, only a littl though, and misses the lofted drive and the ball clatters his stumps. batsman b bowler 7(4) [6s-1]"
3083,"SIX, batsman has not given up, not just yet. A pitched up ball around off, clears the front leg and and cracks hard. Kohli at long-on gets fingertips to that. Not good enough to parry it back. bowler is down again. But wants to continue after having a word with the skipper"
3084,"FOUR, 13 they will need off the last over, DD. Another short ball and batsman slices the pull over the keeper's head. A couple of bounces and into the fence"
3085,"out Stumped!! Stumping appeal, this looks close. Has he stepped out? Front foot is fine. His back foot is out but has he got it back in time? Zoomer comes in. Looks out to me, not sure about the man upstairs. He wants to check all the angles. Might just be in the air. Out that is and the roar tells me Kotla has shifted to Bangalore. batsman wanted to swing this one out of the park after stepping down, bowler's darter was too good to be meted with that kind of a treatment. batsman st Vishnu Vinod b bowler 21(9) [4s-3 6s-1][/b]"
3086,out Caught by Kedar Jadhav!! Slogs across the line and finds the man at deep square leg. Bangalore end their 2017 IPL campaign with a 10-run win. batsman c Kedar Jadhav b bowler 2(6)
3087,"FOUR, that a top shot from batsman. Stands tall and admires the punch through covers. The fielder had no chance of stopping those. 6runs off 2overs from bowler"
3088,"SIX, bowler gives it little more air this time. batsman jumps out of his crease quickly and thumbs it over long-on for a maximum. First one of the innings"
3089,"FOUR, poor start from bowler. With third man and point inside the circle, he gives batsman the room outside off. batsman waits for the ball and cuts it late to pick the gap perfectly"
3090,"FOUR, cheeky from batsman. Walks inside the line of the ball and scoops it over short fine leg for his second boundary of the over"
3091,"FOUR, back-to-back boundaries for batsman. It was short and wide outside off, batsman gets in position early and slaps it past point. The ball races away to the fence"
3092,out Caught by Kedar Jadhav!! batsman perishes. One shot too many. Shane bowler digs it in short. The ball didn't get up as much as he wanted it to. Hurries onto batsman's pull and all he manages to do is to miscue it to mid-wicket. An easy catch for Kedar Jadhav. batsman c Kedar Jadhav b bowler 26(22) [4s-5]
3093,"FOUR, this time batsman splits the gap in the deep perfectly. Thumps it towards cow corner and the ball bounces a couple of times before hitting the ad boards"
3094,"SIX, batsman gets into the act now. Goes inside out over cover. Gets a good connection and the ball has enough legs to sail over the leaping long-off fielder for a maximum"
3095,"FOUR, batsman makes full use of the free-hit. A quicker delivery on the pads, batsman flicks it wide of short fine leg for a boundary"
3096,"FOUR, batsman is off and running, no hat-trick of ducks for the big man. Too straight from bowler, ends up drifting onto batsman's pads, he gets inside the line and helps it on its way, beats short fine leg and rolls away to the fence"
3097,"FOUR, lovely shot, overpitched and on batsman's pads, that's easy pickings for him, gets inside the line and clips it in front of square on the on-side, beats the fielder getting across from the deep"
3098,"SIX, batsman will play freely tonight, this was full and wide of off, batsman threw the kitchen sink at that, gets a thick outside edge that went high and over third man, first six of the night"
3099,"SIX, a batsman special. bowler darts the quicker front of the hand stuff. And he darts it half way down the pitch as well. All the time for batsman to rock back and swat him away. High and mighty"
3100,"SIX, more of the juicy bowlerji half-trackers. More of the dispatches. This time it is off batsman. Stays behind with the weight going backwards and a short arm jab in the air. Into his favoured cow corner region"
3101,"FOUR, the dart again. But this time batsman takes matters all along the turf. Making it look all the more elegant. Clears his front leg and whips it powerfully through mid-on"
3102,"out Caught by Zaheer!! Yes, the break does its job. The leg-spinner from bowler, spinning the other way and batsman's committed slog-sweep has him holing out. The air on this one makes him lose his timing as well with the ball only managing the toe-end as he swings it down the throat of mid-wicket. Delhi needed this big time, pouching batsman just when he was about to explode. batsman c Zaheer b bowler 48(38) [4s-3 6s-3]"
3103,out Head Run Out!! 1 run completed. Matters taken upstairs. Some confusion while wanting the second run and Head sacrifices his head for his skipper. Is forced to run back and even a wide throw gives bowler enough time to grab and catch him short. team lose another. Was a walking flick through mid-wicket and batsman always wanted the second. The only problem - there never was two there. Head bears the brunt. Head run out (Shreyas Iyer/bowler) 2(2)
3104,"1 run, here's the half-ton. Kotla acknowledges. A leaning drive off an opened bat face through sweeper gets him there. The fourth of the season"
3105,"no run, just doesn't stick. Zak has to give himself the stare here. Lets off the big man after inducing him into a false stroke. Misreads the slower one here does batsman and is way early into a whack. Chips it back to the bowler, who in his followthrough gets both palms to it. Just doesn't stick"
3106,"SIX, a clear case of a missed yorker. Ends up becoming a juicy full toss and batsman stands and swishes across the line. Several rows into his favoured mid-wicket stands"
3107,"out Caught by Nadeem!! Holes out before the final finish as well. That's the end with the bat for batsman this season. After a favour of a full toss from Zak, he decides to return the favour. Another slower one on the driving length and the lofted drive through the off-side has the bat turning in his palms as he balloons it to long-off. batsman is angry, no he is furious. Takes out the anger on himself slapping his legs with his bat. batsman c Nadeem b bowler 58(45) [4s-3 6s-3]"
3108,"SIX, Jadhav joins the act. Gets one right in the slot and he isn't in a mood to spare these. Swings his bat down and plunders it down the ground. A crowd catch"
3109,"out batsman Run Out!! Freaky. Oh absolutely. When bowler doesn't get a wicket off a pin-point accurate yorker, the Gods align themselves to get a run-out. Right on the base of middle and Jadhav just about digs it away somehow to short third man. Cummins out there, gathers and catches Jadhav in a lazy mood to finish the run. Has a shy at the bowler's end and bowler mid-way gets his hands out of the way. Not before giving it a faint tickle and directing it onto the stumps. batsman run out (Pat Cummins) 12(9) [6s-1]"
3110,"FOUR, misses the length. Dishes out a full toss and Baby piles on. Ensures that he bisects the two men in the off-side at the fence and gets it wide enough with his murderous drive"
3111,"FOUR, intercepting the gap. Again. Dead straight with his drills down the ground. Banging it into the turf and it flies over the umpire and teases the two men converging. To beat them both"
3112,"out Caught by Corey Anderson!! A miscue. Plucked just inside the ropes. Gets a length delivery and unleashes a violent swing of the blade. Slices it high but not beyond the reach of Corey, who positions himself right at the edge of the ropes at long-on, and collects it without breaking into a sweat. Reverse cupped too. Talk of swagger. batsman c Corey Anderson b bowler 12(8) [4s-2]"
3113,"FOUR, width. Throws his hands out. Without holding anything back in the process. Skews off the outside half of the blade in the process. Not bad with third man inside the circle"
3114,"FOUR, he does it again. Pierces the gap between the keeper and short third. Again with the outside edge. Crashes a bat throw at a wide delivery, just doesn't reach out fully but meaty enough with the outside carve flying away"
3115,"FOUR, follows the edges with one off the meat. A half volley and sends it on a leather hunt with a spank through the covers. Bangalore touch 160"
3116,"SIX, massive, too short from bowler and batsman often doesn't let them go unpunished. This was the slower short ball from bowler, batsman spotted it early, stayed back and pulled it over mid-wicket, went a long way into the stands"
3117,"out Bowled!! Cummins has made a mess of Vinod's stumps. This was pitched on a good length and held its line outside off, Vinod was in no position on the pull - went through with the shot and looked real ugly on replays, gets an inside edge and the ball clatters into the middle-stump. team have lost an early wicket once again. batsman b bowler 3(9)"
3118,"FOUR, cracking shot, attempted yorker from bowler turns out into a low full-toss. batsman presents the full face of the bat and punches it back past the non-striker, beats mid-on and rolls away to the fence"
3119,"FOUR, cracking shot, flatter and on the stumps, batsman rocks back and pulls it wide of long-on, the fielder gets across, puts in the slide and can't haul the ball back in"
3120,"SIX, lovely shot, a simple extension of his arms and batsman has sent it sailing over extra-cover. One of the shots of the tourney, on a good length and just outside off, batsman leans forward, plays a check-push and sends the ball soaring over the infield"
3121,"FOUR, nicely played, bowler drifts this one on batsman's pads, he gets inside the line and helps it fine, beats Mishra at short fine and rolls away to the fence"
3122,"SIX, there's a man at deep square, but he is just left ball-watching. Floated up into the pads, PP uses those lovely wrists to send the flick aerial over square leg. Sheer timing. Nothing else"
3123,"out Caught by Christian!! Look at bowler chuckle. He thinks it's too easy. Goes wide of the crease and angles a ball in, enticing batsman into a punch. And one he plays, just that he does it uppishly, and early, with this 139ks ball sticking in the pitch. Straight to long-on, who reverse-cups it. And now you know why bowler was smiling. batsman c Christian b bowler 14(10) [4s-1 6s-1]"
3124,"out Caught by Unadkat!! Cutting away, this slower full ball, and lobs off the cue-end to short third man. batsman wanted to go big downtown but hey, this is Mumbai, with its pace all sold off to neighbouring pitches, you feel. batsman c Unadkat b bowler 12(11) [6s-1]"
3125,"SIX, PP starting from where he left off. Short ball, angled into the body, his head stays still as he pulls this handsomely into the crowd. Sight to watch"
3126,"SIX, Dhoni carves a final spot for Pune in IPL 2017. What a 'Sundar' performance. It means beautiful in Hindi.. Anyway, assuming you have let that pass, let's get back to cricket: batsman finishes by swatting a six over deep mid-wicket, where the fielder almost has it but then dives over the ropes. Nothing matters. Cricket doesn't allow 27 runs to be scored off one ball. Sane cricket, so to say"
3127,"SIX, the pocket rocket of Mumbai Indians is trying to squeeze maximum off the powerplay. No hanging back. Swivels into a perfect position as he pulls a leg-side filth flat into the stands"
3128,"FOUR, the pitch is slow? What are you talking! PP evokes those emotions now. He chips a gorgeous drive over extra cover"
3129,"out Simmons Run Out!! Oh, unlucky! Knuckle ball straight at the stumps, PP hits it back the bowler who manages to get some finger after stretching his right hand, it bounces and knocks the bails before crashing into the stumps. Simmons was backing up too far and was caught napping. Wasn't even in the frame. Simmons run out (bowler) 5(13)"
3130,"FOUR, PP continues on his merry ways"
3131,"out Lbw!! Ah! batsman Sharma and his struggles against spinners this season. Oh wait! There seems to have a big inside edge. Yes there is. Gets down low to sweep bowler past square leg, edged and onto the pads. Looked close to the naked eye, just that the umpire didn't pick the edge. batsman Sharma walks back disappointed. batsman lbw b bowler 1(2)"
3132,"out Caught by Smith!! Gone without scoring. No heroics from batsman tonight. He takes on a short ball, but doesn't get his timing right on the pull, hits the top-half and Smithy takes a sharp catch diving forward at short mid-wicket. batsman c Smith b bowler 0(3)"
3133,"FOUR, driven past the diving mid-off this time. The key is he didn't force the shot, just allowed his instincts to take over, full and wide, all he needed was to locate the middle of the willow. Tiiiiimed!"
3134,"out Caught by Smith!! That's a poor shot, real horror of a shot. Very very lazy from KP. Steve Smith Stationed himself at short mid-wicket lurking for an opportunity, he was waiting for that brain-fade moment from the big man. And it didn't take long. A languid flick, no real intent on the shot, just playing it in more of hope. It went flat and low to the right of Smudge who had it covered with his bucket hands. batsman c Smith b bowler 7(10) [4s-1]"
3135,"FOUR, latches on the width on offer and flays it away past backward point, a real thrashing that"
3136,"FOUR, short and slipping down leg, batsman helps it to the fine leg boundary boards with a perfect swivel pull"
3137,"SIX, that's the way he plays. Swagger. Saw the revs and lined himself up for the biggie, clean connection and bam it goes over long-off"
3138,"out Bowled!! The full swinging in delivery does the trick. That was pitched up and the batsman trying to play across the line of the ball, misses and is cleaned up. batsman is gone for a blob and Mumbai have jolted team early. bowler takes off as his joy knows no bounds. batsman b bowler 0(2)"
3139,out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! bowler strikes now. batsman c Hardik Pandya b bowler 1(2)
3140,"FOUR, short and wide outside off, batsman latches onto it. The Mumbaikar hangs back and cuts it fiercely to the left of a diving backward point fielder. The ball raced away"
3141,"FOUR, in the air and in the gap. Tiwary gets down on one knee and plays against the turn. His slog sweep finds the gap between long-on and deep mid-wicket. One bounce and into the fence"
3142,"FOUR, ah! That should have been a single. A fierceful - let's make words! - sweep shot from batsman that goes through square leg. The Big Mitch in the deep can't stop it as the ball spin away from him. He didn't anticipate that and wen the wrong way"
3143,"1 run, another sweep shot through mid-wicket. The single brings up batsman's fifty. He should up the ante now"
3144,"out Lbw!! The partnership is broken and batsman is dismissed. It's the googly from bowler. batsman looks to work it through the on-side, but fails to make connection as the ball sneaked past the inside edge. Pitched outside off, impact on off, hitting off and middle, confirms HawkEye. Loud cheers, not for the wicket. MS is walking in. batsman lbw b bowler 56(43) [4s-5 6s-1]"
3145,"SIX, Mahendra Singh batsman is underway. Probably the slider down leg, batsman waltzes down, gets to the pitch and wallops it wide and over the long-on rope for a maximum. Tremendous bottom hand power"
3146,"FOUR, ah! That should have been either a single or a couple. Length ball outside off, Tiwary swung across the line and makes good connection. Simmons at long leg, slides across and makes contact with the rope while he had the ball in his hand"
3147,"SIX, Tiwary takes full toll of the free hit. Length ball right in the slot for Tiwary to clear his front leg and tonk it over long-on. If Pollard can't do anything about it, there's nothing anyone else could have done. Good start to the over for team"
3148,"no ball, FOUR, that's a horror delivery. Did that slip out of his hand? That should have been the case. A very high full toss on leg, Tiwary gets inside the line and swings his bat hard. Gets it fine of the fine leg fielder. No ball signalled"
3149,"SIX, brings up the 50-run stand in style. Helped by a mediocre delivery of course. You don't bowl length to this guy. batsman waits on the back foot and biffs it high and over"
3150,"SIX, it's high and it is handsome as well. Not quite off the middle but batsman will collect another six. 26 runs off the over. Third time this season, bowler has given more than 20 runs. Fullish ball outside off, batsman goes hard on his lofted off-drive. Rohit tried his best at long-off, but can't do much. He falls outside the boundary rope"
3151,"SIX, that's a special shot! Back of a length delivery, batsman opened up the off-side by backing away. He generates massive power and biffs it over cover for a maximum"
3152,"SIX, wow! Just wow! You can't do much when batsman is in such mood. Seam-up delivery from a goodish length, batsman decides to go downtown. Moves slightly off-side and bludgeons it over long-off for a gigantic hit"
3153,"FOUR, the Mumbai boy decides to take matters into his own hands and lays down the old traditional mow to send it away into the deep mid fence. One bounce and away she went"
3154,"FOUR, highish elbow, weight into the shot and a Test-matchesque shot gets the batsman a serene four. That was pitched up and the rest was done by batsman"
3155,"out Manoj Tiwary Run Out!! Two dot balls to end the over. Still 15 off it. Another pinpoint yorker, batsman squirts it out to the bowler. Manoj Tiwary is a long way down backing up. bowler easily removes the bails. Manoj Tiwary run out (bowler) 58(48) [4s-4 6s-2]"
3156,"FOUR, backs away and drives! That was again uppish, but the dive from the man at cover was never in contention to take that. It was close though!"
3157,"SIX, comes down the track and lofts the ball over long-on. That is a much needed tonic to this innings which was starting to go nowhere. A slight movement down the ground and then the smacking hit"
3158,"SIX, batsman comes down on it like a house on fire and dismantles the ball over long-off for a maximum"
3159,"FOUR, looks to push at it, the ball nips in from the surface and tickles the inside edge"
3160,"1 run, FIFTY for the combo! A reverse attempted by batsman and he manages to locate the man at short third man"
3161,"FOUR, up on his toes and off she goes! Backs away and creates all the room he wanted, flays Umesh Yadav up and over cover, no-one in the deep. Take four!"
3162,"SIX, that's a massive shot! No doubt, it's batsman. Slightly short, batsman sees it and is quick to jump back in his crease. Pummels the pull into the deep mid-wicket stands"
3163,"1 run, once again, no room on offer for batsman. It was a low full toss to batsman who was backing away. Mistimed drill to cover. Brings up the 50-run stand"
3164,"out Caught by Suryakumar Yadav!! The ploy to bring in NCN has worked. He has been superb at the death, but GG needed a wicket here. Fullish length delivery outside off, batsman doesn't get underneath it and goes hard on his lofted extra drive. Finds extra cover to perfection. batsman c Suryakumar Yadav b bowler 24(26) [4s-2 6s-1]"
3165,"out Bowled!! Two big wickets within a span of three balls. This will hurt the defending champions. Piyush bowler gets the big fish. batsman probably misjudged the length. Did that keep low? Not sure. It was a slider from a good length, batsman went back to pull it away. Misses it by a long way and the ball crashes the middle stump. Gauti is animated in his celebration. batsman b bowler 37(35) [4s-2 6s-2]"
3166,"FOUR, why do you bowl that? Easy runs on offer for batsman and he gets off the mark with a delightful stroke. Quicker and overpitched outside off, Yuvi plants his front leg forward and middles the drive. No chance for long-off"
3167,"FOUR, bit like Guptill. Slogs across the line and the head is tilted downards. Slowish offie on middle and leg, Shankar swings across the line and gets good wood behind it. One bounce and into the fence. The man in the deep probably didn't pick it up"
3168,"FOUR, Vijay Shankar isn't donning a helmet. I reckon, he should. Overpitched outside off, batsman smacks it down the ground. Shankar did well to evade that by ducking under. That went like a bullet"
3169,"SIX, this guy can hit it a long way. Yep, batsman is turning it on here at the Chinnaswamy. Once again, too full from Piyush bowler, Shankar clears his left leg and deposits it over long-on with a mighty lofted on-drive"
3170,"out Caught by Chawla!! In the air and taken. batsman has to depart. The short ball does the trick. Goes for the pull shot, doesn't time it as well as he would have liked it to. Finds deep square leg, who gobbles it up. Umesh Yadav is delighted. batsman c Chawla b bowler 9(9) [4s-2]"
3171,"FOUR, much needed boundary for team. A walk down the track from Shankar to on-drive the short of length delivery to the right of bowler. No chance for long-on. High elbow"
3172,"SIX, he was clueless against Narine. This is a confidence booster for Ojha. Slower ball right in the slot for Ojha to swing his bat hard. Moves slightly off-side and lifts it handsomely over long-on"
3173,"out Caught by Suryakumar Yadav!! Wicket off the first ball of the over and Shankar has to take the long walk back. Shortish ball from NCN, Shankar comes forward and looks to go downtown. Ends up slicing it miles up in the air. Yadav, at long-on takes it calmly. batsman c Suryakumar Yadav b bowler 22(17) [4s-2 6s-1]"
3174,"out Caught&Bowled!! Another one bites the dust. Three wickets in four balls for bowler. The ball stuck a bit on the surface. It was a shortish delivery, batsman is a bit early to close his bat face. The leading edge flies to the left of the bowler, who times his dive to his left to perfection. A terrific catch in his followthrough. batsman c and b bowler 0(1)"
3175,"FOUR, 140ks, short and wide. What does batsman do? No feet, just uses the leeway and forehand smacks it dead straight, over the umpire and into the fence"
3176,"FOUR, got complete hold of it this time. Umesh Yadav looks to bring the fine leg fielder into play. Tries the short ball again, but this one had no venom, right in the zone for batsman who hacks it away with blazing swing of the bat"
3177,"out Caught by Chris Lynn!! The off-pace delivery from a goodish length, Ojha wants to hoick it across the line, gets a fat outside edge that goes straight into the palms of Lynn at short third man. batsman c Chris Lynn b bowler 16(16) [6s-1]"
3178,"out Caught by Uthappa!! There you go. I have called it. Umesh Yadav has good memories the last time he played here. Got a 3-fer I reckon. Hits the deck hard and gets good bounce which keeps rising en route to batsman, he looks to loft high over the infield, but he has mistimed it big time. Uthappa calls for it, steadies himself with a forward dive to complete the catch. batsman c Uthappa b bowler 11(13) [4s-1]"
3179,"FOUR, class written all over it. Gives himself room outside leg and lofts Yusuf Pathan inside out over extra cover. Can't set field for that kind of a shot when you are gonna pitch around middle and leg, sheer brilliance from KW!"
3180,"SIX, batsman has mixed all his frustration and power on that shot. Attempted googly, lands too short for batsman's liking, he rocks back and fires it into the stands over mid-wicket"
3181,"FOUR, why worry when you can play shots like these? Walks well across his stumps and meets the ball with greatest of ease, chips the punchy on-drive over mid-wicket"
3182,"SIX, sure that time-out has helped KW. Settling into his groove now. Gets into position early and dispatches a short ball flat into the backward square stands"
3183,"FOUR, up on his toes and off she goes! Backs away and creates all the room he wanted, flays Umesh Yadav up and over cover, no-one in the deep. Take four!"
3184,"SIX, that's a massive shot! No doubt, it's batsman. Slightly short, batsman sees it and is quick to jump back in his crease. Pummels the pull into the deep mid-wicket stands"

Hits the deck hard and gets good bounce which keeps rising en route to batsman, he looks to loft high over the infield, but he has mistimed it big time.

3204,"SIX, sure that time-out has helped KW. Settling into his groove now. Gets into position early and dispatches a short ball flat into the backward square stands"
3205,"out Caught by Pollard!! This is a big wicket -- make no mistake about it. bowler was bowling from over the wicket, angles this in to cut the room on this preempted hoick over mid-wicket from Lynn. There's no arm-swinging space in front, the ball skids on to make it worse and Lynn holes out to the fielder at long-on, something Kevin Pietersen is ecstatic about on air. batsman c Pollard b bowler 4(8)"
3206,"SIX, here's the start. On the pedal. A wrong radar stuff this..down leg. Compounds the misery further with he front leg planted inside the line and then it is business as usual. The flattest of airy-sweeps you'd ever come across"
3207,"FOUR, the gallops are out. Jumps down, goes away, frees his arms and rubs the pressure inducing salts on the comeback. A half volley to help himself and throws everything his hands have on it to carve it through the covers"
3208,"FOUR, the sweet sweeps. More of them. Gets one right in the slot and the premeditation does the rest. Brooms it in front of square..and well past the hopes of those perched out there"
3209,"FOUR, now through the other side. A floater up on off, takes matters with the turn does Yadav, with a full-blooded inside-out drive. Doesn't even bother keeping it down"
3210,"FOUR, picks the bones out of this disguise. The literacy means that he reads the slower one, waits on it and mows it through mid-wicket. A serious move on this"
3211,"FOUR, a ground version of the helicopter. Not only does he share the same state, he shares the same shots too with the big man. The slower yorker, takes an eternity to dip down. Enough for the adjustment and a chopper to be unleashed. Talk about the precision in the placement too. Surgical in bisecting the two men at the fence"
3212,"out Caught by Johnson!! The end of the rebuilding. Courtesy a stunner in the deep. And some greedy batting to go with it. Karn after a few carters doesn't really mind floating it up and he does it again. Entices batsman into some feet dancing. Is obliged with the same. Just that in the process he gets too close to the pitch of the delivery and the tonk-slog attempted grabs only the toe-end of the blade to fly towards long-on. A jump, an arm raise and a reverse cup - as clean as a whistle executed by the man who claims to be 35. The best bowler figures in the IPL. A time-out with that. batsman c Johnson b bowler 28(31) [4s-3]"
3213,"out Caught by Rayudu!! Ends a troubled stay. Without getting his timing right, batsman tries an uppish loft. Doesn't bother moving his feet though. Doesn't bother reaching out as well. Doesn't even bother to read the slower one. Stands, swings, toe-ends and mid-off does the rest. Kolkata innings falling apart. More to their own self-ignition. batsman c Rayudu b bowler 2(6)"
3214,"SIX, here's the first of his dispatches. Where were you hiding batsman? Gets a friendly length ball - yes. But times the leather off it with a swivelling hack. Right off the screws and right into the crowd over mid-wicket"
3215,"out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! Howrah bridge is falling down. Without repair. After the softening blow, bowler goes for his ideal sucker delivery. Full, slowed up and batsman once again looks to use the pace with his lofted slog. Nope, none of it coming this time. Flies off the cue-end down the throat of deep mid-wicket. batsman c Hardik Pandya b bowler 6(4) [6s-1]"
3216,"out Caught by Malinga!! Talk of dreamy bowling figures. 3 wickets, 2 runs. This is a T20 mind you. And a qualifier too. bowler helps himself to a few free ones. Bangs it in short, Yadav wants to pull it into the river. The sluggish pitch makes him wait and then spits the ball up too. Just the top edge but Malinga swirls all under it at long leg, almost messes it up and then dives to bring about a massive smile on his face. batsman c Malinga b bowler 31(25) [4s-2 6s-1]"
3217,"FOUR, the perfect yorker. Right in the blockhole. Deserved nothing lesser than respect. Gets the boundary to its name instead. batsman just about jams his bat down in the way, gets the inside edge and then banks on his luck to take it past the stumps"
3218,"out Bowled!! Three slower death rattles - batsman hoodwinks the first two. But the third one lights up Chinnaswamy. Whoa, talk of the ball dipping. Gets it straight on the stumps this time does bowler, gets it slow and right on the base. Nothing that can be done with it but play all around it and Kolkata come to a grinding halt. batsman b bowler 4(7) [4s-1]"
3219,"FOUR, so he gets a pitched up delivery from bowler and drives a boundary away. Why not. Room outside off, half a stride to middle it and off she goes through covers!"
3220,"SIX, there you go. Picks it off his pads and just hoicks it away with disdain. Waits in the crease and swings his bat at the right time, poppin' the ball over deep square leg"
3221,"out Stumped!! Hoodwinked by the wrong 'un. No heroics from batsman then, who stormed to IPL's fastest fifty at this very ground in the league stage. Shimmies out ambitiously but bowler's bowling in the powerplay for a reason. Sees him doing that, bowls a tossed-up googly and gets him stumped. Easy take for the keeper and a disparaging flick of the bails. batsman st Parthiv Patel b bowler 10(10) [6s-1]"
3222,"out Lbw!! 144ks inducker nails him in front. Gets the ball to skid on after bowling the last ball a tad slower, and hurries him into a surprise. Nipped back in and rapped the pad above the knee-roll, but since batsman was caught so deep in the crease - having read neither the line, length or the pace - he looks plumb. Umpire thinks for a few seconds and raises his finger. Ball tracking: shows it clipping the top of leg-stump. batsman lbw b bowler 1(3)"
3223,"FOUR, inside-out over covers. Perhaps only Raina matches him there. Reads the flight early, drags himself inside the line and then goes over covers. Boundary"
3224,"out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! Now he's set him up beautifully. Fired the last one flatter and quicker, and bowls this loopier. batsman, to his credit, looked to have middled it - well, it sounded like that - but he finds the deep mid-wicket fielder like how you would when things aren't going your way. A struggle of an innings, coming on the day team least required it. Where from here for team? batsman c Hardik Pandya b bowler 12(15) [4s-2]"
3225,"out Lbw!! This is anticlimactically entertaining. Didn't read the googly at all. Was bowled flat and straight on off, the ball cut in and pinned batsman in front. He had no clue. Was making room and the ball skid on to pin the back pad. What a good selection he's turning out to be. Big game, so there was every temptation to go for Harbhajan but Rohit persisted with him and see what he's done. Third wicket for just 8 runs. And he has two overs left for goodness sake. batsman lbw b bowler 0(1)"
3226,"out Caught by Pollard!! This is a big wicket -- make no mistake about it. bowler was bowling from over the wicket, angles this in to cut the room on this preempted hoick over mid-wicket from Lynn. There's no arm-swinging space in front, the ball skids on to make it worse and Lynn holes out to the fielder at long-on, something Kevin Pietersen is ecstatic about on air. batsman c Pollard b bowler 4(8)"

3229,"FOUR, the sweet sweeps. More of them. Gets one right in the slot and the premeditation does the rest. Brooms it in front of square..and well past the hopes of those perched out there"
3230,"FOUR, now through the other side. A floater up on off, takes matters with the turn does Yadav, with a full-blooded inside-out drive. Doesn't even bother keeping it down"
3231,"FOUR, picks the bones out of this disguise. The literacy means that he reads the slower one, waits on it and mows it through mid-wicket. A serious move on this"
3232,"FOUR, a ground version of the helicopter. Not only does he share the same state, he shares the same shots too with the big man. The slower yorker, takes an eternity to dip down.

3233,"out Caught by Johnson!! The end of the rebuilding. Courtesy a stunner in the deep. And some greedy batting to go with it.

Doesn't even bother to read the slower one. Stands, swings, toe-ends and mid-off does the rest. Kolkata innings falling apart. More to their own self-ignition. batsman c Rayudu b bowler 2(6)"
3235,"SIX, here's the first of his dispatches. Where were you hiding batsman? Gets a friendly length ball - yes. But times the leather off it with a swivelling hack. Right off the screws and right into the crowd over mid-wicket"
3236,"out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! Howrah bridge is falling down. Without repair. After the softening blow, bowler goes for his ideal sucker delivery. Full, slowed up and batsman once again looks to use the pace with his lofted slog. Nope, none of it coming this time. Flies off the cue-end down the throat of deep mid-wicket. batsman c Hardik Pandya b bowler 6(4) [6s-1]"
3237,"out Caught by Malinga!! Talk of dreamy bowling figures. 3 wickets, 2 runs. This is a T20 mind you. And a qualifier too. bowler helps himself to a few free ones. Bangs it in short, Yadav wants to pull it into the river. The sluggish pitch makes him wait and then spits the ball up too. Just the top edge but Malinga swirls all under it at long leg, almost messes it up and then dives to bring about a massive smile on his face. batsman c Malinga b bowler 31(25) [4s-2 6s-1]"
3238,"FOUR, the perfect yorker. Right in the blockhole. Deserved nothing lesser than respect. Gets the boundary to its name instead. batsman just about jams his bat down in the way, gets the inside edge and then banks on his luck to take it past the stumps"
3239,"out Bowled!! Three slower death rattles - batsman hoodwinks the first two. But the third one lights up Chinnaswamy. Whoa, talk of the ball dipping. Gets it straight on the stumps this time does bowler, gets it slow and right on the base. Nothing that can be done with it but play all around it and Kolkata come to a grinding halt. batsman b bowler 4(7) [4s-1]"
3240,"FOUR, so he gets a pitched up delivery from bowler and drives a boundary away. Why not. Room outside off, half a stride to middle it and off she goes through covers!"
3241,"SIX, there you go. Picks it off his pads and just hoicks it away with disdain. Waits in the crease and swings his bat at the right time, poppin' the ball over deep square leg"
3242,"out Stumped!! Hoodwinked by the wrong 'un. No heroics from batsman then, who stormed to IPL's fastest fifty at this very ground in the league stage. Shimmies out ambitiously but bowler's bowling in the powerplay for a reason. Sees him doing that, bowls a tossed-up googly and gets him stumped. Easy take for the keeper and a disparaging flick of the bails. batsman st Parthiv Patel b bowler 10(10) [6s-1]"
3243,"out Lbw!! 144ks inducker nails him in front. Gets the ball to skid on after bowling the last ball a tad slower, and hurries him into a surprise. Nipped back in and rapped the pad above the knee-roll, but since batsman was caught so deep in the crease - having read neither the line, length or the pace - he looks plumb. Umpire thinks for a few seconds and raises his finger. Ball tracking: shows it clipping the top of leg-stump. batsman lbw b bowler 1(3)"
3244,"FOUR, inside-out over covers. Perhaps only Raina matches him there. Reads the flight early, drags himself inside the line and then goes over covers. Boundary"
3245,"out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! Now he's set him up beautifully. Fired the last one flatter and quicker, and bowls this loopier. batsman, to his credit, looked to have middled it - well, it sounded like that - but he finds the deep mid-wicket fielder like how you would when things aren't going your way. A struggle of an innings, coming on the day team least required it. Where from here for team? batsman c Hardik Pandya b bowler 12(15) [4s-2]"
3246,"out Lbw!! This is anticlimactically entertaining. Didn't read the googly at all. Was bowled flat and straight on off, the ball cut in and pinned batsman in front. He had no clue. Was making room and the ball skid on to pin the back pad. What a good selection he's turning out to be. Big game, so there was every temptation to go for Harbhajan but Rohit persisted with him and see what he's done. Third wicket for just 8 runs. And he has two overs left for goodness sake. batsman lbw b bowler 0(1)"
3247,"FOUR, in the airrrr, in the gap and a poor effort from Dan Christian meant the ball escaped for four. He had to dive, thought about it, but took a long while to react. Sundar bowls full and outside off stump, Krunal lofts the drive inside-out, could have been cut off by the man running from long-off"
3248,"out Caught by SN Thakur!! What a moment in the game. Look at the celebrations in the team camp. They reckon they've pocketed the game. batsman is livid with himself. Swings his bat hard in disappointment. He knows that he's hit a long hop to the fielder. Short and on the stumps, batsman went back, lost balance while playing the pull shot, didn't middle it, Thakur jumped at deep mid-wicket and took the catch. The momentum was taking him back, took a couple of steps back, just managed to stay away from the rope and the third impire was convinced he didn't touch the boundary. batsman c SN Thakur b bowler 24(22) [4s-4]"
3249,"SIX, wowww! What a start. This is the very venue where batsman grabbed eyeballs during a champions league T20 game against New South Wales back in 2009. Looks like he's going to counterattack. Flighted delivery outside off stump, batsman muscles it high over long-off"
3250,"out Caught by Manoj Tiwary!! Is there MS Dhoni's mind behind this dismissal? team fans would know. In 2010, he had a straightish mid-off to dismiss the dangerous batsman in the final. Now team got a very straight long-off - a field placement you normally don't see in cricket - and batsman hits it straight to him. This was full and in the slot from bowler, batsman was in the mood to murder the ball, he went hard, hit it flat and hard, but little did he know that he fell in the trap. It's 65 for 5 now. batsman c Manoj Tiwary b bowler 7(3) [6s-1]"
3251,"SIX, what a hit from the younger Pandya. Flighted delivery outside off stump, Hardik doesn't try to over-hit the ball, just lofts inside out over long-off and timed it sweetly enough to clear the rope"
3252,"out Lbw!! People were talking about slower balls, spinners doing the damage, but this bloke has run in, bowled fast and found reverse swing to trap Hardik plumb in front. A great choice of delivery with Hardik walking across the stumps. Credit to the bowler if it was a deliberate ploy to opt for the full pace delivery. This was on a good length, tailed back in, batsman played across the line and the impact was right in front of middle stump. Would have at least clipped the top of middle and off. batsman lbw b bowler 10(9) [6s-1]"
3253,"out batsman Run Out!! Dropped, but batsman is run-out. An absolute pandemonium out there. Who would have thought that a team that played so well and topped the league stage would find themselves at 79 for 7 in the 15th over of the final. And that too after opting to bat first. Rohit Sharma can't watch from the sidelines. Coming to the delivery, this one swung away from the left-hander, Karn got a thick outside edge which went low to Christian's left at first slip. He couldn't hold on, meanwhile Karn thought of stealing a run, his partner wasn't sure and in the end he was stranded in the middle of the pitch. Great presence of mind from the bowler to run towards the striker's end and effect the run-out. batsman run out (Christian/bowler) 1(5)"
3254,"SIX, that has been flat-batted with a lot of sinewy power! The short ball angled across and batsman thwarted it down the ground despite not connecting it with the meat of the bat"
3255,"byes, 1 run, looks for the deft upper cut and misses. The ball lands on a couple of bounces to the keeper, who fumbles to allow the single. The man at short third man mopped it up and had a shy at the bowler's end. Had there been a direct hit, it would have been another casualty"
3256,"FOUR, length ball, no room, batsman opens his arms and carves it away past point. The man at sweeper cover dived to make the tackle but in vain"
3257,"SIX, the slower ball disappears now! He held his stroke back a bit, the ball chalked the toe-end of the bat and landed well over the cow-corner for a towering, welcoming six for team"
3258,"FOUR, full on the sticks, nothing really wrong with the ball. But batsman moved across his line and slogged the ball away to the deep mid region for a four. Krunal is getting some momentum for team"
3259,"SIX, batsman is tonking them big now. That was a length ball, full and wide, batsman smacks it down the ground with one knee on the ground. That sailed over long-on pretty easily"
3260,"1 run, the partnership between batsman and Krunal Pandya is now 50!! Short ball, pulled away and the ball lands on the bounce to be picked up by Rahane at deep mid"
3261,"out Caught by SN Thakur!! The early pressure has resulted in the fall of Parthiv. This was a back of a length delivery on the stumps, it was the slower one as well. Parthiv was in no position on the pull, went high off the bat and lobbed towards Shardul at mid-on. He runs forward and accepts the catch gleefully. Just the start team wanted - they have been on the dot and created the pressure on the batsmen. batsman c SN Thakur b bowler 4(6)"
3262,"out Caught&Bowled!! 'Phenomenal catch', says Matthew Hayden on air. That's a catch that might well tilt this final towards team. bowler is having a ball at the moment, this was another slower ball, he rolled his fingers across the seam. batsman was looking to nudge it towards the on-side, was through with the shot even before it arrived, gets a thick leading edge that popped back towards the bowler. bowler was on his followthrough, pushes his left hand across - it was dropping down on him, he bends down really low and completes a fine one-handed catch. The momentum was always going across him, but he held on - even as his elbow hit the ground. Mobbed by his mates, rightly so. batsman c and b bowler 3(8)"
3263,out Caught by Rahane!! No such luck for Pandya. The short ball is banged in slow. The batsman tried to fetch it from outside off and only manages to sky it up in the air. The man from deep mid - Rahane charges in and takes it easily. Pune need 130 to win! batsman c Rahane b bowler 47(38) [4s-3 6s-2]
3264,"FOUR, first boundary of the final, Ferguson offers a freebie, it was a half-volley outside off. batsman waits on it, opens the face of the bat at the last moment and squeezes it behind square on the off-side, beats backward point and rolls away to the fence"
3265,"FOUR, Ferguson is relieving some pressure off batsman and team. Length ball on his pads, batsman gleefully puts it away behind square on the on-side. It went in the air - but well wide of Unadkat at short fine"
3266,"FOUR, edged and four, streaky but batsman will take it. On a good length and holding its line outside off, batsman was looking to drive, the late wobble takes the edge and rolls away through the vacant slip region"
3267,"FOUR, classy, shot of ther final so far - on a good length and well wide of off. batsman stands tall and drives it on the up - splits the gap between cover and cover-point, no need to run for those. 16 from the over and Ravi Shastri notes that team have doubled their score"
3268,"FOUR, poor ball from bowler, dropped it short and wide of off, batsman waits on it and cuts it hard, beats backward point to his left and rolls away to the fence"
3269,"out batsman Run Out!! Excellent cricket from the team captain and team have lost their third wicket. Coming to the ball, it was full and just outside off, batsman came down the track, made room and drove it towards mid-off. There was a single there - at least batsman thought as he called for a quick single. Smith moved across to his left, turned around and broke the stumps at the bowler's end - all in one motion. batsman was scrambling across, but falls well short. batsman run out (Smith) 12(15) [4s-1]"

3293,"FOUR, cracking shot! First boundary of the innings. batsman walks down the track and in the process moves leg-side, which allows him to free his arms. The length was on the shorter side and batsman slapped it away over wide mid-off"
3294,"FOUR, in the air, over the 30-yard circle and goes for a boundary. Angled across on a fuller length and batsman is bending forward to hammer the drive. Slices over the cover region off the outside half and the quick outfield does the rest. Not a pacy ball"
3295,"SIX, has he got enough on it? Jusssst. Shimmied down and swung hard, got it close to the bottom of the bat but the muscle behind it was good enough"
3296,"FOUR, half-volley from bowler, duly hammered back through mid-off. team need a flurry of these to bring some life back in this contest"
3297,"out Caught by Suryakumar Yadav!! bowler is too clever for batsman here. He saw him coming down and bowled this cutter pretty wide. batsman still throws his bat at it, only managing to lob it off the toe-end. No troubles for Surya at mid-off. You never say never, but it would take something sensational for team to turn this around. batsman c Suryakumar Yadav b bowler 12(13) [4s-1]"
3298,"SIX, good start this from Bravo. He picked the previous two deliveries and now he gets his dancing shoes on to get to the pitch of the ball. It's followed by his trademark flourish to launch it over long-on"
3299,"out Stumped!! Oh dear. It's easy to be critical of players sometimes, but what was batsman thinking here. First ball against a bowler who's bowling so well, he comes galloping down for an ugly slog. Completely done in by the length as this googly slips through the inside edge for an easy stumping. batsman st Ishan Kishan b bowler 0(1)"
3300,"FOUR, stuck in the crease while flashing a drive away from the body, runs away off the edge for four. Third man was up in the ring"
3301,"FOUR, McClenaghan has let this sneak right through him. Poor from the fast bowler. bowler turns around in disgust. Good length ball slanted outside off, squirted off a thick edge and should have only been a single down to third man"
3302,"FOUR, Bravo keeps fighting. He charges down the track while making enough room for himself to carve this short ball over cover. It was more of a slice, but he's still able to beat sweeper cover to his right"
3303,"out Caught by Bumrah!! Strange shot from batsman, almost waving this short ball down to third man. Probably he got a bit too cramped for room, so he couldn't go through with this upper cut. Nothing shot in the end, just gliding it down the fielder's throat. Bravo has started well at the other end, but he's now in danger of running out of partners. batsman c Bumrah b bowler 8(5) [4s-1]"
3304,"SIX, stunning shot over extra-cover from Bravo. For once, bowler offers a length which the batsman can get under, and Bravo - leaning back - smokes it inside-out. How did he manage to generate that power! Hits flush on the cushions"
3305,"out Caught by Mustafizur!! Oh boy, how lucky is Pandya! Filthy drag-down on leg-stump, but instead of hitting it into Churchgate station, Wood hits it straight down fine leg's throat. Pandya is struggling though as he immediately bends over in evident pain. Absolutely no joy on his face for the wicket. batsman c Mustafizur b bowler 1(3)"
3306,"SIX, full ball on middle, Bravo gets his front leg out of the way and belts it over long-off. Not a clean contact, but this isn't the biggest ground"
3307,"SIX, back-to-back sixes! Sublime wrists from Bravo as he whips it off the pads and sends it sailing into the deep mid-wicket stands"
3308,"FOUR, bangs it in short seeing Bravo advance, but is still spanked away into the boundary. He's got himself in that kind of zone, where most things are disappearing"
3309,"SIX, this is awesome. This is so awesome. bowler - one of best T20 bowlers going around - has been effortlessly creamed into the long-off stands. Fifty off just 25 balls for Bravo. Now this should set the cat among the pigeons"
3310,"SIX, Hardik Pandya slaps the seat in frustration as he sits in the dugout. Another six. This game has come alive out of nowhere. bowler goes round the wicket, bowls a full toss on the pads and is whipped over mid-wicket"
3311,"SIX, Wankhede is coming unglued here. The stadium is rocking for Bravo. Low full toss, he's heaved it over deep mid-wicket, just over the fielder"
3312,"out Caught by Rohit!! A 20-run over from bowler has been redeemed right at the end. Bravo's gone. But has the damage been done? Short ball, Bravo swings hard but slices it up to extra-cover. Seven needed from six. Get ready to lose your mind. batsman c Rohit b bowler 68(30) [4s-3 6s-7]"
3313,"SIX, he's scooped this for six, he's scooped this for six. batsman.... Oh my. Imran Tahir drops his bat and runs across to hug Jadhav. There's another run to go, but he doesn't care. Good length cutter angled across off, Jadhav bends over - bad hamstring and all - and finds the leverage to lift it over short fine leg. Chennai players are clapping violently"
3314,"FOUR, he has done it! Make way for the men in yellow, for there are plenty of them who are storming to the middle to jump over Jadhav. Careful of that hamstring though. Oh forget about it, no one cares anymore. Full ball from bowler, drilled through the covers. What a finish. Unbelievable"
3315,"FOUR, nine off the over! Fuller length delivery attacking the stumps, batsman stays leg-side of the ball and creams the drive through vacant extra cover"
3316,"SIX, glorious shot! And that's gone all the way. Wow. Fuller ball and Pandya got it swing away in the air. Doesn't bother batsman, who walked forward, crouched low and elevated it over extra cover. Off the meat of the bat"
3317,out Caught by Lewis!! batsman holes out in the deep. The slower ball does the trick. It was bowled at 120kph and batsman didn't pick that. Covered the line and moved across to flick. Plays a touch too early and that leads to his downfall. Off the lower protion of the bat. The ball settles straight into the hands of Lewis at long leg. Straightforward catch. Mumbai have the breakthrough! batsman c Lewis b bowler 16(14) [4s-1 6s-1]
3318,"FOUR, a wicket and 12 runs off the over! Pandya slightly overpitches and batsman took full toll of it. Bent forward and laced the drive wide of mid-off"
3319,"FOUR, nice batting! Moved slightly towards leg-side as the bowler was running to deliver the ball. That allowed him to free his arms. Shortish ball and batsman cracked it over cover-point. Powerfully hit and in the gap as well"
3320,"1 run, direct hit would have made things interesting. Another slower ball, the knuckle ball this time. batsman gets squared up and defends off the outside part to backward point. The fielder has a shy at the stumps, misses by a long way and Raina is hit on his wrists. A direct hit would have been curtains for the southpaw"
3321,"out Caught by Krunal Pandya!! The Pandya brothers have scalped batsman here. Normal-paced hit-the-deck-hard back of a length delivery from Hardik. batsman backwed away and wanted to go over the in-field, with this being the last ball of the powerplay. Mistimes it off the top poetion of the bat and finds mid-on. Krunal takes a step back and grabs it over his head. batsman c Krunal Pandya b bowler 4(6)"
3322,"out Lbw!! Two dots and batsman is trapped lbw. He has a chat with his partner and takes the right call - doesn't review. What a start for Mayank bowler! After two leg-breaks, he bowls a googly and gets a wicket off the third ball in his IPL career. A premeditated shot attempted by batsman. Got down on his knee and tried to play the booming sweep shot. Missed and got hit on the back thigh in front of middle. That's plumb. batsman lbw b bowler 22(19) [4s-4]"
3323,out Lbw!! batsman doesn't spot the googly and pinned in front of middle. Chris Gaffaney shakes his head in denial. That looked plumb. Mumbai Indians review. Fair delivery. Nothing on the UltraEdge. Three reds and batsman is gone for a single digit score. bowler is having a ball here at the Wankhede. Second wicket for him with the wrong 'un. Should have been three. The quickish googly and batsman wasn't commited - either on the front foot or on the back foot. Didn't pick it at all and got beaten on the inside edge by a fair margin. The impact was on the back leg adjacent to off and middle. Can't get more plumb than that. batsman lbw b bowler 5(5)
3324,"FOUR, first boundary of IPL 2018, first runs of the tournament as well, on a good length and well outside off, batsman's feet went nowhere as he extended his arms on the drive, hits it in the air and through the gap at extra-cover, no one moved"
3325,"FOUR, not an ideal start for Imran bowler in this IPL. Too full outside off, batsman slammed it straight of long-off where DJ Bravo fumbles after putting a desperate dive to his left"
3326,"SIX, clears his front leg and whacks bowler over long-on. The fielder there seemed interested for a fleeting moment, but batsman got a decent piece of it"
3327,"FOUR, boom! bowler is spraying it full, batsman pouncing on it like a famished tiger. Uses his bottom hand power to biff it straight down the ground, whistles past the non-striker"
3328,"FOUR, they are going for the shots now. Short ball, arrives lazily...gives batsman ample time to pick his spot, he bludgeons the pull over mid-wicket with disdain"
3329,"FOUR, through Jaddu's fingers at mid-off. Length ball outside off, batsman stays leg-side of the ball and carves it flirtingly past the fieldsman at mid-off. Jaddu leapt full length, but the execution from Yadav was too good"
3330,"FOUR, showing his range now batsman. Doesn't shy away from staying good few inches outside the crease and thumps the ball over a helpless mid-off this time. Gee, this is some clean striking"
3331,"out Caught by Harbhajan!! Second wicket for Watto and a much-needed one for team. bowler doesn't deviate from his tried and tested ploy which is to dig it short at a subtle, slower pace, batsman falls into the trap and mistimes the pull into the mitts of Bhajji at long leg. A set trap this and batsman departs after an entertaining knock. batsman c Harbhajan b bowler 43(29) [4s-6 6s-1]"
3332,"FOUR, easily done. Short ball angling into the body, Pandya half-ducks and swats, the ball grazes the top edge and runs away..."
3333,"FOUR, can't stop batsman, not when he gets short balls. bowler went wide of the crease and sprayed this in to cramp Pandya up for room, but what does Pandya do? Just arches back nonchalantly and ramps the ball cleanly with an open bat face via third man"
3334,"out Caught by Mark Wood!! Aimless swing at the ball and the result? Caught at short third man. Walks across, gets down on one knee and swings hard at a googly, always a risk playing against the turn and thus, the top-edge lands as a dolly in the hands of the Durham lad. batsman c Mark Wood b bowler 40(29) [4s-4 6s-1]"
3335,"FOUR, the big brother is taking no sighters. He wants a move-on rightaway. Gets a half-volley outside off and batsman slam-bangs it through covers. Don't bother running.."
3336,"SIX, batsman second guessed bowler there. Waits for the slower short ball and marmalizes it into the mid-wicket stands with zero tolerance..."
3337,"FOUR, pace can be your enemy sometimes, like on this occasion when you lose your radar. Short and slipping down leg, batsman gets inside the line and tickles it away past a diving short fine to his left"
3338,"FOUR, what do you do when your big brother plays shots like that. Just stand and admire at the other end. Hardik Pandya restricted to a spectator role this over and rightly so. Half-volley from bowler, deserved to be punished, batsman lashes it through covers making life difficult for the fielders inside the ring"
3339,"FOUR, pitched up outside off, batsman clears his front leg and hammers it straight past the non-striker. No-one's stopping that"
3340,"FOUR, an action replay of the previous delivery, only difference? batsman hit this dead straight. Overpitched, sent racing into the fence with a absolute thwack of the willow"
3341,"SIX, a poor outing for bowler on his IPL debut. Was too predictable on most occasions. batsman prepares himself for a short delivery and swings the pull with full flow into the square leg stands"
3342,"2 runs, off-pace, on a good length outside off, batsman stands outside off-stump and pumps it down to long-on. Krunal Pandya forced his brother for the second and they make it easily in the end"
3343,"out Lbw!! A duck on his IPL debut for batsman, but he wants a review. It's for a LBW call, umpire Gaffaney was quick to raise his finger, it's a fair delivery, the ball swung back in and thudded into batsman's pads, he fell over on the flick and missed. Ultraedge confirms that there's no bat. Hawk-Eye in and it's umpire's call on hitting. Stays with the original decision and batsman is OUT. A piece of history created in the IPL, batsman becomes the first player to use DRS. This was full and swung back into the left-hander, batsman fell across on the flick and missed, bowler was on all fours as he turned back in appeal, the impact was in front of middle and leg, the ball was skimming the outer half of leg-stump. Good enough for the decision to stand. batsman lbw b bowler 0(2)"
3344,"SIX, lovely, this should give plenty of confidence for batsman, on a good length and well wide of off, batsman reaches out, plays with an open face and slices it high and over cover, has enough to clear the ropes on the full"
3345,"out Caught by Rayudu!! This was coming, batsman never looked at home and he's sent packing, huge blow for the Mumbai Indians, they have been rocked early in their fortress. On a good length and a hint of shape away from the right-hander, batsman was looking to clout it over mid-wicket, doesn't cover for the movement, gets a thick top-edge, high and towards backward point. Rayudu - his partner until last season, calls for the high catch, keeps his cool and holds onto it. Dream start for the Super KIngs on their return from wilderness. batsman c Rayudu b bowler 15(18) [4s-1 6s-1]"
3346,"FOUR, cracking shot, the shot of the day so far, fraction short and just wide of off, Suryakumar stands tall and punches it in front of square on the off-side, beats cover and rolls away to the fence"
3347,"FOUR, lovely, Suryakumar is looking attractive, back of a length and just outside off, Suryakumar stays back, gets on top of the bounce and punches it into the gap past cover, no need to run for those"
3348,"SIX, beautifully played, too full and too straight from bowler, ends up drifting onto Suryakumar's pads, he prods across, picks up the length and flicks it stylishly over mid-wicket, has enough to clear the ropes on the full"
3349,"FOUR, nicely played by Kishan, fraction too full and wide of off, Kishan lunges across and then plays a cross-batted swipe past cover, the fielder in the deep at long-off is very square and has no chance"
3350,"FOUR, nicely played by Kishan, this was dropped short and well wide of off, Kishan waits on it, opens the face of the bat at the last moment and then dabs it past MS's gloves, RJ has his hands on his head, but that was supremely well played"
3351,"FOUR, cracking shot, too short and too wide of off, Suryakumar makes room and clatters it past cover, no chance for the man in the deep"
3352,"out Caught by Axar!! In the air.....gone! Went miles up in the air but unfortunately for Shankar, he hasn't got the distance on this one. It was banged in short by Mohit and Shankar went for the pull. Struck him high on the blade and flew towards deep mid-wicket where Axar settled under the skier. Easy catch. Shankar was trying to force the pace a bit but just couldn't execute the stroke well. batsman c Axar b bowler 13(13)"
3353,"FOUR, crunched away! Too full from Mohit and batsman lays into the drive, smashes it towards wide long-off where Karun put in a desperate slide. Got a hand on it but couldn't stop it cleanly. First boundary for batsman"
3354,"1 run, very full and outside off, drilled down the ground to long-off, 36th IPL fifty for batsman! What a way to start the season! He's looked ominous right from the word go today"
3355,"FOUR, not entirely in control but gets the result. Another slower ball variation from Tye and batsman is early into the slog. Skies it high towards deep mid-wicket but it's in the gap. Finds the fence"
3356,"SIX, oh ho ho! Middles this like a dream! That sound off the blade, wow! Back of a length, sits up nicely for batsman who smokes it deep into the stands at mid-wicket. It was just a bit of a short arm jab, such power from the young man"
3357,"FOUR, batsman has switched onto top gear! We could be in for some real carnage if he bats for a while. Attempted slower bouncer but batsman gets inside the line in a flash and pulls it easily over short fine leg. Proactive batting and Tye is under serious pressure here"
3358,"FOUR, such strong bottom hand! Wow! This kid certainly packs a punch, doesn't he? Fired fuller by bowler and batsman was on the charge, adjusts to drill it powerfully past the bowler. Long-on had no chance"
3359,"out Caught by Andrew Tye!! bowler has his revenge! Must say this was an ugly stroke from batsman, lost his shape completely on the slog after using his feet. It was looped up nicely and was the one that spun across him, too much to do for the southpaw and all he managed to do was slice it high towards extra cover. What about the catch though? Tye had to backtrack with his back to the ball but judged it beautifully and timed the slide really well. Massive wicket for team. batsman was looking deadly. batsman c Andrew Tye b bowler 28(13) [4s-4 6s-1]"
3360,"FOUR, what a shot to start! Gee, Tewatia has come out with a mission. Doesn't bother to have a look at bowler's variation and opts for the reverse sweep straight away. It was the same shot that got Munro but Tewatia connects well to send it soaring over backward point"
3361,"out Gambhir Run Out!! Brilliance from Mujeeb! Direct hits are always dangerous and it's proven this time. Slower ball on leg, Tye got away with this delivery as fine leg was up in the ring. Mujeeb was quick to attack the ball and threw down the stumps at the keeper's end in a flash. Initially seemed like Gambhir made it but he was just short. These direct hits I tell you. This Afghan lad is a champion, isn't he? What a debut! Gambhir run out (Mujeeb) 55(42) [4s-5 6s-1]"
3362,"out Lbw!! Another reverse sweep dismissal! Tewatia started his innings with a similar one but this time, like Munro earlier in the afternoon, misses it to be trapped LBW. Tewatia tries to repeat the stroke but ends up losing his balance and is all over the place as he gets pinged before the stumps. Looked dead plumb. Probably didn't pick the leg break at all. team chipping away at the wickets here at the back end. DD need a strong finish. batsman lbw b bowler 9(7) [4s-1]"
3363,"SIX, H-U-G-E! When this man connects well, the ball is going to fly deep into the stands. Slower ball on a good length, Morris preempted the charge down the track and had a clean golf-like swing. Way into the crowd at long-on. Much-needed one for DD"
3364,"SIX, smacked away! Takes full toll of the extra delivery, does batsman. Full and in the slot for him, he just hacks it over deep mid-wicket for a maximum. DD needed that badly, they certainly did"
3365,"FOUR, just wide of Tye's outstretched hands running to his left from deep mid-wicket. Had a lot of work to do but was never really going to get to it. Slower ball on a shortish length and Morris went for the forehand smash. Mistimed it but luckily, got it in the gap. Or nearly in the gap. Doesn't matter how they come as long as they do"
3366,"out Lbw!! There's that early wicket that bowler is so used to. Takes three balls to take his first wicket in IPL. batsman preempts the reverse-sweep but loses his balance altogether in doing so. bowler ripped the ball a little extra with his index finger, meaning the ball was drifting in and gaining pace off the deck. Skids on and pins batsman on the thigh. batsman lbw b bowler 4(6)"
3367,"out Bowled!! Kaboom! Who says the yorker has gone out of fashion? It never has and it never will. Lovely yorker from Mohit, on the base of off stump and batsman was making room to slam it through cover. Too good a nut for him and he fails to get his bat down in time. Timber it is! DD finish on 166/7. Is it enough? batsman b bowler 13(13) [6s-1]"
3368,"FOUR, quintessentially batsman. bowler was from round the wicket to the left-hander, batsman charges down whilst making some room and lofts it through extra cover. Superb hit"
3369,"FOUR, now a one-kneed stylish slog-whip over deep square leg. bowler fired it in and sees it flying round the corner"
3370,"SIX, wow. Just wow. This is sheer timing. Also shows you how good the pitch is. Makes some early room down leg and just chips it. Carries well over the long-off boundary. See it to believe it"
3371,"FOUR, lovely shot again. Makes room as he charges out and clouts it inside-out over extra cover. He'll keep doing that all day"
3372,"no run, a review for LBW. Looks high to the naked eye but gee that's hit batsman on the back pad, above the knee roll. Carrom ball I think, which skids on instead of turning away. Beats the batsman for pace and goes through Iyer, who's standing on his back foot to meet that. Ball-tracking is in and it's umpire's call on height, as suspected"
3373,"FOUR, cracks away a pull shot. Who said he's not good with the short balls. Rises in sync with the height on this short delivery and pumps it through square leg. Another great shot today from the master"
3374,"SIX, that's a shot with wings. Lands deep into the crowd. Time for batsman to use his feet. Ingests the flight and burps out an 85-meter six over bowler's head"
3375,"out Caught by Rahul!! Gone. Hit a six earlier in the over and now perishes in trying to drive along the ground. That's modern cricket in a nutshell. A bit of drift away from the batsman, which is why batsman stretched his front foot right across, but a bit of spin did him in. Something that you didn't expect out of bowler but he's produced it. batsman c Rahul b bowler 11(11) [6s-1]"
3376,"FOUR, top-edge through fine leg. A delivery going down leg from over the wicket, the left-hander is in no shape to sweep that. Goes for it and gets lucky"
3377,"out Caught by Axar!! In the air.....gone! Went miles up in the air but unfortunately for Shankar, he hasn't got the distance on this one. It was banged in short by Mohit and Shankar went for the pull. Struck him high on the blade and flew towards deep mid-wicket where Axar settled under the skier. Easy catch.

3380,"FOUR, not entirely in control but gets the result. Another slower ball variation from Tye and batsman is early into the slog. Skies it high towards deep mid-wicket but it's in the gap. Finds the fence"

3401,"FOUR, top-edge through fine leg. A delivery going down leg from over the wicket, the left-hander is in no shape to sweep that. Goes for it and gets lucky"
3402,"FOUR, here he is! Not wasting any time. He's at it. It's a tossed up delivery around off, batsman grounds his knee and pummels it dead straight over the bowler's head. Four runs!"
3403,"SIX, a maximum! Even better than the first one. Loopy delivery around off, batsman goes down and slogs it over mid-wicket. Half a dozen more as it just clears the fence. Was a flat one!"
3404,"FOUR, first boundary for Lynn. Lucky to be still out there though. This was a full length delivery around off, Lynn swings hard at it and gets an inside edge, past the stumps and beats the fielder at short fine leg"
3405,"out Caught by de Villiers!! This was always coming. Lynn never looked in tonight. Struggled a tad initially and throws his wicket away eventually. It's a slower delivery, shortish in length too. The big man goes after it with a single handed shot and gets no sort of connection. Miscues it over mid-off where de Villiers sprints to his left and gulps it down. batsman c de Villiers b bowler 5(8) [4s-1]"
3406,"FOUR, you don't bowl full tosses to DK. Not when he's in such form. DK leans forward a touch and belts the leather through covers, blazed away..."
3407,"FOUR, 'please hit-me,' will you? Short and wide delivery, DK rocks back and murders the cut in the gap between backward point and cover-point. See ya later..."
3408,"FOUR, overcorrects and floats one up under DK's eyes, he thumps the drive through extra cover, wowza! What bat speed.."
3409,"SIX, batsman, gee he is some talent! Shimmies down, gets to the pitch of the ball and sends the cherry soaring straight over the sightscreen. Thwackkk"
3410,"out Lbw!! batsman has been given out lbw. He reviews after a brief contemplation with his skipper. Legal delivery. Nothing on the UltraEdge which means no bat involved. Waiting for ball-tracking... batsman though isn't waiting for anyone. He keeps walking back to the pavilion and rightly so. Umpire's call on hitting clubbed with a couple of reds. team won't lose the review, but they lose batsman. Cleverly bowled by Sundar there. Went wide of the crease and bowled the slider on a goodish length, beat Rana on the sweep and pinged him in line with middle stump. Looked rather close to the naked eye, but technology always finds ways to surprise us. Just brushing the top of leg peg according to HawkEye. batsman lbw b bowler 34(25) [4s-2 6s-2]"
3411,"FOUR, pressure? What's the spelling of that word? This guy seems to have exactly that sort of attitude. Gallops down the pitch, doesn't matter who's bowling, stamps his authority with a rollicking thump over mid-on. Came off the cue end, but he's got it under control with strong bottom hand power"
3412,"out Caught by de Kock!! team review: batsman pulled and seemed to have missed it IMO, but the opinion that matters is that of the TV umpire. So, let's wait and go through the process. Legal delivery. QDK wasn't excited after grabbing the ball. Virat Kohli and a couple of ring fielders got excited and the team skipper wasted no time in posing a T-sign to the onfield umpire, and he is absolutely right in doing so. A spike on the UltraEdge and batsman is gone. A very faint one that and hard to spot amidst the fuzzy environment. The decision has been reversed. OUT. This is a classic case of both batsman and bowler refusing to alter their plans. bowler dished out a short ball and made life difficult for batsman by cutting it across him, the angle was always going against him. He ran down the pitch and fed a faint nick on the pull. batsman c de Kock b bowler 6(6) [4s-1]"
3413,"FOUR, length ball in the slot, goodbye! Russell clears his front leg and swats him over mid-wicket, one bounce and over the ropes"
3414,"FOUR, goes full and goes for a journey! There's no-one at deep extra cover, so what does Russell do? Manufactures ample room and lifts Umesh Yadav over extra cover, the timing on the shot takes care of the rest"
3415,"SIX, conceded 12 runs in his first 3 overs and now 15. T20 things! A candyfloss on middle and leg-stump, Russell muscles it many-a-mile over wide long-on for a maximum"
3416,"out Caught by de Villiers!! Terrific catch from AB running back. Avoided a massive collison with B-Mac there. It was bowled full and wide, asking Russell to fetch from that far, he goes after it and clubs it high into the night sky. AB from extra cover runs back, keeps his eyes on the ball and completes a splendid catch running back. B-Mac was charging from long-on, but he did well to stay low and dive to avoid bombarding into AB. batsman c de Villiers b bowler 15(11) [4s-2 6s-1]"
3417,"FOUR, errs in line this time, short and angling into the body, DK rolls his wrists and nails the pull through mid-wicket"
3418,"1 run, dropped! Washington Sundar at deep cover. VK slapped this length ball over cover, Sundar came running in and seemed to have judged well to snaffle the ball under his throat, but just as he rolled over to avoid the tumble, the ball slipped out of his grasp. Unlucky!"
3419,"FOUR, clears his front leg and lays the finishing marker on the game. AB at mid-on slides to his left, but realizes that's too far to fetch. So, Dinesh Karthik and team start off their campaign in style, a morale-boosting 4-wicket win over team. A typical slog from batsman, all he needed to do was clear mid-off and boy did he hit that hard! Comfortably past mid-on"
3420,"SIX, excellent shot to end the over. He can do this, doesn't matter if Lynn is back to the pavilion. Gets sight of the loopy delivery, sets under it and smokes it right over the bowler's head. In fact a tad to his left, but it's a clean strike. Long-on is a mere spectator"
3421,"SIX, raining sixes already, we are already in the fourth over. This is the third six of the innings. It's a slower delivery by bowler, batsman waits for it calmly and bludgeons it right over long-on. Off to a flier is Sunil"
3422,"FOUR, no stopping him, it seems. Short of a length and outside off, batsman slaps hard and evades the fielder at cover-point. He's in the zone folks!"
3423,"FOUR, beats the chasing team skipper this time around. It's a lightning quick outfield, just look at it. Even the fast moving feet of Kohli can't stop this. Fullish in length around off and batsman creams it through covers. The ball's lost, somewhere under the covers."
3424,"SIX, 20 runs off the over! This is boom boom Sunil batsman. Gets hold of the slower delivery yet again, it's slower in pace too. Plenty of time for the entertainer to camp back and clobber it over mid-wicket. The crowd has gone berserk"
3425,"FOUR, he's taking down team single handedly, is he? Remember he scored the fastest IPL fifty against the same opposition last year (a record that was broken by a manic Rahul earlier today). Comes down the wicket and slaughters this one past mid-off"
3426,"SIX, toying with the bowler, toying with his lines, toying with his lengths. This is a full toss and batsman simply dances down the wicket and wallops it over long-off. Six more! Can't hear anything, the crowd is loving it and so is batsman"
3427,"SIX, that's caught, but the fielder has touched the fence in the momentum. batsman whipped this gift to mid-wicket where Mandeep caught it but at the same time was in contact with the cushions. Needs only one more to complete a fifty"
3428,"1 run, 50 off 17 balls! Can you believe it? He has done it again. He's making a habit of it. Charges down the wicket and whips the floated delivery to deep mid-wicket. Reaches the milestone and raises the bat, acknowledges the crowd!"
3429,"out Bowled!! Umesh Yadav strikes. It's the ex-Knight Rider who gets his former team mate. Bowls a low full toss outside off and that's enough for Umesh to get him a wicket. batsman goes ahead with his drive and ends up getting an inside edge on to the sticks. Entertaining knock, neverthess. Some breather for the Challengers! batsman b bowler 50(19) [4s-4 6s-5]"
3430,"SIX, crack made the sound, there! Shortish in length, Rana has had enough of those. Rocks back and pulls this nicely into the night sky, high and handsome, over mid-wicket for a biggie"
3431,"FOUR, full and wide outside off, Rana plays this one with only one hand, it came off as he threw his hand at it, ends up slicing it past third man to find the fence"
3432,"out Caught by Brendon McCullum!! Umesh is making a huge impact on this game. Has got two big wickets so far and is looking good to get a few more, believe me. Bowls a short and quick delivery around off, batsman who was committed into the shot goes ahead with it. Slaps it horizontally and gets a top-edge. McCullum at point has all the time in the world to settle under the skier and take it. batsman c Brendon McCullum b bowler 13(12) [6s-1]"
3433,"FOUR, that was timed to perfection. Short of a length around off, Rana stands tall and chips this over mid-on. High elbows and poses for the camera. Not to forget the effort by AB though, sprinted back, kept his eyes on the ball and almost pulled it off"
3434,"FOUR, that's not the start Karthik would have wanted from a senior pro. A classic case of nerves from the opening bowler because it is not all that easy to control the new ball immediately. Bowls a freebie length ball down the leg-side and McCullum gleefully flicks the ball behind square past the man at 45"
3435,"SIX, top edgeeee, but fine leg is inside the ring. Wouldn't have mattered though because it cleared the rope. Shortish from bowler, McCullum goes for the pull and gets a thick edge, the bat swing is hard enough for the ball to have enough legs"
3436,"FOUR, turns out to be a really poor over from bowler, didn't bowl to the field. He bowls another one down the leg-side and you can't do that with fine leg inside the line. McCullum calmly waits and flicks the ball through square leg. Great start for team, 14 off the over"
3437,"FOUR, that's a friendly flighted delivery full and outside off stump, batsman leans forward and doesn't over-hit the ball, drives nicely along the ground and hits the gap at cover. The ball escapes past the diving fielder"
3438,"out Caught by Vinay Kumar!! That's a soft dismissal and bowler blows a kiss to the batsman on his way to the dressing room. In trying to fetch another boundary, batsman goes for the fancy looking reverse sweep and completely mistimes it. Get a top edge and it flies slowly to short third man. A great opportunity wasted by batsman. batsman c Vinay Kumar b bowler 4(4) [4s-1]"
3439,"SIX, dances down the pitch and threatens the cameraman on one of those tiers. Flighted delivery on the stumps, batsman got to the pitch of the ball and launches that over long-on. AB batsman has nicely warmed up"
3440,"SIX, this is what he does so well. Those small movements in the crease before the bowler delivers and that puts many bowlers off. This time he backed away and bowler followed him, batsman swept that high in the air and all the way over deep backward square leg"
3441,"FOUR, he's so good with those cover-drives. Full delivery outside off stump, batsman waits and lofts the drive over the infield and the timing was great"
3442,"no run, appeal for caught behind and he's been given. AB reviews immediately. He checks with the umpire about what the decision was for. The umpire informs him he's given him caught behind. There was a noise as the ball passed the bat, but clearly the ball just touched the flap of the pad and was nowhere close to the bat or glove. It was a short of length delivery outside off stump, batsman tried to guide that to third man and missed. DRS saves batsman"
3443,"FOUR, dismissed to the boundary by AB. Short of length, bounces only as high as the chest and the pull shot is swatted away backward of square"
3444,"SIX, launcheddddd! AB in this form... wow. Fullish off-cutter outside off, batsman sizes it up and biffs it over mid-off. Sails into the stands"
3445,"SIX, those wrists have carried this all the way for six. Magnificent timing. He wasn't to the pitch of it even after stepping out, but still went through with the flick over mid-wicket. Plenty of height on it, and enough distance too"
3446,"SIX, oh don't do that. Never do that. A half-tracker to batsman who chews it up and spits it over mid-wicket"
3447,"out Caught by Johnson!! What do you know, he's bowled another short ball and has got the dangerous AB. Massive break for the team. Probably it wasn't as short as AB thought. He went back to pull and ended up skying it off a thick top-edge. Johnson takes it nonchalantly at deep mid-wicket. batsman c Johnson b bowler 44(23) [4s-1 6s-5]"
3448,out Bowled!! The part-timer gets AB de Villiers and Virat batsman in consecutive balls. Floats a seam-up yorker which slips under batsman's bat and rattles the stumps. Rana is pumped as he punches the air in delight. He'll be telling his grandchildren about this. batsman b bowler 31(33) [4s-1 6s-1]
3449,"FOUR, shuffles across, bends on one knee and gets the sweep away fine. Races away once it beats the man"
3450,"FOUR, poor from bowler. Drops it very short, and then turns it into leg-stump. batsman is able to free his arms on the pull as he whacks it to the long leg boundary"
3451,"1 run, fires this carrom ball on a back of length outside off, batsman pats it wide of cover. He was struggling on the single there, would have been gone with a direct-hit"
3452,"FOUR, the two off-breaks he's bowled in this over have both drifted down leg. Unlike the previous one though, batsman just helps this on its away and gets it fine enough to beat short fine leg"
3453,"out Caught by Rinku Singh!! Sarfaraz looks to break free, but holes out at long-on. He was getting stuck out there, so wanted to release the pressure with a big shot. It was a full ball, probably a cutter, but Sarfaraz's bat twists in his hands as he swings down the ground. He miscues it off the inside half straight to long-on, who catches it at the edge of the ropes. batsman c Rinku Singh b bowler 6(10)"
3454,"FOUR, full ball outside off, batsman flings his hands at it and carves it through backward point. It goes to the fence like a bullet"
3455,"SIX, full in the slot, batsman gets in position by clearing his front leg and then wallops it over wide long-on with a clean swing. Ordinary delivery from Vinay"
3456,"FOUR, now a full toss on the pads, whipped away over backward square leg. He's missed his lengths with the first two balls, and at his pace, he will disappear - as he has"
3457,"SIX, six more. 16 off the first 3 balls. batsman is taking serious toll of what is some very ordinary death bowling. Short of length delivery, neither here nor there. batsman camps back and bludgeons the pull away"
3458,"out Caught by Kuldeep Yadav!! Better plans from bowler with these last couple of deliveries. He's gone back to round the wicket and bowled this pretty wide outside off. batsman has to stretch out to reach it, and as he does, the timing is not the same. He slices this up into the accepting hands of sweeper cover. batsman c Kuldeep Yadav b bowler 37(18) [4s-4 6s-2]"
3459,"out Caught by A Russell!! This has gone high, not long. Russell pedals back from extra-cover, and takes a really good catch falling backwards. Good finish to the over from Kumar. Another full and wide delivery which is skied off the toe-end by batsman. batsman c A Russell b bowler 5(5) [4s-1]"
3460,"FOUR, this time he cuts well and gets it in the gap between cover-point and backward point. The length was just short enough for McCullum to rock back and execute the shot"
3461,"FOUR, that's completely mistimed, yet McCullum will get a boundary, this game is so cruel for the bowlers. Flighted googly outside off stump, McCullum wanted to loft that over long-on, but got it on the outside half of the bat, cleared mid-off and it ran away for four"
3462,"SIX, advances and lofts the ball, the timing is good enough and the ball clears the long-on fence quite comfortably. It was the googly from bowler but McCullum read it"
3463,"FOUR, oh he's bludgeoned this very hard. Full and outside off stump, McCullum slices the ball hard and gets it in the gap at cover-point, the fielder in the deep had no chance"
3464,"FOUR, the slower ball but it's been whacked by McCullum. This is a true surface in terms of bounce, so you can hit through the line, McCullum hits that over wide mid-off and it runs away for four"
3465,"out Bowled!! It's turned and gone through the gate. Came slower than McCullum expected and he was through his pull shot early. Short and turning back in, McCullum targeted the mid-wicket boundary, but lost his sticks. Anyway, has done his job as an opener in his first outing for team. batsman b bowler 43(27) [4s-6 6s-2]"
3466,"SIX, that's not a bad ball at all from bowler. Not easy to time the away spinning ball. So bowler bowls one full googly outside off stump, batsman goes for the loft over cover, slices it but the timing it good enough to clear the fence"
3467,"FOUR, half-volley on middle and leg, batsman eases it away with a nonchalant whip off the pads in front of deep square leg for four. Blazes away..."
3468,"out batsman Run Out!! Oh, that looks out! They've gone up to the third umpire, but I think he's as dead as a dodo. A fullish one outside off, push-driven to mid-off where the cat-like Williamson runs in and scores a direct-hit at the non-striker's end. Short nods at Rahane, but not in a reassuring way. Nope, the other thing. Death knell for D'Arcy. And that's Williamson for you, after a few blinders in whites a few weeks ago. The aggression comes from within. batsman run out (Williamson) 4(4) [4s-1]"
3469,"FOUR, lovely, batsman picked this one though, the attempted wrong'un, batsman gets a big stride forward, gets close to the ball and lifts it over cover, couple of bounces and over the ropes"
3470,"FOUR, nicely played by batsman, fraction short and just outside off, the leg-break from Rashid, batsman waits on it, opens the face of the bat at the last moment and dabs it past KW at first slip, rolls away to the fence in a hurry"
3471,"1 run, appeal for LBW and team want a review. Kaul was convinced and he forced his captain to go for it. It's a fair delivery, it's pad first, but I reckon that the impact was outside off, at best it could be umpire's call. Hawk-Eye in and the impact is well outside off, NOT OUT is the call. team lose their review, on a good length and shaping back in, batsman got across his stumps as he defended, the ball clipped the flap oif the bat before deflecting towards mid-off"
3472,"out Caught by Manish Pandey!! That's a soft dismissal, the pressure of getting quick runs does batsman in. He came down the track to a floater outside off, perhaps would have served him better had he gone down the ground, instead, he was looking to drag it wide of long-on, hits it a lot straighter and down the throat of Manish, who ran in from long-on. batsman c Manish Pandey b bowler 17(15) [4s-2]"
3473,"out Caught by Rashid Khan!! The wheels are falling off, both the set batsmen have been dismissed, this is a smart catch from Rashid at deep cover, runs in, slides forward and takes a good catch - right in front of his chest. Nice bit of bowling from bowler, threw this one slower and wider of off, batsman jumped down the track, was looking to go over extra-cover, ended up chipping it high and towards deep cover. Rashid does the rest and team have lost half their side. batsman c Rashid Khan b bowler 49(42) [4s-5]"
3474,"out Caught by Saha!! The Royals are falling away in Uppal. Exceptional bowling from Kaul, banged in short and at batsman, he had nowhere to go as he fended rather awkwardly. The ball ballooned off his gloves, popped straight up and it's an easy catch for Saha. The umpire wants to check for the front-foot no-ball, but Kaul is just about fine on that count. A duck on his IPL debut for batsman. batsman c Saha b bowler 0(2)"
3475,"FOUR, lovely shot, Gopal is a top all-rounder for Karnataka and this shot just certifies it, read the leg-break, opens the face of the bat, used the pace on the ball and ran it past the lone slip"
3476,"FOUR, crunched, lovely cricket from Gopal, on a good length and just outside off, Gopal wasn't fully forward as he drove, the timing is sweet and the ball beats the fielder in the deep at cover"
3477,"out Bowled!! That's that for batsman, he was very circumscept, but the finishing touches never came. The leg-break from Rashid, skids through after pitching, batsman was cramped for room on the pull, went through with the shot, the ball grazed the inside edge and the off-stump is on the floor. The Royals have never got going tonight, the Sunrisers have been all over them. batsman b bowler 6(9)"
3478,"out Caught by Y Pathan!! The extra ball gets bowler a wicket. This was a slower knuckle ball, Gopal had to go for runs, looks to tonk it over long-on, doesn't get anywhere near the middle of the bat and it's a simple catch for Yusuf - right in front of the ropes at long-on. batsman c Y Pathan b bowler 18(18) [4s-2]"
3479,"out batsman Run Out!! 1 run completed. Saha has demolished all the three stumps and I reckon batsman is short of his ground. OUT by a long way. Terrific keeping from Saha, on a good length and well wide of off, batsman sliced the drive behind square on the off-side. He was always coming for the second run, but was too slow in doing so. Pathan was quick on the ball and although his throw was well wide, Saha does well to gather it, turns across and throws down all the three stumps. batsman run out (Y Pathan/Saha) 1(2)"
3480,"FOUR, a bit of outswing on a good length outside off, a hint of seam away, but batsman just check-drives it through the line to sweeper cover for four"
3481,"FOUR, slower one, possibly knuckle, on a length outside off, batsman just picks the perfect moment in time to let leather meet willow with that authoritative whip away to deep mid-wicket for four"
3482,"FOUR, shortens his length as batsman comes down the track, and batsman just adjusts his shot to flat-bat it through deep extra cover for four"
3483,"FOUR, short, no width, batsman arches back into a semi-limbo and scythes that away to the deep backward point fence for four. Expertly done"
3484,"FOUR, length delivery just outside off, straightening a little, and taking the leading edge of the closed bat-face to deep backward point. It was in the air for a while, but through the vacant region for four"
3485,"FOUR, angled in, was that armer, towards leg-stump, batsman came down the wicket, realized he wasn't to the pitch of it, but still went through with the shot Through deep mid-wicket for four"
3486,"out Caught by Rashid Khan!! Excellent catch! Fuller one outside off, batsman gets across and VVSes a lofted whip towards deep mid-wicket where Rashid runs across and takes a commendable sliding catch. He seems surprised that he took that! batsman departs for a run-a-ball 13. batsman c Rashid Khan b bowler 13(13) [4s-2]"
3487,"FOUR, short of length delivery in the channel outside off, batsman tries to open the bat-face and steer it away to third man, gets a thick edge past the keeper, to the long stop fence for four. Oh, if only we had the Saha of the Australia Test series last year..."
3488,"out Caught by Williamson!! Length ball outside off, batsman drags a lofted drive through the line towards long-on where Williamson, for a fleeting moment, nearly fluffs it and you can see the look of pure terror in his eyes. But his cat-like reflexes make sure he latches on during his second attempt. He - is - pumped! batsman c Williamson b bowler 5(8)"
3489,"no run, edged and dropped. ""One of the safest fielders in the slips has dropped a catch"" is the comment from Sanjay Manjrekar on air. Huge moment in the game. Guess who's the culprit? It's skipper Ajinkya Rahane. A simple regulation take - length delivery angled across outside off. batsman aiming to break the dots slashes hard and outside-edges it straight to first slip. Jinks gets both hands but shells it. Kulkarni is in disbelief"
3490,"FOUR, adding salt into the wounds for the Royals. bowler begins with a tripe delivery down leg. Easy pickings for batsman, gets across and whacks it over square leg"
3491,"out Caught by Laughlin!! And bowler strikes. So, batsman's promotion doesn't work for team. Fuller and slanted well outside off, batsman in quest to clear the in-field on the off-side - slices it tamely off the outer half and skies it to mid-off. Safe as houses is Laughlin. One of team's supporters has his hands on his mouth. Just the start team wanted. batsman c Laughlin b bowler 5(5) [4s-1]"
3492,"FOUR, edged and flies over first slip. batsman throws the kitchen sink - comes down the track, gets an outside edge and fortunately for him, it loops over a leaping first slip fielder"
3493,"leg byes, 1 run, not sure what prompted Rahane to take the review. Always seemed like pitching outside leg and the replays confirm it. Loopy and full around leg, batsman missed the sweep and was rapped on the pad. Never looked close at all. Desperation perhaps. The batsmen crossed during the appeal"
3494,"FOUR, kaboooooom! That's been smashed to pulp and it's batsman who has done it. Things that an IPL season does. Even the gracious batsmen look for power. Uses his feet and smacks it hard over the bowler's head. Gopal may have thought about a return catch but there was no time at all to react, chose to wisely save himself"
3495,"FOUR, what a sound off the blade! Gee, he just nailed that one, did batsman. Back of a length and plenty of width outside off, batsman just leant into it and slap-punched on the up. Gets it past a diving mid-off fielder and it speeds away. Considering the form he has been of late and the way he has played today, he is bound to light this IPL up"
3496,"FOUR, that's a freebie from bowler and batsman isn't going to miss out. Not in this carnage mode of his. Stays back and pulls it hard to the deep mid-wicket fence"
3497,"byes, FOUR, that's beaten everyone! For a moment, I thought it was a genuine edge but it wasn't. bowler gets this to spin away from a fuller length and the drastic turn beats batsman's attempted drive. Buttler also fails to react in time and with no slip in place, free runs it is"
3498,"FOUR, crunchy blow to end the game! Shortish and sits up nicely for batsman who rocks back to slam the pull over mid-wicket. Blazed away to the fence and with that, the Sunrisers have stormed to a win in their season opener"
3499,"FOUR, Kulkarni goes short and offers width again, batsman will not miss out on these. Goes deep and bashes it with ferocity through covers"
3500,"SIX, batsman has not been at his best so far today, but this is a shot of highest class. Kulkarni pounds it short for the nth time - well outside off. batsman hops across and upper-cuts. Gets enough bat to send it sailing over the third man fielder"
3501,"FOUR, batsman finds the gap this time. Off the mark with a boundary. bowler keeps it short, just a hint of width and batsman takes toll. Waits back and punches it through cover-point"
3502,"SIX, wow. Dispatched with authority. Supreme pull shot from the Kiwi skipper. Spots the short ball early, camps back and pulls it witheringly into the deep square leg stands"
3503,"FOUR, quality from batsman. No misjudging of the length this time, picks the long hop early and hacks it over square leg. Kind of short-arm jabbed it"
3504,"FOUR, back to back fours for batsman. bowler goes quick and flat outside off, batsman reaches out and slaps it through cover"
3505,"FOUR, batsman is riding his luck. Banged in short on leg-stump, batsman swivels to pull and ends up gloving it over the keeper. Fine leg is squarer and had no chance there"
3506,"FOUR, 50-stand comes up between the duo. Short and width are like oxygen to batsman. Gets on top of the bounce and caresses it through cover-point"
3507,"FOUR, horror start for Gopal. Drags it short first up, ample time for batsman to rock back and pick his spot. Chooses cow corner and dismisses from his sight"
3508,"FOUR, no respect whatsoever for bowler. Is greeted with a boundary. Short with no real venom, batsman goes back and muscles the pull over mid-wicket"
3509,"FOUR, consecutive fours for batsman. bowler sprays it down leg, batsman just gets a tickle on it and sends it very fine. Races away to the fine leg fence"
3510,"FOUR, cracker of a shot! batsman is in top gear and brings up his 29th IPL fifty in some style. Short and wide, he stands tall and spanks it through backward point. Power, timing and placement all in unison"
3511,"FOUR, oh boy, that's top quality stuff! Slower ball from bowler but batsman is in such a mood that he is picking everything. Waits for it and there was width on offer, so just reached out to hammer it through the covers. Rocketed away"
3512,"FOUR, not where he intended to hit that but he'll take it. Another short delivery around off, batsman takes his eyes off the ball and pulls, ends up getting an inside edge past the fielder at short fine leg and finds the fence"
3513,"SIX, this is a fine shot! In the slot on middle and leg, a length delivery and batsman stays put and towers it over long-on for half a dozen, first biggie of the innings"
3514,"FOUR, fine end to the over! Make that 16 runs off the opening over. bowler conceded 14 runs in the previous match off the first over, concedes two extra in this one. It's a back of a length delivery outside off and all batsman does is simply punch it through the gap at cover-point. Into the gap and away to the fence she goes. Just the ideal start for team in this mammoth run chase"
3515,"SIX, Watto is in the house fellas! Gets down on his knee and clubs the floater over mid-wicket, clean as a whistle and it's a maximum"
3516,"1 run, dropped! Tom Curran did a remarkable job of getting to the ball. So, tough to call it a drop. Flighted outside off, batsman sans footwork went for the inside out loft, nowhere near the middle and the ball skied towards deep extra cover. Curran ran forward, dived full length and got fingertips to it"
3517,"SIX, that's what he was trying at the start of the over. batsman remains the key to this chase. Floated up outside off, batsman with a stride forward lofts it handsomely inside out over extra cover, just about manages to clear the rope"
3518,"no run, bowler is a smart operator and he will mix it up. Important to read him from the hand rather the surface. batsman did not pick the off-break and lunged forward to nudge it into the on-side, beaten on the inside edge and struck around the kneeroll. The big press forward helped him there as ball-tracking showed it to be going over"
3519,"out Caught by Vinay Kumar!! The cramp derailed him of the momentum. He was really struggling. Limps off to a quiet stadium. The delivery was short alright and batsman picked the length early, but his feet could not make the adjustment to rock back and the pull was off the top-edge, Vinay ran across to his left from long-on and completed a straightforward catch. Might be a good thing for team as batsman was not able to run as well and we know that Dhoni needs someone to sprint along with him. batsman c Vinay Kumar b bowler 14(12) [6s-1]"
3520,"FOUR, wow! Just a flick of the wrists and Rinku Singh, one of the quick movers, could not get around to stop it. Dances down and gets to the pitch, whipped against the turn to wide long-on, the timing was exquisite"
3521,"FOUR, murdered! That might get him going. Need a boundary off the middle and he's got it. Shimmies down and gets close to the flighted delivery then drills it straight down the ground, went at the rate of knots"
3522,"SIX, outta here! This is what the Chepauk crowd have been waiting for more than two years - batsman at his best. Tossed up on leg-stump, batsman cleared his front leg to give himself a free swing of the arms, sends the ball sailing over the deep mid-wicket fence"
3523,"2 runs, dropped! That should have been taken. Uthappa the culprit. Full and on the stumps, batsman makes room to go over mid-off, does not get the elevation and Uthappa does not time his jump near the edge of the circle. Parries it behind him and Rinku Singh from long-on tidies up"
3524,"SIX, fabulous shot! To get such power behind that shot is incredible. Curran missed his yorker length by an inch or so, batsman stayed on leg-stump and went through with the inside out loft, cleared the fence quite comfortably. Nice hands!"
3525,"SIX, and he ends it with a maximum. Another big over for team, 17 off it. Curran fires in a full toss around the hip, batsman was moving around in the crease, stands still at the point of contact and heaves it flat over deep backward square"
3526,"2 runs, and batsman nudges one into the on-side ring, Dhoni was off in a flash and wanted two, he was cruising for the second when he saw the throw come to his end and decide to charge. Got it comfortably"
3527,"out Caught by Karthik!! batsman walks. Pin drop silence at Chepauk. Is that the match? Well, there is still Bravo - last game's match-winner. batsman waits as the umpire checks for a front foot no-ball, bowler is fine and batsman continues walking. Clever bowling from bowler, slowed it up a touch and kept it outside off, batsman was down on his knee to play the sweep, through the shot early and the under edge is found. Karthik has a juggle before completing the catch. batsman didn't even wait for the umpire. Started walking as soon as he saw the catch taken. batsman c Karthik b bowler 25(28) [4s-1 6s-1]"
3528,"FOUR, much needed boundary for team. It had been a quiet over so far. batsman didn't connect it properly but struck it in the gap, front leg out of the way and a swing of the arms, couple of bounces and into the cow corner fence"
3529,"SIX, geez! Some skill that. He waited and waited, moved right across his stumps when Russell was about to deliver, crouched low and scooped the low full toss all the way over fine leg. The crowd find their voice again"
3530,"SIX, this is spectacular. It was the off-cutter on back of a length, batsman had moved away to the leg-side and was almost cramped for room, extended his arms and lofted it over long-on. It was more of a punch from the Englishman. Reminded me of the Kohli shot against Chris Woakes"
3531,"1 run, fifty for batsman. team needed someone to take over the baton after Raina's wicket and the Kent batsman has taken the onus on himself to keep the chase going. Raises the bat and gets the applause from the yellow faithfuls. Walked across his stumps and Curran fired it in the blockhole, the sweep comes off the under edge and bobbles away to fine leg"
3532,"SIX, batsman is playing a gem here. He is getting the big hit at the right moment. The slower delivery and batsman was waiting for it with a crouched stance, gets underneath it and nails the pull over deep square leg"
3533,"out Caught by Uthappa!! Uthappa pumps his fists. team find a lifeline once again. Full delivery and right in the slot, had batsman stayed put without moving to the leg-side, he could have connected with the loft better, instead he had to reach out and managed only a toe-end to long-off. Uthappa ran across to his left to pouch that. Nevertheless, batsman has given team a chance to pull this off and Chepauk might have found a new hero in him. batsman c Uthappa b bowler 56(23) [4s-2 6s-5]"
3534,"no ball, SIX, terrible terrible start from bowler. team owner Shah Rukh Khan affords a smile. A high full toss well above the waist, Bravo somehow managed to swing it away off the top-edge and over fine leg. What a start to the over!"
3535,"SIX, the roof has come down at Chepauk. batsman seals the win with a mighty six. Did I say he's not connecting 'em well? He's just nailed this one. The slower delivery, off-cutter from Vinay, right in the arc for batsman, who waits before teeing off, full swing of the arms and the ball sails over the long-on fence"
3536,"FOUR, poor delivery by Dre Russ. Gifts a full toss to batsman who clips it nonchalantly past the fielder at short fine leg, easy pickings for the batsman there"
3537,"SIX, excellent use of the feet by batsman. Tossed up delivery on middle and batsman shimmies down the wicket to pump it over the bowler's head for a biggie, that came right off the meat and met the sightscreen on the full"
3538,"SIX, carnage continues! The crowd is loving this. Flighted delivery around off, batsman stands tall and chips it with ease right over covers, half a dozen more. These two are looking unstoppable"
3539,"FOUR, 50 up for team! team, team are the chants at the stadium. Short of a length outside off, batsman camps back and cuts it past the diving fielder at cover-point to add four more to the tally"
3540,"FOUR, cheeky there. Short of a length outside off, batsman arches back and guides it smartly towards third man, very fine and you can't keep a fielder there"
3541,"FOUR, the newbie to IPL is welcomed in style by batsman. It's short again and looking at the kind of touch batsman is in he won't spare you. Pulls it nicely over mid-wicket, one bounce and into the fence she goes"
3542,"SIX, this is entertainment. Full length delivery around off, batsman keeps his head still and powers it over long-off for six more, the bowler is under pressure, straightaway"
3543,"out Caught by Rinku Singh!! Maiden wicket for bowler in IPL. A breather for team there. Short of a length delivery around off and batsman pulls it hard again. But there's a fielder in the deep, it's Rinku Singh out there. He moves to his left and grabs it eventually to bring an end to batsman's blitzkrieg. team couldn't have asked for a better start from the Aussie all-rounder. Wait on.. the crowd at Chepauk welcomes Raina with a loud cheer. The highest run scorer for team in history of IPL is at the crease. batsman c Rinku Singh b bowler 42(19) [4s-3 6s-3]"
3544,"out Caught by (sub)Shivam Mavi!! Both the set openers are back in the hut now. That was bowled outside off and was spinning away from the batsman, batsman goes ahead with his chip shot and times it straight to the subsitute fielder who comes running in and takes it. Are team getting back in this match? With two new batsmen at the crease getting those odd boundaries might get a bit difficult. batsman c (sub)Shivam Mavi b bowler 39(26) [4s-3 6s-2]"
3545,"FOUR, batsman is underway! Typical Lynn. Shortish ball with width on offer, he'll punish you everytime. Stands tall and slashes it over point. Raced away and there's pin drop silence"
3546,"SIX, batsman is off the mark with a six. I'm not surprised. Swings his bat hard and takes on the man at long-on. The fielder is made to look like a spectator. It was a length ball, batsman stood tall and thumped it well over the fielder. Hello Chennai"
3547,"SIX, wow! Six more and that's 18 off the opening over. Slightly fuller and got it to swing in a tad did bowler. But, that doesn't bother batsman. He slightly backs away and clobbers it over cow corner"
3548,"out Caught by Raina!! The ploy to bring the spinner has worked straightaway. So, batsman is gone! A dot, six, six and OUT. Good ball that from bowler. A nicely tossed up delivery above the eyeline of the batsman wide of off. batsman looks to slog it over mid-wicket from there and all he manages is a top-edge, that goes miles up in the air. Raina sprinted to his left from cover and took a sharp running catch. Tumbles on the ground, but ensured that the ball didn't pop out of his hand. batsman c Raina b bowler 12(4) [6s-2]"
3549,"1 run, flat and shortish ball, Lynn stays deep in his crease and pulls it powerfully. He would have thought that a boundary was there for the taking. But, there was Chahar at square leg, who flew full length to his left and could only get a hand on it. It will be too harsh to call that as a drop, he got both hands though, perhaps had a chance to cling on"
3550,"out Caught by Dwayne Bravo!! There's the jig from DJ. team fans will start practicing that. team lose their fifth wicket, with 10 overs still left. It was hurled fuller outside off and batsman goes hard on the drive. The bat turned at the point of impact and he ended up slicing it to backward point off the bottom part of the bat. Bravo won't drop those. batsman c Dwayne Bravo b bowler 2(4)"
3551,"FOUR, team will remain positive, batsman brings out the reverse sweep with a slip in place, doesn't get hold of the shot, but has enough to get it past the fielder"
3552,"FOUR, lovely shot, a long half-volley from bowler, full and just outside off, Russell stays in his crease and drills it through extra-cover, no need to run for those"
3553,"SIX, clubbed, length ball from Bravo and Russell sends it into the long-on stands. Gets a big stride forward, didn't get hold of the shot, but his power takes the ball miles over the man at long-on"
3554,"SIX, that's a bad mishit and it has still gone deep into the stands at long-off. On a good length and well outside off, this was the kuckle ball from Thakur, Russell was looking to smash it over long-on, ended up slicing it high and way over long-off for a maximum"
3555,"SIX, back-to-back sixes, Russell is on a roll now, low full-toss from Thakur, he missed out on the yorker, but Russell didn't, clears his left leg and clouts it high and over long-on"
3556,"SIX, massive and that has gone out of Chepauk. This ball will not come back, Bravo missed his yorker by an inch, turned out to be a perfect length ball, Russell cleared his left leg and swings it high and over long-on. 105m is the distance"
3557,"SIX, this is turning out to be a serious hammering from Russell, this was a slower full-toss, Russell bends down low and then heaves it high and over wide long-on for another maximum"
3558,"SIX, cracking shot, huge over for team, this was another slower ball and DK picked the bones off it. Gets well forward, uses his wrists to good effect and whips it high and wide of long-on. More problems for MS and team"
3559,"SIX, just over Rayudu at deep cover and that's fifty for Russell, could Rayudu been further back, would have had a better chance at catching it. This was full and well outside off, Russell got down on one knee and sliced it powerfully over cover. Rayudu ran across from the deep, puts in the leap and only palmed it over the ropes"
3560,"out Lbw!! batsman has been given OUT LBW. He talks with Russell and reviews it. Was it slipping down the leg-side? Don't think there's any bat on that, struck DK in front of leg-stump, but he's so back that the ball didn't have far to travel. Umpire's call on Hawk-Eye and batsman is OUT. A handy knock from batsman comes to an end, lovely yorker from bowler, followed batsman slightly and struck him bang in front of leg-stump, it was the back-pad as well. The impact was in front of leg and would have been clipping the stumps. batsman lbw b bowler 26(25) [4s-2 6s-1]"
3561,"SIX, the sixes keep flowing from the bat of Russell, length ball on his pads, he was backing away and flicks it nonchalantly over mid-wicket, sails over the head of the man in the deep"
3562,"SIX, back-to-back sixes, Bravo is getting a real pasting in Chepauk. This was the slower ball and Russell spotted it early, gets down low and smashes it high and way over long-on, gets to his highest score in IPL"
3563,"SIX, a hat-trick of sixes for Russell, length ball on the stumps, Russell backs away, clears his front leg and heaves it high and over deep mid-wicket for a maximum"
3564,"SIX, Russell is having a party at the Chepauk, on a good length and well wide of off, he bends down low and drills it high and over cover for another maximum, his 10th six of the innings"
3565,"FOUR, that's been thrashed through extra cover. A fuller length ball, stand-and-deliver stuff from Lynn. Stood tall and hammered the drive between extra cover and mid-off"
3566,"FOUR, easy pickings for batsman! Full and straying on the pads, a lean across followed by a nonchalant flick over backward square leg. One bounce and into the fence"
3567,"FOUR, steered and just wide of the Raina at wide slip. A short of length delivery with width on offer, batsman opens his bat-face at the last moment and guided it to Raina's right, who dived full length. Trickles away to the fence"
3568,"SIX, smacked, 11th six for Russell and team finish with 202 on the board. A slower length ball outside off, Russell bends down low and smashes it high and over long-off for a maximum"
3569,"FOUR, 'catch it' cries bowler, but Lynn has got enough wood on that. bowler saw the batter back away and fired on following him. Lynn toe-ends the drill over and wide of mid-off. Uppish, but safe"
3570,"SIX, that's a wonderful shot! Was darted in by bowler, batsman spotted it quickly. Got down on a knee and slogged it over deep mid-wicket with a sweep shot. Off she goes into the stands and thereby silencing the crowd"
3571,"FOUR, another quick delivery, but errs in line, Lynn moves across, crouches and helps it along its way. Manages to beat short fine leg and there's no one to stop that. Not to forget, a poor effort from Harbhajan who dived over the ball at short fine"
3572,"out Bowled!! You miss, I hit! team needed this and Chepauk finds its voice. Flat ball lasered in on the stumps at 92kph, Lynn comes down the track and is beaten in the trajectory. Looked to hack across the line and the ball just sneaked through the gap between bat and pad. Crashes into the leg pole. batsman b bowler 22(16) [4s-4]"
3573,"SIX, batsman is in good touch! Not much flight on this ball, batsman spots it, gets underneath it and lofts it over wide long-on. Right off the meet of the bat"
3574,"SIX, batsman is turning it on here. This was bowled slightly outside off, doesn't matter to batsman. He crouches slightly low and clouts it over long-on. He's timing it brilliantly. Time to target him with pace?"
3575,"FOUR, superbly played! Trifle short and Rana was quick to go on the back foot and pounce on it. Waited for the ball and scythed it through backward point. The man in the deep gives a chase, but to no avail"
3576,"FOUR, ""that's not how you follow it up,"" says Ian Bishop on air. After bowling a good bumper, Thakur now bowls a fullish ball, Rana stays in his crease and hit it through the line. Lofted over wide mid-off and there is no one to stop that"
3577,"out Caught by Dhoni!! Dhoni pouches, up goes the umpire's finger and there's the roar from the Chepauk crowd. A soft dismissal. An innocuous short of length delivery on middle and leg, Rana moved across to help it along its way. Gets a faint under-edge onto his thigh and the ball lobs up in the air. MS moves to his right to snaffle that. A straightforward catch for the captain. batsman c Dhoni b bowler 16(14) [4s-2]"
3578,"out batsman Run Out!! team have gifted away a wicket here. Bad communication between two senior members. Length ball around off and batsman punched it towards cover from the crease. Raina stopped it with a dive with his left hand, picks the ball and hits the bullseye at the bowler's end. batsman was ball-watching and Karthik was halfway down. One had to go at the danger's end, and batsman went for it. This is a big wicket. Raina has his arms aloft. batsman run out (Raina) 29(16) [4s-2 6s-3]"
3579,"FOUR, cracking shot. Should settle batsman's nerves, if any. Shortish ball wide of off, batsman gets on top of it and cuts it fiercely through the off-side, beating the man at backward point"
3580,"out Munro Run Out!! The shortish ball skidded on and the batsman trying to pull, gets hit on the pads for the ball to roll away into the on-side. Munro wanted a steal but was sent back. The keeper ran to his left, picked it up and threw it to the bowler, who whipped off the bails. Dreadful start for Delhi. Munro run out (Buttler/bowler) 0(0)"
3581,"FOUR, spanked! Murdered! Four.. That was a little shimmy and a powerful blade smacking it down the ground"
3582,"FOUR, kneels down and punishes it away. Gets it past the man at short fine leg and the ball races away between square leg and short fine leg for a four. Very well done. He preempted the angle and got it away"
3583,"FOUR, lucky, batsman ain't complaining. The batsman goes for the big wild swing. The ball trims the outer half of the bat and flies over the man at short third man for a four"
3584,"SIX, finally, oh, finally, the wait is over. Here is the BIG SHOW!! The ball was in the zone and the batsman stayed his crease to use the long handle. The batsman again dragged the ball away and this time well over long-on"
3585,"FOUR, that is sworded away! Full and wide, throws his bat at the leather whilst losing his balance and smears the ball over point for a four. That will do for DD. 14 of the over and that is exactly what they need in each of the rest three overs"
3586,"out Caught by Buttler!! Looks to swing hard and is gone. He was never in today. The bowler cut his fingers over the ball and that tricked the batsman, who was early into his stroke. A thick edge and the keeper did the rest. batsman was again trying to drag it away into the on-side and lost shape completely trying to strike it hard. DD looking down the barrell. batsman c Buttler b bowler 17(12) [4s-2 6s-1]"
3587,"FOUR, full, little wide, the batsman opens the face of the blade and beats the man at deepish point. Much needed four but they need more. Good, intelligent batting from batsman. 30 off 10 balls"
3588,"FOUR, length slower delivery and the batsman pulls the ball away. Did not time it but gave it some good air miles. Once it landed, there was no one and it went into the fence"
3589,"out Caught by Gowtham!! The fielder takes a good one behind square on the leg-side. It's a full ball and the batsman never got really under it. Got more altitude than distance -- as batsman has today on more than one occasion -- and Gowtham charged in from the deep to take it. Good catch actually, flinging his body in front and plucking it above the ground. More importantly it is a dot ball. That might well have been another delivery where bowler ran his fingers on the ball. batsman c Gowtham b bowler 20(14) [4s-3]"
3590,"out Caught by Stokes!! Another skier, another good take. The fielder at long-on came in running in and took it. The length ball was another swirler. The ball sliced up from the outer half of the blade and the fielder did the rest. batsman c Stokes b bowler 3(3)"
3591,"FOUR, throws his hands at it and slices it flat-footed over covers. It's all but over...."
3592,"SIX, A six to finish. Does not matter. 9th successive win for team in Jaipur and 7th successive win against DD. The rains might have done them a favour. That was full and the batsman clobbered it down the ground by holding his shape nicely to send it over long-on. team win this 10 runs"
3593,"FOUR, poor ball to start! Drags it short and it's the slider as well, width on offer for Short who smacks the back foot punch through the covers. Easy pickings"
3594,"out batsman Run Out!! 1 run completed. Mix up and batsman is run out yet again! Holy Molly, what's with the running between these two? Waste of a wicket really but the Daredevils won't mind it at all. It was a drifter into middle and leg, Short nudged it towards deep mid-wicket and took the first run with ease. Crazy mix up on the second run and he went for it eventually but Vijay Shankar was alert. The direct hit at the keeper's end caught the southpaw well short. batsman run out (Vijay Shankar) 6(3) [4s-1]"
3595,"out Bowled!! Oh no! Unfortunate! Tossed up temptingly on middle, angling in from round the wicket, batsman gets forward and tries to go through with the slog-sweep to negate the spin, ends up getting an inside edge onto his thigh, which then ricochets onto the off-stump. On another night, it might have missed the wickets, but the stars up above aren't aligned for him tonight. batsman b bowler 37(22) [4s-2 6s-2]"
3596,"FOUR, master of manipulating the field. There's a leg slip now instead of silly point, and the tossed up one on off is reverse-lapped to third man for four"
3597,"FOUR, that flat-batted swipe coming down the track to a length ball. Made room, slapped it inside out to deep extra cover for four past a diving cover. He's absolutely leathered that"
3598,"FOUR, short outside off, batsman drags it towards the on-side with a clouted pull to deep mid-wicket for four. Boult made a lot of room, running across a few yards and diving in front, and nearly pulled off a screamer but the ball flicks his thumb and ricochets away into the fence"
3599,"out Caught by Chris Morris!! No no no! What are you doing Jinx? Not too short, no turn, but a little too quick and skiddy. batsman is stuck between and pull and a flick with a bit of a swat and gets a leading edge towards Morris at point to hand him a mango dolly. batsman c Chris Morris b bowler 45(40) [4s-5]"
3600,"SIX, length ball angling into middle, batsman lays into that slog-sweep on the up and sends that into the deep mid-wicket orbit for six! Boult takes a phenomenal catch there -- leaping and reverse-cupped -- but the momentum has him going over the ropes"
3601,"SIX, length delivery outside off, batsman puts his body-weight behind it and lofts that into the night sky, Maxwell at long-on tries to take that. Jumps sideways -- in an awkward enough shape already -- and ends up dropping it into the boundary. Think that was a six even if he had taken it; Maxwell was air-borne and well beyond the ropes. Unfortunate, because that was a good effort, but that's another six"
3602,"FOUR, short-ish and wide, batsman slashes and slashes hard, as that blazes away in front of third man for four. The spin on that shows you how hard he sliced that..."
3603,"SIX, fuller one on off, batsman gets low, makes room and throws his hands at that to loft that over long-off for six. Massive hit. Great start to the over for batsman. A bit of a slice, but with these kalyug bats, the meat is much bigger"
3604,"out Bowled!! Off-cutter/yorker combo, not an easy one to get right, especially under duress, on middle, batsman gets across to lap/ramp it away towards fine leg, misses it completely as the bails light up - and so do bowler's eyes. Brilliant delivery under pressure. batsman b bowler 29(18) [4s-2 6s-2]"
3605,"FOUR, whackkkkkkkkkk! batsman has had enough of proding around. Charges down the track and makes room before blasting this wide of the man at mid-off. Races away to the fence in no time"
3606,"SIX, kaboooooom! He's got this off the meat, that's for sure. Fractionally short from Morris and batsman doesn't even bother to go on the back foot. Was on the initial forward trigger and picks up the pull with ease. Into the shorter boundary at deep square leg for a biggie"
3607,"out Caught by Pant!! What a ripper! The decision to persist with bowler has paid dividends for Gambhir. Good aggressive captaincy. But what a ball though! Phew! One of those jaffas that you get in Test cricket generally and batsman must be wondering where it came from. Angled into him from a good length and shaped away with a spit of extra bounce. Unplayable by any means and it flies off the outside edge. Pant reacted sharply too and flung himself to his left to take a good diving catch. What a huge wicket this is! team are jolted early. batsman was looking to up the ante, has to depart. batsman c Pant b bowler 16(12) [4s-1 6s-1]"
3608,"FOUR, sheer class! batsman had some runs in the last game and hence, is in a good space mentally. Gets a full ball that's not all that wide but batsman got a nice stride forward and eased the square drive through point. The timing was fab"
3609,"SIX, cracking shot! batsman isn't wasting any time to get going and is happy to target the red-hot bowler who is breathing fire. Short ball that's not high enough, sits up nicely for batsman who dismisses it over mid-wicket with a forehand smash sort of pull. Beautifully done"
3610,"FOUR, just short of backward square leg! For a moment, the fielder in the ring thought he had a chance but it bounced in front of him and sneaked through. Once it got past him, the outfield did the rest. Short of a length ball that batsman pulled without bothering to keep it down. Fortunate that it didn't go to hand"
3611,"FOUR, freebie to start from bowler and batsman puts it away in style. Half-tracker and it's asking for trouble on this easy-paced surface. batsman swivels on the back foot and controls the pull with elan through backward square leg"
3612,"SIX, half-tracker and goodbye! Cannot bowl such stuff on this pitch, easy for batsman who rocks back in a flash and deposits it into the stands at deep mid-wicket. Huge hit!"
3613,"FOUR, deft touch! If the previous shot showcased his power, this is all about finesse. Slower and around off, not all that short but batsman waits for it on the back foot before essaying the late cut. Gets it very fine and just past the keeper as it races to the fence. He is in the zone, is batsman"
3614,"1 run, tight single but they get it in the end with ease. Slower and outside off, batsman stays back and pats it into the gap at cover. 50-run stand is up!"
3615,"FOUR, rubbish ball and batsman will feast on these all day. Gets a drag on around middle and leg, sits on the back foot and nails the pull through square leg. Found the gap"
3616,"1 run, chance and Hooda has dropped it. That's a massive let-off for batsman, no calling at all, Hooda ran back from mid-wicket, it was perhaps Rashid's catch as he came in from deep mid-wicket. Short of a length and on the stumps, batsman was in no control over the pull, got a fat top-edge that went high and over mid-wicket. Hooda back-pedalled, wasn't in control as he went for the catch, the ball hit his palms and burst out."
3617,"SIX, lovely shot, batsman was in complete control over this pull, banged in short and well outside off, batsman swivelled across and pulled it high and over square leg, went a long way over the ropes"
3618,"FOUR, lovely from batsman, tad fuller and wider of off, batsman leans forward, drives it on the up and finds the gap past cover-point, the timing is sweet and the ball rolls away to the fence"
3619,"FOUR, that is batsman's riposte. The wrong 'un on a fullish and batsman used his reach to good effect, pressed forward and struck it straight back over the bowler, couple of bounces and into the fence"
3620,"FOUR, needless. Kaul brought third man up and batsman sends the ball there. Should have followed the mantra off the first five deliveries. On a length outside off, batsman dabbed it late and beat short third man with ease"
3621,"SIX, into the second tier. Mumbai need to step on the pedal. Bit of air as bowler tossed it wide of off, batsman charged down and had the room to free his arms, smashed it over extra cover for a biggie"
3622,"SIX, wow! That was just an extension of the arms and the ball flies over the fence. For a change bowler goes full, right in batsman's arc, he stays rooted to the crease and presents the full bat face to loft it straight back over the bowler. Held his pose for the shutterbugs"
3623,"FOUR, for the second time batsman uses the pace of bowler to pocket a boundary. Fraction short and outside off, batsman waits in the crease and steers it behind point, Kaul at third man should have done a better job of stopping that. He got there and allowed it to escape past him"
3624,"out Caught by Dhawan!! What was that? batsman puts his hand up in an apologetic manner towards Yadav, I guess. Back of a length delivery, clocked at 143kph, batsman stays back in the crease and is through the shot even before the ball arrived, the ball takes the cue-end and skies to sweeper cover. Dhawan completes the catch and does his thigh slap. batsman was so much early that his bottom hand came off the bat handle as he made contact with the ball. Timely wicket for Hyderabad and not for Mumbai as batsman was looking in ominous form. batsman c Dhawan b bowler 28(23) [4s-3 6s-2]"
3625,"SIX, he remains the key for Mumbai. Flighted on off, Yadav backs away by moving to leg, give himself the opportunity to free his arms and lofted it inside out handsomely over extra cover. Cleared the rope comfortably"
3626,"FOUR, lovely shot! Kaul might have been a bit too predictable with his length, Yadav moved to the leg-side and waited for the short delivery, swatted the pull backward of square leg and ended the over with a much needed boundary"
3627,"FOUR, that is cheeky. Pushed it through did Rashid and batsman used the pace on that, shuffled across with bent knee and scooped it fine, giving short fine leg no chance"
3628,"out Bowled!! Just too good. It is hard enough for a proper batsman to pick Rashid, imagine how hard it would be for an Australian all-rounder. batsman shimmies down the wicket without knowing what delivery it is, the wrong 'un spins in and sneaks past the swinging blade before crashing into the stumps. A well-deserved wicket for Rashid, who has bowled brilliantly without any luck. batsman b bowler 9(9) [4s-1]"
3629,"out Caught by Deepak Hooda!! And another one gone. This knuckle ball epidemic is getting to every Indian pacer. Sharma the latest to show it off. Lands it on a length and Yadav thinking it was a normal length delivery, goes through the line with the loft, miscues it completely and Hooda runs forward from long-on to pouch that. Yadav was the key and even he is sent back. batsman c Deepak Hooda b bowler 28(31) [4s-2 6s-1]"
3630,"out Lbw!! You can't get more plumb LBW decisions than that. Umpire Nandan messed it up. The knuckle ball once again from Sharma, batsman is through his slog early and is struck on the back leg, yes back leg. The ball was crashing into middle stump as per ball-tracking and for some reason Nandan didn't give that out. Sharma was quick to ask KW to take the review and the skipper obliged. batsman lbw b bowler 0(4)"
3631,"out Caught by Shakib!! Smart catch from Shakib and Hooda can breathe easy. On a good length and angling into batsman's pads, he was looking to tuck it towards the on-side, perhaps played a tad too early, the ball looped in the air and was dropping in front of short square leg. Shakib was alert though, dives forward, got both hands underneath and scooped the catch. batsman falls cheaply once again and team have lost an early wicket. batsman c Shakib b bowler 11(10) [4s-1 6s-1]"
3632,"SIX, batsman gets going in some style, his first runs of IPL and it's a huge six, length ball on his pads, he swivelled across and helped it on its way, deep into the second tier at long leg"
3633,"FOUR, streaky and four, Kishan gets lucky and gets a boundary as well, comes down the track, doesn't get anywhere close to the ball, swings through the line, the big inside edge races away past the leg-stump and into the fence"
3634,"FOUR, cheeky! batsman decides to do something about the length Kaul was bowling, moving across the stumps and laps the length delivery over short fine leg, enough legs on that to reach the fence"
3635,"FOUR, edged and four, more runs for Kishan, more frustration for Sandeep. This the slower ball on off, Kishan was perhaps looking to play with an open face, he didn't look to get it that fine though, past the keeper and third man was inside the ring"
3636,"FOUR, short of a good length and well outside off, batsman stands tall and punches with a straight bat, finds the gap past cover-point and the ball rolls away to the fence"
3637,"FOUR, that's his answer to bowler, short of a length and angling across the left-hander, batsman was backing away, has to reach out and carves it over cover, a few bounces and into the fence"
3638,"SIX, magnificent shot, pacy length ball on the stumps, batsman makes room by backing away, swings hard and sends it sailing over extra-cover for a maximum, flat and hard - that's what made team shell big bucks to buy him in the auctions"
3639,"leg byes, FOUR, appeal for LBW, but I reckon it might have pitched outside leg. Kishan was setting himself up for a reverse sweep, lost his poise in doing so, ended up with a reverse hack, the ball clipped the pads and beat the slip fielder to the fence"
3640,"1 run, chance and dropped, Kishan was looking clueless against Rashid, but the bowler has been let-down by his fielder. He didn't spot the wrong 'un as he gave the charge, doesn't get anywhere close to the ball, gets a thick top-edge over cover, Sandeep back pedalled, looked certain to take the catch and then makes a mess of it"
3641,"out Caught by Y Pathan!! Oh dear! This is terrible cricket from Kishan, another blind swing and this time, he isn't reprieved. Yusuf was the fielder in the deep and he takes a good low catch. Coming to the ball, on a good length and angling across the left-hander, Kishan was eyeing the mid-wicket boundary as he hacked across the line, gets a thick edge that flew towards third man. Yusuf was perhaps unsighted by the floodlights, but does well to bend forward and takes it inches off the turf. batsman c Y Pathan b bowler 9(9) [4s-2]"
3642,"FOUR, smashed, half-volley outside off, batsman gets forward and drills it past the non-striker, the fielder at mid-off was a mere spectator"
3643,"out Bowled!! Kaul has two in the over and he's chuffed to bits. He's running all around the ground in jubilation, three wickets in the powerplay for team and all those dropped chances will be forgotten. This was the slower knuckle ball, pitched on middle and shaped across the left-hander, batsman didn't spot it, went for the big heave over mid-wicket, he missed and heard the sound of clatter. batsman b bowler 29(17) [4s-3 6s-2]"
3644,"FOUR, beautifully played, too full and too wide of off, Krunal gets close to the ball, that allows him to play against the turn, beats extra-cover with the drive and rolls away to the fence"
3645,"FOUR, cheeky and four, tossed up well outside off, Krunal bends down low, reverses his stance, uses the pace on the ball and laps it very fine, beats short third man and it's back-to-back boundaries for Krunal"
3646,"out Caught by Williamson!! bowler has his man and team find themselves in further trouble. This was tossed up and held its line just outside off, Krunal was looking to play with the turn, closed the bat-face early and pops a leading edge, straight to KW at cover. It's a dolly and the team captain doesn't need a second invitation. batsman c Williamson b bowler 15(10) [4s-2]"
3647,"FOUR, cracking shot, too short and well outside off, Suryakumar swivels across, rolls his wrists and pulls it in front of square, beats mid-wicket and rolls away to the fence"
3648,"FOUR, batsman is underway! That's bread and butter for Gabbar. Too wide and he'll punish you all day. The length was on the shorter side as well - the recipe to get hit. batsman flashes his bat at it and slaps it through extra cover. Off the mark with a boundary"
3649,"FOUR, second boundary for batsman. didn't try to over-hit, timed it well and the placement was good. The line is too straight from bowler - strayed on the pads and batsman used his wrists to glance it away in front of square on the leg-side. The man inside the 30-yard circle gives a chase, but can only escort the ball to the fence"
3650,"out Caught by Rohit!! Almost a horrible bit of miscommunication between bowler and Rohit, but the Mumbai skipper just about takes it in the end. He can see the funny side now, won't have been so funny had it gone down. But what a horrible shot from Pandey. All team need to do here is knock bowler around, the rate is under control. But Pandey charges out for a big hit. He's done in by the flight, and skies it up off a leading edge. It was bowler's catch, but the youngster leaves it to the skipper without any indication. At the very last moment, Rohit sinks low and snaffles it off the turf. Phew. The 20-year old is inspiring the visitors and keeping them in it. batsman c Rohit b bowler 11(8) [4s-1]"
3651,"FOUR, charges out to the pitch of the ball and smokes it down the ground. What a way to start from Hooda. Wow"
3652,"FOUR, poor delivery from bowler, can't afford to release the pressure this way. team don't have much to play with. Short and wide, batsman sizes it up early and slaps it through point"
3653,"out Bowled!! What a soft, soft dismissal. He had so much time on the back foot, how did he even edge it! Shortish googly from bowler, sits up outside off. batsman is back in the crease to tamely pat it away through point, but all he does is chop it back onto the stumps. What a spell from bowler to give Mumbai hope from a pretty hopeless situation. He's done though, will the others rise? batsman b bowler 12(12) [4s-1]"
3654,"FOUR, pivots on the back leg and whip-pulls this delivery to the left of fine leg. Ordinary short of length delivery from bowler, sitting up comfortably around Pathan's chest to be dispatched"
3655,"FOUR, this has been a really sensible partnership for the most part, and here comes the reward. bowler sprays on the pads, allowing Pathan an easy release of pressure as he glances it away past short fine leg"
3656,"out Caught by Pollard!! team are close, but this is still not over. bowler rushes Pathan with this short of length delivery which hurries onto his attempted pull shot. He was caught on the swivel as it spooned up off the splice, before nestling into the bucket hands of Pollard at mid-wicket. batsman c Pollard b bowler 14(14) [4s-2]"
3657,"out Caught by Ishan Kishan!! Oh my, what do we have here! bowler has ripped the game open once more with two in two. Pacy full ball outside off, the punchy fellow that Rashid is, he goes for an ambitious cover drive but can only nick it to the keeper. Hat-trick ball coming up. batsman c Ishan Kishan b bowler 0(1)"
3658,"out Caught&Bowled!! Taken one-handed. The Mumbai supporters in the crowd erupt. Kaul was probably surprised by the line from bowler here - it was full at the stumps after the previous two which were wide of him. He chips the off-cutter straight back, where bowler sticks a hand out and the ball sticks. This will be some comeback from team if they pull it off. batsman c and b bowler 0(4)"
3659,"out Caught by Krunal Pandya!! Sandeep does in fact look for the boundary. He walks across, bends his back knee and tries for the same scoop that Kedar Jadhav hit for six a few nights back against bowler. But what Sandeep achieves is very different. He doesn't get it anywhere near the middle, and spoons it up to short fine leg. bowler raises his arms as the team fans go wild. batsman c Krunal Pandya b bowler 0(2)"
3660,"SIX, he has clubbed this for six! What a start to the over. Low full toss wide of off from round the wicket, Hooda shuffles across a bit, bends his back knee and frees his arms. Muscles it over long-off"
3661,"FOUR, how good are those wrists? Must have learnt a bit from VVS. Wasn't a bad ball at all from bowler. On a good length and on middle and leg, batsman stayed in his crease and flicked it nonchalantly over and wide of mid-on"
3662,"FOUR, dropped! Cutting is the culprit. An ugly hoick attempted from batsman and he mistimed it horribly. Cutting, at mid-on, went back and got to the ball, but couldn't hold onto it. What's worse? He allows it go for a boundary. It was a good length ball and batsman was slightly late into his shot"
3663,"FOUR, the top-edge goes over the keeper's head and runs away for another boundary. No luck lor bowler, who banged one short and the bal got big on the batsman. batsman, despite not being in a good position, went with the pull shot. He will be happy with the result though"
3664,"FOUR, bowler hurls one fuller and batsman decides to go after it. It was bowled wide of off, batsman comes down for a walk and muscles it over the bowler's head to collect his third boundary"
3665,"no run, was that a chance? batsman backed away and Pandya followed him. Got a bit of turn and batsman missed the cut. The keeper failed to catch it cleanly. Not sure if there was any bat involved"
3666,"FOUR, bowler overpitches and batsman takes heavy toll of it. The back leg is bent, to the pitch and then creamed the cover drive. The placement was spot on too"
3667,"FOUR, 50 up for team! In a quick time. This was a pacy good length ball on middle and leg, batsman helps it along its way to fine leg. Runs coming thick and fast for the hosts"
3668,"FOUR, edged, missed the stumps and races away to the fence. 14 runs off the over. It was a skiddy length ball from round the wicket and batsman checked his cross-batted stroke. The ball trimmed the inside edge, missed the sticks and evaded the keeper to the fine leg fence"
3669,"FOUR, crashed away! The googly from bowler, but it's short and wide outside off. batsman trks back and muscles the cut through extra cover. Lewis sprints across and dives to his left, in vain"
3670,"out Lbw!! An appeal for lbw against batsman and umpire Nigel Llong shakes his head in denial. Well, team have decided to review. Fair delivery. It was the quicker googly and batsman was way out of his crease and the impact is above the knee-roll. What does the ball-tracker say? Three reds and batsman has to go. Llong can't belive it and so can't I. Brilliant review from Mumbai. batsman misses the clip as he didn't the pick the wrong 'un and was also late to bring his bat down. HawkEye showed it be hitting the leg stump. There's the breakthrough and it's the 20-year-old who does the job for the visitors. batsman lbw b bowler 22(20) [4s-3]"
3671,"FOUR, bangs one short does bowler and there's no venom. batsman fetches it from well outside off and swivel-pulls it in front of square on the leg-side. He was in total control of the shot"
3672,"FOUR, fullish ball outside off, batsman opens the bat-face at the very last moment and runs it down to third man. Got it very fine"
3673,"out Caught by Ishan Kishan!! Another review from team. This time against KW for caught behind. Fair delivery. There's a sound. We'll have Ultraedge in a short while to confirm. There's a little spike. Is that enough for the on-field call to be reversed? I wouldn't want to be the third umpire. Well, the call has been made. Overturned! Two overs, two reviews and two wickets. Mumbai are coming back. It was the cutter from bowler and batsman tried to run it down to third man. Gets a faint outside edge and Ishan Kishan pouched it with ease. The keeper and the bowler heard it. batsman c Ishan Kishan b bowler 6(4) [4s-1]"
3674,"out Caught by Bumrah!! In 35 balls that he has bowled in IPL, Mayank bowler has dismissed Dhoni and batsman. His CV will look good, for sure. So, batsman plays a high-risk shot and perishes. Was a quick and flattish leg-break, batsman goes down for the big slog sweep and top-edges straight to the man at long leg. Bumrah, the man in the deep, held his ground and took a calm catch. He was inches in front of the boundary rope. Went a couple of steps back, but looked back to find himself just in. batsman c Bumrah b bowler 45(28) [4s-8]"
3675,"FOUR, shot! Too short, Pandey stays back and cuts it square of the wicket. Powerfully hit"
3676,"SIX, excellent shot to get off the mark. He's in sublime touch, has carried his form into this match too. On a length outside off, stands tall and pumps that over covers for half a dozen. Flat and over the fence"
3677,"SIX, beautiful flick that. Very less margin for error on this wicket. Full on middle and leg, batsman keeps his eyes on the ball and flicks it over mid-wicket with nonchalance. Made that shot look effortless"
3678,"FOUR, 16 runs off the opening over. Couldn't have asked for a better start. On the pads again and all batsman does is clips it past the fielder at short fine leg, he dives there but the ball is too quick for him"
3679,"FOUR, off the mark in style, Agarwal too. Picks the length early, it's short on middle and Agarwal gets in position early to flick it over square leg, fine leg is too square and the ball wins the race"
3680,"FOUR, textbook straight drive! Presenting full face of the bat and high elbows. Fullish in length around off, Agarwal backs away, drives it straight past the bowler and gathers a boundary more"
3681,"2 runs, the leg-break from bowler, batsman reaches out and sweeps it in front of square on the on-side, comes back for the second run"
3682,"FOUR, bowler's over is ruined once again off the last ball, this was tossed up nicely outside off, batsman bent half-forward, reverses his stance and helps it on its way to the long leg fence, make it off the fifth ball"
3683,"out Caught by Sarfaraz Khan!! Oh dear! That's a horror shot from KL, he was looking so good and now plays an atrocious heave, pushed through quicker and wider of off, KL was looking to mow it over the mid-wicket fence, doesn't get anywhere near the pitch of the ball, the fat top-edge loops towards short third man where Sarfaraz takes it with glee. End of a handy knock from the team opener. batsman c Sarfaraz Khan b bowler 47(30) [4s-2 6s-4]"
3684,"out Bowled!! Khejroliya has his first IPL wicket and that's a big one as well. batsman was looking in good touch, decides to up the ante and instead has to walk back to the hut. Short of a length and on the stumps, wasn't short enough for the pull, batsman went through with the shot, connected with thin air and the ball clattered into the top of middle. team are beginning to boss this match now, can team find an answer? batsman b bowler 29(26) [4s-3]"
3685,"leg byes, 1 run, loud shout for LBW and team want a review. Kohli looked very keen to challenge the call. It's a fair delivery from Sundar, it has pitched in line, but is it spinning down leg? There's no bat and Ultraedge confirms it. I don't think it straightened enough, Hawk-Eye in and it's missing the leg-stump. team have lost their review. This was tossed up on middle and was spinning into the right-hander, batsman swept and missed, was struck on the pads, in front of leg and the angle was traking it down the leg-stump. The ball rolls away towards the off-side, the fielder has a shy at the bowler's end and concedes an overthrow"
3686,"SIX, pushed through just outside off, batsman comes down the track, doesn't get close to the ball, went through with the swing and sends it sailing over long-off for a maximum"
3687,"out Stumped!! This is poor cricket from team, they are losing wickets in clusters. Another unnecessary shot from batsman and he's stranded way outside the crease, gave away his intentions way too early, stepped down the track, allows Sundar to shorten his length. He still didn't accept defeat, swung recklessly across the line and missed, an easy stumping for de Kock. batsman st de Kock b bowler 11(9) [6s-1]"
3688,"FOUR, cracking shot, short and on the stumps, batsman swivels across, rolls his wrists and helps it on its way, the man in the deep is square and the ball beats him to the fence"
3689,"FOUR, beautifully played, length delivery outside off, batsman leans forward, drives it on the up and beats the diving fielder at cover, no need to run for those"
3690,"out Lbw!! batsman has been given OUT LBW and he wants a review. This looked adjacent to the naked eye. It's a fair delivery and there's no bat as well. The impact seems to be in front of middle, the height isn't an issue. No edge, says Ultraedge. Hawk-Eye in, three reds and batsman is OUT. Simple call for umpire Ravi and Khejroliya has struck with his last ball. This was full and came back with the angle, batsman shuffled a long way across on the flick, once he missed, it was curtains, decided to take a chance as he reviewed, but to no avail. batsman lbw b bowler 2(3)"
3691,"FOUR, lovely shot, this is turning out to be a fine cameo from batsman, comes down the track, uses his reach to good effect and clears cover with the lofted off-drive, couple of bounces and over the ropes"
3692,"out Caught by Kohli!! This was always coming! Tye was looking to slog everything out of the park, on a good length and just outside off, might have been the slower ball, Tye swung through the line, went off the toe-end of the bat, got plenty of height but not the distance. Kohli ran across to his left from long-on and held on to a simple catch. batsman c Kohli b bowler 7(7)"
3693,"SIX, cracking shot - made it even more special as he was done in completely by the flight. bowler saw his coming, slowed down the pace, dragged it wide of off, batsman reached out and slaps it back over the bowler's head, all the way for a maximum"
3694,"out Stumped!! Has batsman been stumped? de Kock certainly seems confident. It's a fair delivery, the bat is in the air, batsman is way short as well and he's OUT. That's the end of a mighty fine cameo from the team captain, will it be the clinching factor in this match? Smart bowling from bowler, sensed that batsman was coming down the track, threw in a loopy leg-break, batsman came down the track, doesn't get anywhere near the ball, swung across the line in hope and missed, de Kock did the rest. batsman st de Kock b bowler 33(21) [4s-3 6s-1]"
3695,"out Caught by Sarfaraz Khan!! team have been bowled out for 155. team will feel they have done a good job with the ball. This was short and at the stumps, Rahman was backing away on the pull, the ball was just too quick for him, gets a top-edge that lobs behind square on the off-side. de Kock went for the catch, but Sarfaraz called for it and holds on safely. batsman c Sarfaraz Khan b bowler 0(2)"
3696,"FOUR, errs in line after a good start. This is a shortish one on leg and Agarwal doesn't miss out on the chance. Swivels and drags it down to the fine leg fence, can't keep a fielder there"
3697,"out Caught by de Kock!! Stunning catch by de Kock behind the wicket. Full length delivery in the zone around off, Agarwal goes for it, swings hard at it and ends up getting a healthy edge. de Kock flies to his right and pulls off a beauty. So just like always, Agarwal departs after getting off to a flier. Good entertaining cameo! batsman c de Kock b bowler 15(11) [4s-3]"
3698,"out Lbw!! Golden duck for batsman! Umesh is on a hat-trick as the umpire's call stays. It was a length delivery around middle and batsman who tried to flick it off his toes missed it and got struck on the pads. Pitching in line, impact in line and clipping - umpire's call. Can he bag the hat-trick now? batsman lbw b bowler 0(1)"
3699,"FOUR, what was the fielder doing there? He should have been back near the fence. Could have been a straight forward catch there. Short of a length delivery around off, batsman swivels and pulls it over the leaping fielder at deep square leg, guess it was Sarfaraz Khan"
3700,"out Bowled!! Third wicket of the over. Umesh Yadav is on fire! Cleans up batsman with a beautiful delivery. Comes from round the wicket and fires in a length delivery from wide off the crease. batsman who looks to fend it, misses it altogether and the middle-stump is out of here. Look at Umesh's celebration, he's absolutely delighted. Just look at him. Fist pump and all! batsman b bowler 4(4) [4s-1]"
3701,"SIX, batsman continues to march on. Wickets falling at one end won't make him a difference. This one is a short delivery on leg, batsman keeps his calm and pulls it over fine leg, off his hips and over the fence"
3702,"FOUR, Rahul, Agarwal and now batsman. All Karnataka boys have got off the mark with a boundary or six tonight. Full length delivery around off, batsman keeps his head still and drills it past the fielder at mid-off, no chance to stop that"
3703,"SIX, flat and over the fielder at deep square leg. Short and quick on leg, batsman waits for it and drags it powerfully over the man in the deep, that went like a rocket, lot of bottom hand on that blow by batsman"
3704,"FOUR, class apart. It's a short delivery around off, batsman arches back and guides it to perfection over the empty cordon, third man sprints to his left but it's one bounce and over the fence"
3705,"FOUR, no... he doesn't! How often have we seen the last delivery of the over to be the spoiler! Darts it on leg and batsman gets down on his knee to paddle it away and a chase by the fielder is not enough to stop this as the ball races away"
3706,"SIX, excellent shot to get off the mark. He's in sublime touch, has carried his form into this match too. On a length outside off, stands tall and pumps that over covers for half a dozen. Flat and over the fence"
3707,"SIX, beautiful flick that. Very less margin for error on this wicket. Full on middle and leg, batsman keeps his eyes on the ball and flicks it over mid-wicket with nonchalance. Made that shot look effortless"

3736,"FOUR, that came right off the meat. On a length outside off, batsman stays put and punches this sweetly through the gap at covers, sweeper kept it place right after that shot"
3737,"FOUR, Pandya doesn't like it. He's not happy with himself. Bowls a shortish delivery on leg and batsman simply puts it away to the square leg fence with a nonchalant clip off his hips, 11 runs off the opening over"
3738,"SIX, that's huge! Akila concedes his first six of IPL and that's only his second delivery. Nothing much he could have done about it. Flighted one around middle and leg, batsman shimmies down the wicket and smokes it for a 95 metre six over mid-wicket. Welcome to the IPL, chirps Nasser Hussain on air"
3739,"FOUR, the spinner put under pressure right away by Jason. Picks the length early on this short delivery, camps back and hammers it past the fielder at wide long-on, no chance of the stopping that"
3740,"2 runs, oh no! Poor fielding, but it's fifty for Jason batsman, great effort. True pitch, lovely stroke-maker, you got to expect him to come good and boy, he's done well in a stiff chase. Very full and outside off stump, batsman squeezes it out, straight to backward point and it goes right through him"
3741,"FOUR, in the airrr and if Pollard can't get there with that trampoline jump of his, nobody can. Gee these batsmen have no mercy, not even for Jas bowler! Well, this was a freebie ball though, full and in the slot, batsman muscles it hard over mid-off and looks like Pollard has hurt himself coming down hard on the ground"
3742,"FOUR, welcome into the attack Mr. Krunal! batsman will love this - left-armer turning it back into him. Leg-side is going to be busy. This was actually bowled pretty well, very slow although full, batsman delays the lofted drive and manages to hit it straight over the bowler to split long-off and long-on"
3743,"out Caught by Pollard!! That's Pollard for you. Freak on the field. And Krunal roars in delight. Dangerous 69-run stand broken. This was a flighted delivery wide outside off stump, something that left-arm spinners do against left-handed batsmen to take the leg-side out of play, batsman tries to muscle the ball hard through the off-side, wanted to hit towards cover, but he hit straight and Pollard ran quickly to his left, dived and took it air-borne. batsman misses a deserved fifty by three runs. batsman c Pollard b bowler 47(25) [4s-6 6s-2]"
3744,"FOUR, the invitation there from the bowler with the flighted delivery, you can't blame him because he's going for wickets. But just that he's bowled this too full for the batsman to be troubled and batsman smashes it straight over the non-striker's head to take long-on out of the equation"
3745,"SIX, another tossed up one and Maxi slog-sweeps it all the way over backward square leg. It's on the stumps and Maxi won't miss those. bowler's having an of day. Tip for you bowler: If you are bowling to batsman, bowl the away-spinning ones wide outside off stump, hope for batsman to slog and slice one up in the air"
3746,"out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! Oh that's a stunning grab from brother Hardik. Unbelievable. The catch of the tournament so far. This is exactly what Markande should have done in the previous over. Turn it away outside off stump like Krunal did this time. batsman tries to go for a big hit, but the bat turns in his hands on impact with the ball and it's a slice that flies more towards deep extra-cover. But Hardik put his skating boots on, got there and flew full length to his left and took it with both hands horizontal to the ground. Just amazing! Krunal has given a lot of hope for team with 2 wickets in 8 balls. batsman c Hardik Pandya b bowler 13(6) [4s-1 6s-1]"
3747,"2 runs, that's almost another catch. Delhi are going really hard and the opportunity for a wicket is always there. Need a bit of calmness out there. 50 odd 35 balls isn't that tough, especially at the Wankhede. Very full delivery, batsman slogs, connects well, luckily it dipped on SKY who was diving forward"
3748,"SIX, oh what a shot! The quicker delivery from bowler, Iyer slogs really well and the timing is exceptional, sails into the second tier over the mid-wicket boundary"
3749,"SIX, this game is so unkind to the bowlers. bowler has actually deceived the batsman in flight and with length, batsman, who was jumping out of the crease was nowhere close to the pitch of the ball, but he's gifted with timing and has a great willow in his hands and that combo is good enough for him to back himself and go through with the lofted hit over the bowler's head"
3750,"FOUR, that should have been stopped by Rahul Chahar at deep point. Short and wide outside off stump, Iyer cuts, Chahar got there running to his left from sweeper, but he fumbled"
3751,"1 run, dropped, tough chance though! Fizz the man there at short third man. Slower delivery wide outside off stump, Iyer checks the dab, gets a leading edge that flies to the left of short third, Fizz moved to his left and dived, but couldn't hold on. Massive moment in the game"
3752,"FOUR, a dropped catch and then the team's best bowler has been carted away for four next ball. Five runs off 2 balls and the asking rate is only around 9. Short of a length delivery on the stumps, batsman pulls powerfully and there's no one at deep square leg to stop the boundary"
3753,"FOUR, slower ball alright, but this is way outside off stump, Iyer delays the cut shot, puts it past backward point and the man sweeping the off-side boundary could not cut it off as well"
3754,"1 run, another catch put down and it's Fizz again. You don't deserve to win if you are going to field like that. That stare from Rohit Sharma tells it all. Silence all around the Wankhede. Good length delivery outside off stump, Iyer backs away and slices it, went to the right of short third man, easy catch and he spills it"
3755,"FOUR, there is deep square leg, there is deep mid-wicket but batsman has expertly split them both with a well timed pull shot. bowler went normal pace on this short ball and it didn't rise high enough for Iyer to be troubled"
3756,"FOUR, that's a quality hit from batsman but hang on, why on earth did you bowl normal pace bowler? Full and wide outside off stump, batsman drills the drive over cover and there's no one in the deep. Great start to the over for DD"
3757,"SIX, uppish and all the way. Scores level! What a hit under pressure. With a boundary through the off-side previous ball and a field set for the leg-side, batsman knows that the bowler isn't going to bowl outside off stump, so he moves across and flicks this short of length delivery with a strong bottom hand grip to send it clear of the man at fine leg"
3758,"no run, a hat-trick of dots, you are kidding me! Slower delivery again that spins across, batsman pokes at it and misses. team review just like that, obviously no edge on that. Gee this is unbelievable stuff"
3759,"FOUR, one bounce and into the cushions. That'll release a bit of pressure off batsman. Picks the length early, rocks back and pulls the shortish delivery over square leg, one bounce and into the fence"
3760,"SIX, in the arc out of the park. Full length delivery, a knuckle ball and batsman with a lot of authority picks it up over wide long-on, would have been a six on any ground"
3761,"SIX, ahh, that was even better than the previous six. Short delivery again, batsman transfers his weight on to the back foot and murders it over square leg with a pull, 96 metre biggie that one, this is why he's in the team"
3762,"FOUR, he's looking unstoppable, just like the team openers were earlier in the day. Pandya dishes a full length delivery around off, batsman stays put and pummels it right over the bowler's head"
3763,"out Caught by Rohit!! The Fizz strikes, gets the DD skipper. batsman was struggling and his struggle finally comes to an end. Short of a length around off and the opener goes ahead with the pull. As there's a bit extra bounce on the delivery, it catches the top edge and Rohit Sharma at short mid-wicket does the rest. Should have given the strike to Roy who's striking the ball so well. This wicket might affect Roy's mindset now! batsman c Rohit b bowler 15(16) [4s-2]"
3764,"FOUR, first one of the innings for batsman. This was short and wide outside off and was meant to be put away. batsman doesn't miss out, reaches for it and thrashes it away, beats sweeper cover quite comfortably"
3765,"FOUR, strong bottom hand on that. Flatter delivery around off and it's short too, batsman drags it away with a firm pull and beats the man at deep mid-wicket this time around, this was a powerful blow by the pocket-sized dynamite"
3766,"FOUR, reverse swept! Shortish delivery around off, batsman does well to reverse sweep that over short third man, gets four more"
3767,"SIX, so much power on that. Was a tossed up delivery around off, batsman went down on his knee and smoked it flat over long-off, even a leaping Pollard near the fence couldn't take the catch"
3768,"FOUR, bowler is not having a good day with the ball. 10 runs in the first over, already 16 off this. Went down on his knee and swept that flighted delivery over square leg nicely, two boundaries and a six in this over"
3769,"SIX, batsman pumps it! Shimmies down the wicket and towers the flighted delivery right over the bowler's head for six more, straight as an arrow that was"
3770,"FOUR, and the boundaries continue to flow. Follows it up with a sweet sweep. Loopy delivery around off, batsman goes down and sweeps it firmly towards the long leg fence"
3771,"SIX, the partnership between batsman and Roy is more than 50! Tossed up delivery around off, batsman puts on his dancing shoes and slaugters it over long-on to bring up Delhi's 100 in style"
3772,"FOUR, mid-off a touch squarer and this full length delivery finds a way. Driven with a straight bat. Always on with the ball nicely pitched up in your half"
3773,"FOUR, just a trifle short that and batsman swivels with the incoming angle. Blasts it one-legged in front of the square leg umpire"
3774,"leg byes, FOUR, leg byes given but looked like there was some bat. Hung over from the last boundary, bowler tries to cramp batsman for room and overdoes it with a gimme down leg. Glanced away for four runs. Who cares if it's off the bat or not.."
3775,"FOUR, misfielded by Maxwell at mid-on. Flat from bowler, batsman wrists it away and basks in the glory of someone else's plight"
3776,"out Lbw!! Big, big appeal from the keeper more so than anyone else. Given. Now then, Suryakumar deliberates with his partner for a reasonable amount of time, before taking the review. Did the ball straighten enough, or was it sliding down? It's clipping leg-stump according to ball-tracking. So the umpire's call will stay. What a precious spell this has been from bowler, standing out amid the carnage to remove both the opening batsmen. Suryakumar was quickly down on his knees to sweep this hard, but failed to connect. It didn't grip the pitch much after drifting in, but gripped just enough to be clipping the stump. batsman lbw b bowler 53(32) [4s-7 6s-1]"
3777,"FOUR, this is beautifully done from batsman. So deft. Perfectly good delivery from bowler, turning in from a length towards off. batsman's intentions are highly concealed all the way through, but just when the ball is about to pass him, he lays the softest of touches to deflect it past the keeper's glove into the third man boundary"
3778,"FOUR, oh poor delivery. He's fired this well down leg, Kishan sees the opportunity early and paddle-swats it to the fine leg boundary"
3779,"FOUR, he's bowled pretty short to Kishan so far, and unlike before, this time he's punished for it. Kishan rocks back and thumps his pull over mid-wicket"
3780,"SIX, oh my, he's brought out the reverse-sweep and it's gone for six. Completely switched his legs around, got blessed with a full toss and walloped it over backward point"
3781,"SIX, six more to finish the over, ruins the figures of Tewatia. Puts his dancing shoes on, and despite not getting to the pitch of it, he's able to drag it away over the wide long-on boundary. The key was that he went through with it"
3782,"FOUR, goes for the slower short ball again, but gets it down leg. With fine leg up, batsman only has to help his pull past the fielder in the circle, which he comfortably does after swivelling into the shot"
3783,"FOUR, 124kph, short of length delivery just outside off, Kishan cheekily dabs it fine of short third man"
3784,"FOUR, these are weird tactics. Both fine leg and third man are up, so you'd expect the length to be full. But bowler's gone short more often than not. Now agreed, this one rushes Kishan on the pull as he's taken by surprise. But he swings into it and the top-edge balloons past the keeper. Always a risk with this field"
3785,"2 runs, short of length delivery angled in on middle, 116kph, thwacked through square leg on the front foot. They amble back for two"
3786,"FOUR, just over extra-cover! 117kph, length ball wide of off, Kishan had to reach out for it but he throws everything and is able to smear it over the fielder"
3787,"out Bowled!! Switches his legs, looks for the reverse-sweep again but completely misses this full toss. It rams into middle and leg stump from round the wicket. He was doing a decent job of hitting straight, probably didn't need to do that. But a superb knock nevertheless. batsman b bowler 44(23) [4s-5 6s-2]"
3788,"out Bowled!! Would you believe it, bowler now has two in two. batsman walks out to him first ball, tries to work this length ball round the corner but misses it. The ball gets stuck in his thigh pad and dips behind to knock over off-stump. These are crucial strikes as Delhi hope to reign things back. batsman b bowler 0(1)"
3789,"FOUR, off-cutter from bowler, but it's right in the slot for Krunal to hammer it over mid-off"
3790,"out Caught by Roy!! Sliced up in the air, Roy lumbers across from long-off and takes it comfortably. Lovely bowling from bowler. He slanted this off-cutter away from batsman's swiping zone, and it gripped further away from him after pitching. Despite that, batsman doesn't quite smarten up. He swings cross-batted and slices it off the outside half. batsman c Roy b bowler 18(15) [4s-2]"
3791,"out Caught by Rahul Tewatia!! What is happening? It's been lapped straight into the hands of short fine leg, but the umpire has gone upstairs for some reason. Oh wait, his decision was not out, and so Delhi reviewed it immediately. Bizarre. It looked like it came straight off the bat-face. Krunal walks across for the scoop, gets a thick inside edge onto thigh pad and it spoons up to Tewatia. So the decision will be overturned. batsman c Rahul Tewatia b bowler 11(10) [4s-1]"
3792,"out Caught by Shreyas Iyer!! Another one falls. An off-cutter from bowler, Hardik mistimes the slog off the inside half and holes out. Iyer, it seemed like, had lost it in the sun initially. But he picked it up in time and then sunk low for the grab. batsman c Shreyas Iyer b bowler 2(3)"
3793,"2 runs, dropped by Trent Boult but geez that was a good attempt. Top-edge on the slog-sweep -- told ya that bowler was bowling slower in this over -- Boult runs back from backward square leg, doesn't get beneath the ball but doesn't stay put there. Rushes in front and stops the boundary. Top class athlete with a short term memory loss for good"
3794,"FOUR, nicely done. He's not giving up. Pitched it right up there again, desperately hoping for some swing, but is driven handsomely down the ground"
3795,"FOUR, that's box-office chic and very good thinking. Short ball angled across, batsman's ducking initially, then sees that the height isn't much and ramps that over to the third man fence with utter style"
3796,"SIX, early signs: good pitch against the new ball. Length ball right in batsman's arc and he goes for it. Will go, 10 out of 10 times. Swings it over long-on"
3797,"FOUR, that's dropped a touch short, so even though it's turning the ball's hittable. batsman rocks back and slaps that disparagingly wide of mid-off"
3798,"SIX, that's been hit to the ESA kids in the stands. Brings up Mumbai's fastest fifty in IPL. Dragged down from round the wicket, left-handed batsman goes back and clouts it over deep mid-wicket. It was a pull but more casually ruthless"
3799,"SIX, bowler does this. Drops it harmlessly on a back of a length on leg-stump, and batsman's been served a pie. Helps it over fine leg with a good arm swing"
3800,"FOUR, now this is a fine, fine yorker.. and look what happens. batsman squeezes it out with an open bat face and has that scooting to the third man fence. Who says cricket's for egalitarians?!"
3801,"FOUR, let's say bowler's gotten obsessed with bowling yorkers. More yorkers. Better yorkers. He wants redemption for that boundary that batsman hit earlier in the over. Goes for one again, bowls a low full toss on leg-stump instead -- how? why? what? -- and is flicked round the corner"
3802,"FOUR, from over the wicket and that's been pitched full. Right there to be hit. batsman doesn't even bother about the footwork. Stays put and slamns that through wide mid-off"
3803,"FOUR, about time we saw a half-volley. All he had to do was stay leg-side of the ball and deflect it with an open bat face. Does so, and it's a boundary through cover-point"
3804,"FOUR, another. Keep 'em counting. Another half-volley, and this one's been scorched through covers with an elegant bat flow. The deliveries remain the same, only batsman's shots are evolving into something more telegenic"
3805,"SIX, this is unreal unravelling of bowler, and Delhi Daredevils. Slower on a length say, batsman clears his front leg and sends it romping over long-off. More timing than anything else"
3806,"SIX, it's a slower googly from bowler, which allows batsman to come down the track and lever it over straightish long-on"
3807,"out Caught by Roy!! Looked like a googly but replays show it's a quick slider, angling across from over the wicket, which gets the wicket. batsman shimmies down the track, isn't quite to the pitch of the ball and ends up slicing it to long-off, where Jason Roy runs in and takes the catch reverse-cupped. batsman c Roy b bowler 48(28) [4s-4 6s-4]"
3808,"2 runs, now he's hanging the ball flat in the air. Full, worked to long-on and that's a half-century for batsman off 29 balls. Second of his career. Wankhede crowd go berserk with the flags. Quite blue."
3809,"FOUR, that's a cracking shot. Width on offer and Lynn makes the most of it. Short and wide outside off, throws his bat at it and crunches it past the fielder at point, races away to the fence in no time"
3810,"FOUR, Williamson pulls off a blinder, almost. Good length delivery around off, Lynn goes ahead with his lofted shot and miscues it over mid-off, Williamson goes back running, extends his right arm but can't take the catch, the ball crawls away to the long-off boundary"
3811,"FOUR, throws his hands at another ball drifting away and shoots an outside edge over the two fielders behind square on the off-side"
3812,"out Caught by Williamson!! This is just a culmination of what was brewing. bowler's getting the ball to drift away, batsman's throwing his bat and getting lucky. Not this time. Off the toe-end, there's Williamson at wide long-on, having covered some ground from mid-wicket and tumbling behind to take this one. Lovely catch. He's on fire in the field, is Williamson, this IPL. batsman c Williamson b bowler 9(10) [4s-1]"
3813,"out Caught&Bowled!! bowler's stretched into double his height with this sideways dive and taken this left-handed inches above the ground. A bit of replays there to ascertain the dismissal but that's out. Kolkata crowd knows it. Arm-ball again that sticks a bit in the pitch, batsman's making room down leg and can only tamely pop it back down the pitch. And then bowler takes over. batsman c and b bowler 49(34) [4s-7 6s-1]"
3814,"SIX, Hooda's flown in the air, caught it reverse-cupped and strewn that back in the playing field. Or has he? Nah, the left foot just hits the deep point ropes. Russell throws his arms at the width, with weight still on the front foot. Just throwing his arms.."
3815,"out Caught by Manish Pandey!! Manish Pandey, that's some catch. But what's Russell upto? Another one that he totally wanted to hit into the stands. Stays leg-side of the ball and wafts, and ends up slicing it. Into the night sky, Manish Pandey runs back from backward point, with his back to the ball, and leaps in front to take that. There was third man in the vicinity too but he just leaves it to Manish, and for the right reasons. batsman c Manish Pandey b bowler 9(5) [6s-1]"
3816,"FOUR, back of a length delivery, punched exquisitely behind point"
3817,"out Caught by Shakib!! bowler is too good for a debutant. Takes the pace off again with his knuckles and gets the ball to dart away. And batsman, overcommitted on the front foot, reaches out, only to slice that over to extra cover. batsman c Shakib b bowler 3(9)"
3818,"FOUR, another leg break, batsman waits and waits before dabbing that just wide of the keeper. Boundary through third man"
3819,"2 runs, Rashid thinks he has batsman LBW and Williamson reviews.. Missed his sweep there, deflecting the ball to short fine leg. And guess what, he hasn't missed it. It's taken the under-side of the glove and gone to short fine leg, who with a wide throw at the bowler's end allowed the second"
3820,"SIX, what a price to pay. Slower ball again, batsman picks it up and mauls the free-hit ball over long-off"
3821,"out Caught by Saha!! These knuckle balls are sticking in the pitch and darting away. batsman gets a top-edge on his attempted flat-batted swish, for the keeper to take a good catch few paces to his right. batsman c Saha b bowler 29(27) [4s-2 6s-1]"
3822,"FOUR, the power of Lynn on that shot will take that away to the fence. Slower delivery, the knuckle ball by Bhuvi, Lynn backs away and goes through with his horizontal slap, beats the man at mid-on and finds the fence. Wasn't middled properly but those muscles help him"
3823,"out Caught by Saha!! batsman thought that he would get away with it but DRS comes to Sunrisers' rescue. Short delivery outside off, Robin tries to run that down to third man but ends up getting a slight edge to that. UltraEdge confirms the same and the ploy to open with batsman has back fired. batsman c Saha b bowler 3(8)"
3824,"FOUR, crunched away! Good length delivery angled away from the batsman, Rana rocks back and slams that through the gap at point, lightning speed on that as the batsman gets his first boundary, on the first ball. Positive start for the southpaw"
3825,"out Caught by Bhuvneshwar!! Imagine Bhuvneshwar escaping a collision with Stanlake.. he offers a smile but I think it's for more than just pulling off this catch. It's relief personified. Another knuckle ball this from Kaul, batsman reaches out and pops it behind off the toe-end. It's Bhuvi's catch at short fine leg but there's Stanlake, rushing past the keeper to attempt to take this. Just about evades his teammate to my relief. batsman c Bhuvneshwar b bowler 7(8)"
3826,"FOUR, slapped away! Knuckle delivery, fraction short and outside off, Lynn frees his arms and goes aerial, evades cover-point with a cut and manages to get four runs"
3827,"FOUR, lucky favoring Lynn tonight. This is a slower delivery again, full in length around off, the big man swings hard at it and manages to get an inside edge, past the stumps, past the man at short fine leg and into the fence"
3828,"FOUR, glorious! He's off to a flier, like always. This is a full length ball and well outside off, Lynn doesn't miss out and drills it through covers, right into the gap, Kaul greeted with 14 runs, quite expensive."
3829,"SIX, that's massive. Such sweetly it was timed. Picks the googly early, gets down on his knee and slog sweeps it over mid-wicket, high and handsome that was"
3830,"FOUR, ends the over with a cracking boundary. This was short and width was there, enough for the batsman to go ahead with his square cut and find the fence"
3831,"out Caught by Manish Pandey!! Excellent grab by Manish that, fumbles on the first attempt but manages to hold on as he's about to hit the ground. Was short and wide outside off, Rana cut that hard to point where a rather sharp Manish pulled off a screamer. Replays confirm that the catch was taken and team strike right aftter the break. bowler is absolutely loving this, bounce and pace has helped him put the pressure on Rana as he gets his scalp. batsman c Manish Pandey b bowler 18(16) [4s-2 6s-1]"
3832,"1 run, Manish Pandey is on fire in the field tonight, as he almost pulls off yet another stunner. Leaps up in the air near the boundary, takes the catch and parries it away as he's about to hit the ground. batsman walked down the track and lofted that to long-on where Pandey plucked it, parried it and tried to take it on the second attempt with a desperate dive, but hard luck. Could have been six on any other day."
3833,"SIX, that's high, miles up in the air... Was the knuckle ball and Lynn went hard at it, towers it up towards long-off where Rashid settles underneath but goes for it only with his left hand, gets a bit on that and eventually parries it over the fence. Was a very tough chance that, difficult to spot those in the night sky"
3834,"FOUR, another inside edge and Lynn survives. Fullish around off, Lynn swings hard at it and gets an inside edge past the leg-stump, moves on to 46* with that boundary"
3835,"FOUR, first runs off the bat from batsman and team. It was on the stumps, batsman gets in the position quickly and whips it wide of the fine leg fielder for a four"
3836,"FOUR, just over of the square leg fielder. It was on a good length and outside off, batsman pulls it off the front root, manages to clear the fielder and ball races for a four"
3837,"FOUR, another short of length delivery, batsman gets into position quickly and pulls it in front of square for a four. He doesn't time it as well as he would have liked but the placement is good enough"
3838,"FOUR, batsman puts this away. Much needed release of pressure. Short googly from Yadav, the team captain sits back and pumps it through mid-wicket"
3839,"FOUR, four more. Two short balls in a row from Yadav. He'll be disappointed by this. Googly on leg-stump, batsman picks length early, gets down low and swats it through backward square"
3840,"FOUR, batsman swivels into the pull but is clearly hurried by this short of length delivery. He's lucky that the top-edge has flown over the keeper's head"
3841,"FOUR, now goes over mid-off! He was actually done in by the slower ball, as evidenced by his bottom hand coming off, but more importantly, he went through with it"
3842,"SIX, woah, the ball has gone skimming over the third man boundary. Boy he hit this hard. Short and wide, a ferocious slash from batsman. Gets all of it. Massive over in the context of the game - 16 off it. team back in control"
3843,"SIX, batsman uses the pace of Mavi, all 140kph of it, and whips the pull away over long leg. What a brilliant shot. He swivelled across, remained on the front foot while pushing his weight back and used his wrists gloriously"
3844,"out Bowled!! Through him. Flat through the air from bowler, zoots it through batsman who's on the prowl down the pitch. Never allowed him to get anywhere close to the ball, cramped him up and it deflected off his pad onto middle stump. Do team still have hope here? batsman b bowler 27(21) [4s-2 6s-1]"
3845,"no run, now then, there's a review from team for leg-before. Hooda didn't pick a googly from bowler and was hit on the back pad. But in real time, it looked like the impact may have been outside off. Oh wait, there's an inside edge too. So that's that"
3846,"1 run, another out-swinger on a good length, punched down to long-off. Brings up the fifty for batsman. He has to finish this off for his team, lest the follow the route they took against Mumbai"
3847,"out Caught by A Russell!! batsman flicks this straight into the hands of square leg, what a soft dismissal! He immediately throws his head back, not able to believe what he's just done. Good length ball on leg-stump, and this is a loose shot from the captain. Just so lacklustre. This could get interesting. batsman c A Russell b bowler 50(44) [4s-4 6s-1]"
3848,"FOUR, Pathan kills the crowd's enthusiasm, crashes this full ball through extra cover. What a hit. He nailed this drive to the fence"
3849,"FOUR, hoists this over extra-cover. Pathan's stepping up to the occasion against his former franchise. Back of length delivery outside off, he gets it close to the bottom of the bat but there's enough on the drive to clear cover"
3850,"SIX, that will be it. The team dugout rises as Pathan pulls this short ball into the stands. team pull off their first win at the Eden Gardens"
3851,"FOUR, bowler is becoming predictable here with his length. It was on a short of length again, batsman holds his shape and pulls it over square leg for another four."
3852,"FOUR, another slower ball outside off from bowler. batsman reads the change in pace and drives it through the off-side for a four"
3853,"FOUR, cracking shot! It was touch fuller of good length, batsman lofts it wide of the mid-on fielder for a four. he played that shot with a straight bat and that made it even better. Minimum risk and effective result!"
3854,"out Caught by Karthik!! team gets the much needed breakthrough. batsman doesn't even wait for the finger to go up as he walks back. It was an off-spinner down the leg-side, batsman gets a faint tickle to it and Karthik behind the stumps makes no mistake. batsman c Karthik b bowler 24(15) [4s-5]"
3855,"FOUR, beautiful use of the feet from batsman. He comes down the track and drives it wide of the mid-off fielder for a four"
3856,"FOUR, goes on the back foot in a flash and drives it through cover for another four. Stellar timing from the skipper"
3857,"out Bowled!! bowler is on fire! His second wicket in that many overs. He is ensuring that team remains in the game. It was an off-spinner and batsman was late onto it, trying to play across the line. Ball hits his pads and goes onto hit the stumps. batsman will be gutted with this shot. batsman b bowler 7(7) [4s-1]"
3858,"out Lbw!! Pandey was chatting with Williamson regarding the review but umpire says time is up and batsman will have to depart. It was a flighted delivery which turned in after pitching, batsman's bat was behind the pads and ball raps him on the pads. It looked adjacent, the only question was whether it was going down the leg-side. Umpire thinks it wasn't and he raises his finger slowly in a stylish manner. batsman lbw b bowler 4(11)"
3859,"FOUR, McCullum is off the mark and so is team, that too in style. Short and wide outside off, Brendon punches it hard towards cover and a misfield by Samson results in a boundary. He has scored 91* but can't take fielding lightly"
3860,"out Caught by Stokes!! Whatta catch that! Eye-candy that take was. Was a short delivery around off, McCullum rocked back and pulled it hard to deep mid-wicket where Stokes timed his jump and he was in the air as he reverse cupped it. Probably one of the best catches of the season. batsman c Stokes b bowler 4(4) [4s-1]"
3861,"FOUR, elegance personified there. Full length delivery outside off, batsman walks down the track and creams his drive, through the gap at cover and there's no stopping that, such was the precision in the placement"
3862,"FOUR, Chinnaswamy erupts as batsman smokes one. Backs away, reaches for it and slams the length delivery over covers, one bounce and into the fence. Was middled to perfection, sweet sound of the willow too"
3863,"FOUR, another impressive shot. After two shots on the off-side, batsman gets one through the on side. Moves towards the pitch of the delivery, keeps his eyes on the ball and flicks it over mid-wicket. Three boundaries already in the over. This is going to be an exciting run chase if batsman keeps playing like this"
3864,"out Caught by D Arcy Short!! He's got him, he's got him. bowler is running around with an arm raised. Pretty much a half-tracker which batsman pulls in the vicinity of deep mid-wicket. It's D'Arcy Short there, who leaps across for an excellent take. Oh what a game-changer this. batsman c D Arcy Short b bowler 57(30) [4s-6 6s-2]"
3865,"FOUR, slower back of length ball again, this time there's a little bit of width which allows AB to carve it away between backward point and short third man. It was uppish, but the placement was spot on"
3866,"out Caught by Unadkat!! bowler has turned this game right on its head. First Kohli, and now batsman. team should really back themselves from here. Another half-tracker really, but batsman doesn't get hold of his pull and hits it straight towards long leg. Unadkat seemed to have misjudged it initially, but he's able to make amends by taking an excellent low catch. Wry smile on batsman's face. He could have hit this anywhere. Just not his day. batsman c Unadkat b bowler 20(18) [4s-1 6s-1]"
3867,"SIX, nailed over long-on. Gentle off-break from bowler which is right in the slot. batsman grounds his back knee and wallops it through the line"
3868,"out Caught by Buttler!! Done in by the off-cutter. batsman tries flicking it through mid-wicket, but there was enough cut on the ball to take a thick outside edge. Good take from Buttler diving forward, should help his bruised confidence. batsman c Buttler b bowler 3(4)"
3869,"FOUR, normal pace from bowler this time, batsman uses those extra 10kph and slices it away through backward point. Nicely done"
3870,"SIX, punishes the slower ball this time. He set himself up for it and launched it over wide long-on"
3871,"FOUR, short of length delivery outside off, batsman slices the cut away through backward point. The ball spun away from sweeper cover who dived too early and fell at least 3 feet short of getting to it"
3872,"FOUR, bowler not having a great time here. Bowls this full and wide outside off, batsman stretches across and slices it for another boundary, this time wide of third man"
3873,"SIX, parried over the ropes for six! Gowtham was standing around 5 yards inside the boundary, stretched his arm out while back-pedaling but never looked like taking it. May have been a different story had he been all the way back. Slower short of length delivery, sits up for Sundar who thwacks it down the ground"
3874,"FOUR, these are all useful runs to reduce the margin of defeat. Surely they can't win this can they? bowler misses his yorker by a couple of inches and is sliced away over backward point"
3875,"SIX, now carves this slower ball inside-out for six. Wow. Clean strike from batsman who picked the variation early and smoked it into the crowd. Brings the crowd to life"
3876,"out Bowled!! How unlucky is this for Sundar. He's lapped this full toss right off the bat-face onto middle stump. Walked across, got down low, and set himself up perfectly. But just couldn't get under it unfortunately to gain the elevation needed. batsman b bowler 35(19) [4s-1 6s-3]"
3877,"FOUR, gets inside this short of length delivery and helps the pull over short fine leg. It was really well done because this was a slower ball and there really wasn't a lot of pace to work with"
3878,"FOUR, slower ball which swings away from batsman. He gets down low, uses the swing and slices it past short third man. Wonderful batting"
3879,"FOUR, just short of the yorker mark, and batsman takes toll by hammering it down the ground for four. Really good showing from him, even though in a losing cause"
3880,"FOUR, batsman continues to deal in boundaries. Rocks back, picks the length early and punches it through the gap at covers again, away she goes, into the fence"
3881,"FOUR, first one of the innings for batsman. He has joined the skipper now. Flatter in trajectory and outside off, batsman doesn't miss out on it and slaps it through the gap at covers, he needs to play along with Kohli if team want to make a match out of it. Can't be chased alone this target"
3882,"FOUR, beautiful! Pitches it on middle and leg, batsman makes sure to send it to the long-on fence with a fine on-drive, team... team... are the chants all across the stadium"
3883,"FOUR, there's no stopping these two. Tossed up delivery around off, batsman reaches for it with a shimmy and times his chip over long-off, quality shot"
3884,"FOUR, another one! The bowlers have no answers to this brilliance by the team pair. The left hand - right hand combination is make it difficult for the bowlers. This was floated on middle and batsman went down on his knee to sweep it through square leg"
3885,"FOUR, ""welcome into the attack Mr bowler,"" says batsman. Picks the length on that short one early and makes sure to pummel it over mid-wicket, he's in the zone guys."
3886,"1 run, 50-run stand up with that single as batsman drags it away to deep mid-wicket, the crowd thought it was in the gap, but it wasn't"
3887,"FOUR, can't bowl such freebies to a batsman of this class. It's a juicy full toss outside off, batsman brings his bat down in time and angles it past the fielder at point, he's toying with the field here, finding those gaps with ease"
3888,"FOUR, right into the gap there! Shortish delivery on middle and leg, batsman goes back and pulls it with authority beating the man at deep mid-wicket"
3889,"SIX, smoked it! batsman's one hand came off but then too he manages to get a six. One hand or two hands, doesn't matter. Was a floated delivery around off and batsman towered it over long-on"
3890,"out Caught by Unadkat!! Failed with the bat earlier today but makes up for it with this huge wicket. Bowls a shortish delivery on the pads and batsman who looks to put it away with a pull finds the fielder in the deep, it's Unadkat who grabs it. Wait on... it's AB who walks out to bat in next. Get ready for some more fireworks! batsman c Unadkat b bowler 26(19) [4s-4]"
3891,"1 run, 31st IPL fifty for batsman! team want him to get a big one tonight, he's not done yet. Was a loopy delivery that was driven down to long-on"
3892,"SIX, insult to injury! Missed on a wicket on the last ball and goes for a six on the very next ball. Shortish delivery, a half-tracker and batsman pummels it over wide long-on for a towering six, that was huge again"
3893,"SIX, only one hand on that. Full length delivery outside off, batsman goes for it with full swing and manages to clear covers"
3894,"FOUR, juicy. He's in some weird mood, happy to go horizontally right away, gets that length that sits up, hoping to be smacked. Obliged. Airy over mid-wicket"
3895,"FOUR, that sitting up length. On the tummy, quite batsman' staple. He stays up, lets it get in his arc and heaves. Those muscles .. through mid-wicket"
3896,"SIX, blimey, what a blow! Some momentum into the team innings now. This was fired fuller around middle and leg, batsman held his shape and swung through the line. Sent it soaring over long-on for a biggie"
3897,"FOUR, high quality shot! Why move around the in the crease and swipe when you can play shots like this. This was full and quite wide as well, batsman played the square drive late to bisect short third man and backward point with precision. Top stuff!!"
3898,"SIX, ahhhh, this is vintage batsman! Back of a length around middle and leg, easy for him as he swivels just a touch before drop kicking this over deep fine leg. Easy pickings"
3899,"out Bowled!! Chopped on! Massive strike from bowler, just like he did in his previous over. The leg spinner to a left-hander is always a double-edged sword, this wicket proves it. Slows this down and drags it wider outside off, batsman wanted to fetch it with a slog sweep but only managed a thick under edge that clattered onto the woodwork. Just when this partnership was gearing up to go up another level, it was been halted. batsman b bowler 27(21) [4s-2 6s-1]"
3900,"FOUR, signature batsman start! Wastes no time to get going. Brings out the reverse sweep and takes this on the full, makes enough connection to beat a diving backward point. Finds the fence"
3901,"byes, FOUR, geee, that's beaten everyone! Comedy of errors really. batsman went for premeditated paddle, de Kock anticipated and was en route to his left already but guess what, the stroke didn't connect and the ball went through the yawning gap between first slip and the keeper"
3902,"SIX, hammered away! batsman is on the rampage now. Of course, half-trackers like these help as well. Was on the back foot in a jiffy and smashed the pull over deep mid-wicket"
3903,"FOUR, edged but no slip! You don't expect one at this stage of a T20 inning either for most bowlers. Lovely piece of bowling from bowler, floated up nicely to invite the drive from batsman and forced the edge as well. Too hard for de Kock and it raced past him to the fence"
3904,"SIX, gobbles up the Free Hit! Umesh is having a horror day. This is a full toss on leg, batsman just shuffles a touch and mows it over deep mid-wicket. Deep into the crowd"
3905,"SIX, just over deep mid-wicket! Slower and a fraction short from bowler, batsman sits on the back foot and went through with the pull shot. Didn't quite middle this as much as he would have wanted, still got it over McCullum who tried with all his might"
3906,"1 run, another excellent yorker, it's been a top over from bowler thus far. batsman squeezes it out towards point to get to his 8th IPL fifty! Is this the breakthrough season he wanted? Has definitely started that way"
3907,"SIX, deep into the crowd! batsman has activated the beast mode, danger signs for team if they don't get him quickly. Back of a length around middle and off, batsman sat on the back foot and smoked it way over deep mid-wicket. Huge biggie"
3908,"SIX, what a beautiful shot! Jeepers, this kid is such a delight to watch when on song. Such class! Full and outside off, his bat face did turn in his hands but he got it dead straight even then. Cleared long-off easily"
3909,"SIX, batsmannnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn! What quality strokeplay! Fullish ball around middle and leg, batsman makes room by backing away lot and just goes through with the extension of the loft down the ground. Such timing and over long-off again it is, deeper this time. 16 off the over!"
3910,"out Caught by Kohli!! Soft dismissal! bowler tried the yorker but ended up delivering a pacy low full toss. batsman just tried to check the lofted stroke, perhaps got a touch late on it and ended up chipping it straight to mid-off where the team skipper swallowed it up. He's wearing an animated look on his face as well. Vital wicket this for team, batsman could easily have a made a difference of about 10 runs. batsman c Kohli b bowler 23(14) [4s-2 6s-1]"
3911,"SIX, hammered into long-on! batsman's merry ways continue. He is batting on another level now. Slower ball on a shortish length, he just waits for it and slaps through the line. No real effort there, at least not visible but gee the timing, ever so perfect! Another biggie"
3912,"FOUR, gets it away very, very fine! Didn't intend to get it that fine perhaps but he won't mind, will he? The perfect yorker from bowler but batsman digs it out with an open bat face. Manages to slice itwell past a diving de Kock to the fence. When it's your day, it's just your day!"
3913,"FOUR, didn't I tell you that this is his day? batsman survives once more. Fuller ball and he goes for the lofted stroke over cover. For a moment, the man at sweeper cover thought he had a chance but was late I guess. Put in a late dive and it bounced before him, then sped through to the fence"
3914,"SIX, H-U-G-E! For a change, it's not Samson who hits a biggie. The young batsman joins in the fun now and boy, he has clubbed this almost into the top tier of the ground. Slower and fuller, tries to follow the batsman but batsman is equal to the task. Makes room and clubs it easily over long-on. The crowd had to take cover there"
3915,"FOUR, bleeding runs! Slower and short, the leg stump line doesn't help and batsman swivels to pull it easily over square leg. Another boundary"
3916,"SIX, no stopping batsman here! As if he needed a Free Hit to hit them big. Very full from Yadav and batsman gets under it with ease, clubbed comfortably over long-off. Ho ho ho!!"
3917,"SIX, this time over deep extra cover! Incredible stuff from batsman, it's been an exhibition from him this afternoon. Full and wide outside off, he just makes room to lift it over the sweeper cover fence for a boundary. Unstoppable!"
3918,"FOUR, thank the injury. When you can't run, you slog. batsman sits, uses the line already down leg to sweep. Hard. Behind square. One-bounced"
3919,"SIX, now downtown. Sundar overcorrects going fuller, batsman steps away, gives his hands room. And they swing, into the sightscreen"
3920,"FOUR, backs away in the crease, converts it into one in his slot and goes all bottom-handed in lofting into cow corner. One way of avoiding run-outs"
3921,"FOUR, hoick. Mid-wicket. Again. It's getting familiar. Another friendly length for batsman to get under and smoke it down"
3922,"FOUR, on the sweep. Never mind the top-edge, the powerplay is his ally. His stride doesn't quite get him to the pitch of it, the spin's big too. But these big bats allow him to clear square leg, and that's enough"
3923,"FOUR, oh these nice float-ups. Short ain't getting foxed, lets it dip. Loads up. Might swing. And flat down the ground"
3924,"FOUR, he's toying around. May his leg never recover. Makes bowler bowl straight, threatening a move around. But sways inside the line, flat-batted and hammers it round the corner. Pile on the powerplay"
3925,"out Caught by U Yadav!! There's the miscue. It was coming. This entire stay was so un-batsman. Slogging, but with good reason. So he gets a fuller-slower one now, he's camping on his back foot, goes to smoke it straight over. Doesn't time, gets it off the bottom half, flies high. And down mid-on's backtracking reverse cup. batsman c U Yadav b bowler 36(20) [4s-6 6s-1]"
3926,"out Caught by de Kock!! Oh dear. A teasing half-tracker, with generous width, asking to be slapped. Short does the needful, gets deep in the crease, lines up and throws his bat out in looking to cut it away. There's a hint of spit up, enough to grope a fat chunk on the top-edge. And Quinton's ever-so-sharp. batsman c de Kock b bowler 11(17) [4s-1]"
3927,"SIX, spots the length. It's that in-between one, and batsman makes it look worse. Swivels, pulls and heaves without bothering to keep it down. All brute"
3928,"FOUR, throws his hands out. He's already given himself width with his exposed stance. Swings, uppish and slices it with ease over point. Never mind the mistime"
3929,"FOUR, 137.7kph. Turns cheeky. Mohit tries to correct, getting the channel close to off, but batsman's not getting foxed. He stays back, arches and ramps it ever so late, teasing the man at short third"
3930,"FOUR, short ball, this time Yuvraj does not have time to react. The ball races away towards his right and into the fence"
3931,"1 run, fullish and outside off stump, batsman guides it towards point"
3932,"SIX, finally a maximum! The asking rate is up high, the runs weren't flowing and batsman gets a much needed six. Read the slower ball very early, moved across the stumps and waited for the short ball to come and smashed the ball into the backward square leg fence"
3933,"out batsman Run Out!! Mix-up and the captain fires a direct-hit from extra-cover. Look at him roar. team's best batsman on show thus far has been sent back. Massive setback. batsman drove this full ball straight to Ashwin at extra-cover and set off, Dhoni said no straightaway - probably because of the niggle on the lower back. But batsman had already covered a lot of distance and Ashwin's throw was spot on. batsman run out (Ashwin) 49(35) [4s-5 6s-1]"
3934,"SIX, that's why he eats those dots. He knows he can make up for it big time. Flighted delivery on the leg stump, batsman gets down on one knee and slog-sweeps it from the middle of the bat over square leg"
3935,"FOUR, he's muscled that! Look at that ball go so flat and one bounce into the wide long-off fence. Slower delivery outside off stump, batsman steps out and the ball sat up nicely for batsman to free his arms and smash"
3936,"FOUR, oh that's a timely hit! Slower ball on the shorter side, batsman made room, lost balance but managed to cut that nicely over cover-point and there's no protection in the deep. 12 off the over, 55 more needed"
3937,"FOUR, in the airrr, could be out, oh the fielder makes a mess of it. Low full toss, batsman slogs, should have been held at deep mid-wicket, Dagar the sub wasn't quick enough to move forward, he dived but let it pass. He's immediately moved out of that position"
3938,"SIX, oh that's gone a loooong way into the stands. Stand and deliver stuff! Full and in the slot, bowler goes for the yorker, misses the yorker by some mark and batsman gets under it to send it over deep mid-wicket"
3939,"1 run, that was a wide ball but batsman chose to have a swing at it, mistimed with one hand to long-off and that's fifty for the captain. No celebrations but he gets a big applause from everyone"
3940,"SIX, he's smoked that away, Jaddu! This is the second time he's hit a big shot despite being off balance. Slower delivery from bowler, batsman somehow connects and gets enough power to clear long-on"
3941,"1 run, oh he's missed a big hit here. Full and outside off stump, better of going over cover but knowing batsman, he believes in muscling the ball rather than lofting over cover"
3942,"out Caught by Ashwin!! That's mistimed and only goes as far as cover. Normal seam-up delivery, full again for a big hit, batsman wanted to go over long-off, sliced it high in the air and the team makes no mistake. Important thing is Dhoni has crossed over and will be on strike now. batsman c Ashwin b bowler 19(13) [4s-1 6s-1]"
3943,"SIX, smashedddd! Why are you not bowling slower balls bowler? Strange! Length ball, goodbye! You are asking for trouble. batsman actially felt some pain after launching this over deep mid-wicket"
3944,"FOUR, talk about presence of mind and there's batsman with a bit of deftness. Short ball with third man inside the ring, unbelievable from the bowler. batsman spots the field, just guides the ball over the infield to the third man fence. Sehwag smiles from the dug out"
3945,"SIX, can you believe it? An injured MS batsman has hit a six with one hand. Take a bow sir! Low full toss, no one at deep square, batsman backs himself, has an excellent willow in his hand and swings across the line and over the boundary line"
3946,"FOUR, he's squeezed this in the gap. There were three fielders behind square on the off-side - point, backward point and short third man, yet batsman finds the gap. Can't blame the bowler for bowling a wide yorker, he bowled to the field"
3947,"out Caught by Barinder!! Too cute, and that's never ideal. Mohit gets his line wrong, slipping into the legs, but he's neatly disguised this slower back-hander. batsman's fooled as he loads up and commits to swipe it, knowing there's nobody at fine leg. Goes through early, gets a fat splice and short fine pockets the balloon. batsman c Barinder b bowler 11(9) [4s-2]"
3948,"FOUR, all timing. Back, lining himself behind and drills it to mid-off's right. Ashwin isn't the quickest, manages a palm. The outfield isn't Punjab's ally either"
3949,"SIX, he's hit this all the way but it won't matter - full ball outside off stump, batsman lofts it to over long-off. team have escaped home by 4 runs. Oh these team games and run chases. They get so deep. You got to admire this man - MS batsman. Injured very early in the innings, takes some treatment, takes it upon himself and almost takes his side home."
3950,"SIX, roll back the clock - it's that batsman of the old. Sran goes short, eventually sitting up and batsman smokes, flat-batting it big into cow corner"
3951,"FOUR, on the charge, converts the length into his arc and on-tonks. Not the legs, but nobody's cutting this off with nobody in the vicinity of long-on"
3952,"out Caught by Barinder!! So damn ungainly. batsman sheds his grace, well you have to when you are chasing 200, ends up one-handed. So it was the knuckle ball, Tye's staple, batsman gets down the track in trying to dispatch it into long-off. Loses shape, loses timing, and Sran's there at mid-off, waiting to gobble up the skier. batsman c Barinder b bowler 12(10) [6s-1]"
3953,"FOUR, too straight. Never an ideal follow up delivery, never an ideal any delivery. batsman's quick to pounce, shuffles inwards and tucks, splitting the gap between the keeper and short fine"
3954,"FOUR, a heap of runs. A half-tracker, then the googly starting from middle and spinning well down leg. batsman isn't happy pocketing a wide, he reaches leg-sided, connects and heaves it into fine leg"
3955,"out Lbw!! bowler runs to appeal. He wants an LBW. But the umpire's given runs. When you are the skipper and the bowler, you don't consult anybody. We're upstairs. It started with batsman shuffling, exposing his stumps and sweeping. bowler smartly slips in the quicker one, bang in line with the stumps. UltraEdge shows no edge. And HawkEye shows it to crash into off. Massive review. Massive moment. batsman lbw b bowler 9(8) [4s-1]"
3956,"FOUR, drags the length down. Very defensively. batsman doesn't have time to pat things back tonight. He chases, hard, and powers it behind point"
3957,"FOUR, doesn't matter what spinner this is - it's a full toss, down leg. batsman's on a knee, sweeping, slogging, everything"
3958,"FOUR, oh the deft. Some width, batsman's surgical, waiting on it, shedding that brutal muscle, putting some nerves to use, dabbing it between point and short third"
3959,"FOUR, breaks the barrier of respect and drives it on the up, uppishly. Over cover and into the fence. The ball was in the zone and the batsman did not hold back to smack it away"
3960,"FOUR, ho ho ho!! That was creamed away. Length ball, dangling away and the batsman eases the cover drive away into the gap. The ball speeds away into the fence. Again the ball curved away but the neat footwork towards the line of the ball ensured the batsman had it covered. Action-packed start"
3961,"FOUR, leaning drive! Classical touch play with a big stride forward and the ball screams past cover for a four. Slightly flatter it might have been and the batsman got it away. That would help"
3962,"SIX, hit through the line and off she goes into the stands. Seam-up, half-volley on the stumps, Agarwal bends his back knee and smokes it over long-on. Off the meat of the bat"
3963,out Caught by Tahir!! Watto strikes! Removes his former team teammate. It was banged short by the Australian and the line was on leg. batsman went for the pull half-heartedly as he was slightly cramped form room and all he could manage was a top-edge that lobs straight to short fine leg. A dolly for Tahir. bowler has his arms aloft. End of a superb knock from 'Universe Boss'. batsman c Tahir b bowler 63(33) [4s-7 6s-4]
3964,"SIX, there's the trademark batsman shot! Flighted wide of off, Yuvi, with a huge back-lift, lofts it handsomely straight down the ground. The long-on fielder moves to his right, can only watch the ball sail over his head"
3965,"FOUR, picked the gap beautifully did batsman. Short ball at 123.6kph, batsman picked the length early. Stood tall and pummeled the pull between long-on and deep mid-wicket"
3966,"FOUR, follows the bumper with a yorker and batsman brings his bat down at the right time. Manages to get some wood off the cue end and the ball goes fine of the man at short third man. Bravo is appealing! For what? Bat before the wicket? Was clearly off the bat"
3967,"out Caught by Jadeja!! Agarwal holes out! A mistimed loft and he finds one of the safest pairs in the world. The leg-break on the stumps and Agarwal moved leg-side to go downtown. The bat face turned at the point of impact and hence lost his timing. Goes miles up in the air, but straight to RJ at long-on. batsman c Jadeja b bowler 30(19) [4s-1 6s-2]"
3968,out Lbw!! Aaron batsman is given OUT lbw. Back-to-back golden ducks for him. He has reviewed. That looked plumb. Let's see. Fair delivery. No bat. Three reds and he is outta here. Here's the comeback from team. It was the quick googly from bowler and batsman definitely didn't pick that. Presses forward to block and got rapped on the front leg in front of off. That's plumb. bowler is pumped. Runs with the arms aloft and slaps the team symbol with on his shirt. That's the passion with which he plays. batsman lbw b bowler 0(1)
3969,"FOUR, good shot to get off the mark. In-drifter, slightly errs in line. Too straight and batsman's wrists does the rest. Flicks it through mid-wicket"
3970,"out Caught by Dhoni!! The teamians go up, batsman starts to walk. Doesn't wait for the umpire's decision. The cross-seamed short ball from Shardul Thakur and that's the reason for the extra bounce. batsman read the length and line, but couldn't account for that tad extra bounce. Looked to ramp it towards third man and got a feather on it. MS won't drop those. batsman c Dhoni b bowler 20(13) [4s-2 6s-1]"
3971,"SIX, RJ runs across and palms it over the boundary rope. Hit his thumb - his bowling hand as well. Hope it's not serious. It was a full toss and batsman hacked it over mid-wicket. Jaddu covered a lot of distance and the momentum was taking him futher across. Stuck his left hand out, couldn't hold on, despite a jump"
3972,"FOUR, bad ball and batsman takes full toll of it. Length ball on the pads, tickled away fine to fine leg"
3973,"SIX, Vijay was waiting for the ball, but it goes over his head. A 62m six! Slightly wayward from Thakur. Short of a good length straying down leg, batsman stays deep and moves towards off to help it along its way. A superb pick-up shot over fine leg"
3974,"out Caught by Dhoni!! Dhoni catches and batsman has to walk back to the dressing room. That's not something we are used to. A shortish ball, slightly off-paced and batsman was back and across to pull it away. Top-edges and MS runs towards the square leg region to snaffle that. batsman c Dhoni b bowler 14(11) [6s-1]"
3975,"out Caught by Jadeja!! bowler is good. He is too good, specially at the death. It's the slower back of a length delivery from Bravo. batsman knew that was coming, still couldn't put it away. Went deep in his crease and went too hard on the pull. Mistimed to deep mid-wicket. Straightforward catch for RJ. batsman c Jadeja b bowler 29(17) [4s-2 6s-1]"
3976,"FOUR, short ball, bad ball and put away. The batsman was waiting for it and swats the pull away fine on the on-side for a four. Crisply timed and it ran away. batsman has run into a massive purple patch"
3977,"FOUR, drops the ball short and that is a sin! The huge bat of batsman comes down on it and swords the ball away past cover point for a four"
3978,"SIX, drop-kicked! Gone for a sixer. The batsman goes with the turn and muscles the ball over long-off for a maximum. batsman is up and away!!"
3979,"FOUR, did I sanity? Pardon me. Gayle's partner-in-crime joins the act and creams the full toss outside off away into the covers. The ball raced away into the fence"
3980,"FOUR, if it is power from one end, it is all grace from the other. The batsman leans into the drive and threads the ball away like a seasoned tailor. The man at mid-off had no chance even with the dive to his left. Superb bit of batting"
3981,"FOUR, edged and gone! Gone for a four. Dhoni does not go for it to his left. Should be classified as a chance even if it might have been touch and go. The slip was wide and the ball goes between the keeper and the slip for a four. That is a huge reprieve for batsman"
3982,"FOUR, team have not done their homework. That was short again and the batsman stays back to pull the ball away with a lot of control. The man at deep fine had no chance"
3983,"FOUR, short ball again, the batsman does not time the pull away. But he gets enough meat on it and sends it past mid-on for a four. Fifty up for team. All carnage at Mohali"
3984,"SIX, that is into a parallel universe from the universe boss. Length ball was like a dead meat and batsman picks the bones out of it. Over cow corner for a mighty six. That was poor bowling"
3985,"FOUR, crafty and controlled. The short ball, the batsman gets on top of it and guides it past short fine leg for a four. The man at short fine leg and deep square leg tried to cut it off but in vain"
3986,"FOUR, punched and K.O! That was actually a pile driver down the ground. Picks the short of length delivery and punishes it down the ground, uppishly, for a four past mid-off"
3987,"SIX, where are the seat belts? The batsman show is here. Full ball and the batsman hammers the ball over long-off for a huge six. This man has made a statement. A big one. 46 off 19 balls!"
3988,"FOUR, full toss on the pads and batsman adds four to his tally. That was clipped away and the slide from the man at deep mid is not good enough"
3989,"FOUR, fifty on team debut! The big boss is owning the evening. That was in the zone, too full and the batsman thumped it down the ground for a four. One bounce and it escapes into the fence. And look at the big man, he does the cradle act with both his arms. He is thrilled to bits"
3990,"SIX, unfurl the noise now! Slammed down the ground over long-off. Well flighted ball and the batsman spanks it over the fence. He ain't holding back. team are unstoppable"
3991,"out Caught by Dwayne Bravo!! That is a steal. Full toss outside off and the batsman chips the drive to cover. DJ Bravo takes it and breaks into a jig. For a moment he has forgotten about the damage done. That was a poor delivery but batsman got carried away and lifted the ball aerially for the man at cover, who was on the edge of the circle, to take it. team have a small ray of hope. batsman c Dwayne Bravo b bowler 37(22) [4s-7]"
3992,"SIX, comes down the track and lifts the ball away over long-on. The big hitting has spread like an epidemic. The intentions and the application was superb and in sync"
3993,"FOUR, sliced away! No respect for the veteran spinner and the ball races away into the fence. Man at sweeper cover had no chance"
3994,"wide, out Stumped!! Smart stumping from Karthik and the last match hero falls cheaply. Nicely bowled by bowler as well, he pre-empted that batsman was coming down the track and slid this one down the leg-side, batsman stepped forward, the momentum took him further ahead, he turned around in panic, but Karthik had by then removed one of the stumps. A cheap dismissal for batsman and Delhi have lost an early wicket. batsman st Karthik b bowler 1(3)"
3995,"FOUR, cracking shot, overpitched and well outside off, batsman leans forward and places it into the gap past cover-point, beat the man in the ring and rolled away to the fence"
3996,"FOUR, short, wide and four, batsman's eyes lit up as he saw the width, got on top of the bounce and cracked it square past point, no need to run for those"
3997,"out Caught by Nitish Rana!! The Daredevils have been rocked early, excellent ball from Russell, hit the deck hard and got the ball to deviate away from outside off, drew batsman into a limp poke, the edge was found and it was travelling quickly. Rana dived across to his left at first slip, went with both hands and holds on. batsman c Nitish Rana b bowler 4(3) [4s-1]"
3998,"SIX, that's been palmed over the ropes! Mavi, the fielder. Was a slow, flighted delivery. Slightly too full, batsman goes hard on the lofted on-drive and doesn't time it too well. Mavi moved to his right and probably didn't time his jump well. Gets a hand, but that's been parried away. SIX"
3999,"SIX, back-to-back sixes. Quicker delivery, too straight as well, that's been bludgeoned over deep mid-wicket with a mighty swing of the bat"
4000,"out Caught by Uthappa!! Tries to go for the third maximum on the trot and perishes. Hey bowlers, need a wicket? Bowl half-trackers. That's what Kuldeep did. He's bowled two and has two wickets. Was the short leg-break from the left-arm spinner, batsman spotted it and went deep in his crease. Pull too hard and loses his shape. Miscued and picked Uthappa at deep mid-wicket. A big wicket, this. batsman c Uthappa b bowler 47(22) [4s-3 6s-4]"
4001,out Bowled!! 100 IPL wickets for Sunil bowler! No reaction from the Caribbean; as usual. The off-break from bowler doesn't spin much. Goes straight and crashes into the off-pole. And what was Morris doing? He backed away a long way to loft it over covers. Missed it by a mile. Beaten on the outside edge. Seven down. batsman b bowler 2(3)
4002,"out Lbw!! batsman is given out lbw and he reviews. Fair delivery. No bat involved. The impact was just above the kneeroll in front of off. What does the ball-tracker say? Three reds and Shankar goes off taking the only review with him. DD are falling apart here, without a fight. Turns in from a short of length and beats Shankar's clip/flick. He wasn't forward as well. The umpire raised the finger quickly. batsman lbw b bowler 2(4)"
4003,"FOUR, more flight on this ball and batsman eyes the mid-wicket region. Swings hard and gets a fat outside edge that goes over the slip fielder. Runs away to the third man fence"
4004,out Caught by A Russell!! batsman departs. This was on the cards. He slogged from ball one and perishes. Chips down the track to smash the offie over deep mid-wicket. No timing whatsoever - courtesy the bat turned at the point of impact. Russell runs to his left from mid-wicket and pouches it with ease. batsman c A Russell b bowler 7(6) [4s-1]
4005,"out Caught&Bowled!! It's over. Flighted delivery attacking the stumps, batsman chips it straight back to the bowler. bowler gobbles it just above his head. Kolkata Knight Riders win by 71 runs. batsman c and b bowler 0(2)"
4006,"FOUR, change of pace from Mavi, but batsman spotted it well, waited on the short ball, rolled his wrists and helped it behind square on the on-side, beat short fine and raced away to the fence"
4007,"out Bowled!! First IPL wicket for Mavi and he's chuffed to bits. Short of a length and angling across the left-hander, batsman was cramped for room as he went for the cut, gets an inside edge and the ball clatters into the stumps. Mavi is pumped and so are team. DD in dire straits now. batsman b bowler 8(7) [4s-1]"
4008,"FOUR, much better from batsman, full and just outside off, batsman brings his bat down and drills it back past the non-striker. Mid-off is very wide and has no chance"
4009,"FOUR, batsman has been lucky in this innings so far, pitched up and well wide of off, he saw the width and threw his hands at that, slices it high and over cover, couple of bounces and over the ropes"
4010,"FOUR, just over cover and the small Eden Gardens outfield means it's a boundary for batsman. He backed away to a short and wide ball, had to reach out for the slap, didn't get it off the middle, but has enough to clear the infield"
4011,"FOUR, short, wide and four, no one moved after batsman flashed it behind square on the off-side, a poor ball and batsman took full toll of it"
4012,"FOUR, much needed for DD, very full and around off, batsman gets his left leg out of the way, brings his bottom-hand into play and drills it wide of mid-on, beats the fielder in the ring and rolls away to the fence"
4013,"FOUR, back-to-back boundaries for batsman, gets down low to a well flighted delivery outside leg, rolls his wrists and sweeps it behind square on the on-side for a boundary"
4014,"SIX, lovely, tossed up well outside off, batsman gets a good stride forward, picks the wrong 'un, opens the face of the bat at the last moment and sends it soaring over extra-cover for a maximum"
4015,"FOUR, this is excellent batting from batsman, bowler dropped this one short and just outside off, batsman makes room, lets the ball go past him and then cuts it square behind point for a boundary"
4016,"FOUR, cracking shot, full and well outside off, right in the slot for batsman as he drives it past cover, the fielder in the deep has no chance"
4017,"1 run, Curran shortens his length outside off, steered to the left of cover-point. batsman waits for the ball to pass the fielder and then jogs across for a single"
4018,"SIX, easy pickings for batsman, short and at his body, he gets inside the line, uses the pace on the ball and helps it way over the ropes at long leg"
4019,"FOUR, reverse sweep and four, flighted delivery outside off, batsman bends down half-way and then gets it past the keeper, no chance for short third man and the ball rolls away to the fence"
4020,"out Caught by Chawla!! Oh dear! We saw this yesterday for team, now batsman falls to a long hop. Dropped short and on the stumps, begging to be smacked, batsman swivelled across and nailed the pull, hard and flat - straight into the hands of Chawla at deep mid-wicket. The Eden Gardens finds its voice once again, batsman falls after an impressive knock. batsman c Chawla b bowler 43(26) [4s-7 6s-1]"
4021,"SIX, smashed, the back of the hand slower short ball from Curran, but it sat up to be smacked. batsman swivels across and pulls it high and way into the stands at long leg"
4022,"out Caught by A Russell!! That's a tame dismissal for Tewatia and the Daredevils have lost half their side. This was full and this was wide of off, Tewatia saw the opportunity for a few runs, got his left leg out of the way and was looking to smash it over cover. He went so hard that he lost all the poise and flow, ended up slicing it straight to Russell at short extra-cover. As easy as it comes. batsman c A Russell b bowler 1(2)"
4023,"SIX, off the mark with a six. That's what he can do. Can recover momentum and up the rate so quickly. This was a full delivery on the stumps, batsman connected well and sent the ball over wide long-on, he needed that for his own confidence and for the team's sake"
4024,"no run, bowler is jumping for an lbw appeal. Does not get it and Gambhir takes it. To the naked eye, looked like an under edge. Need UltraEdge to confirm. No bat. So we move on. Impact? Outside the line and that is such a poor review and DD burn their only review. Was very full to be sweeping, batsman went for it and managed to get himself outside the line"
4025,"out Caught by Roy!! Good catch by Roy at long-on and another set team batsman departs. Got under the full delivery too much - that's why couldn't get the elevation he wanted. It was the knuckle ball as well - something bowler has developed recently, it swings away too, coming to the catch, Roy made it look easy - that's because he judged it to a nicety and took it with both hands without breaking a sweat. batsman c Roy b bowler 31(29) [4s-4 6s-1]"
4026,"FOUR, right in between deep mid-wicket and deep backward square. The short ball sits up for batsman, who swivels on the back foot and though he pulls in the air, he hits the gap"
4027,"SIX, DK knows all about bowler. Both play together for Tamil Nadu, a step towards the ball and then swung it from his hips over deep backward square, was a back of a length delivery but such is the form that DK is in, he has hit it for six"
4028,"no run, DK has been given out lbw. By umpire Nand Kishore. Looks a dodgy decision. That's why the team skipper went for the review straight away. UltraEdge shows a big spike and the crowd cheer. Huge inside edge onto the pads. How did Nand Kishore miss that? bowler was pumped, but all that celebration now turns sour! Was a length delivery cutting back in, raps batsman above the kneeroll, but there was an edge before that"
4029,"FOUR, this is classy. Effortless batting by DK. Length delivery angling in to middle and leg, batsman flicks over mid-wicket and leaves deep mid a spectator"
4030,"FOUR, an action replay of the previous delivery. bowler just stares in despair. At DK who has flicked him again over mid-wicket. Sheer timing and nearly went all the way, one bounce over the ropes. What form he is in at the moment"
4031,"out Caught by Boult!! That is so poor from DK. No game awareness at all. Switched off at the wrong moment and didn't spot the change in field. Flicks and holes out to deep mid. Went for the same shot that got him two boundaries, but found the fielder. bowler raises his arms in delight and sports a big smile on his face. Had his man finally. batsman c Boult b bowler 19(10) [4s-2 6s-1]"
4032,"SIX, length delivery outside off and batsman launches it over long-on. Clean bat-swing and the ball sails over the fielder's head. The wicket of his skipper hasn't put batsman off at all"
4033,"SIX, that is a magnificent shot. For a moment he was cramped by the short of length delivery into the body, but he adjusted at the last moment and slashed it into his team's dugout at the third man fence. Needed to get it fine and did so"
4034,"2 runs, fantastic work by Roy from long-on, but he can't get to the ball, in fact gets a fingertip on that on the dive forward. A horrible miscue from Russell as he swipes at a slower delivery, got lucky as Roy had too much to do after sprinting forward. Isn't happy with that shot, slaps his thigh after completing the second"
4035,"SIX, holds the pose. Take that bowler seems to say Russell. Overpitched and right in teeing off zone for Russell, who lofts ever so cleanly and sees the ball till the last moment as his eyes and the bat are transfixed at the target. It lands in the long-off stands. Someone take a pic of that, frame it and present it to Russell"
4036,"SIX, he is unreal. When it comes to hitting a cricket ball. The predictable short delivery arrives, with no pace or height, brutalised over mid-wicket. The Kolkatans have gone mental at the Eden"
4037,"SIX, now batsman gets into the act. Short ball and batsman pulls handsomely over deep mid. Looked like he was waiting on the back foot for that one and when it came, didn't miss out"
4038,"FOUR, went for the short delivery again, but took the pace off it, sits up for batsman who slashes over point and beats sweeper cover running across"
4039,"SIX, that is the flattest square-driven six you'll ever see. Trust me on that. Unbelievable stuff from Russell. Sees the slower delivery outside off and gets low to carve it over deep point. The ball never took off from a height after it left the bat"
4040,"SIX, my word. There's so little margin of error against this beast from Jamaica. A man-mountain. bowler errs by slowing the pace down, lands right in the swinging range of Russell who sends it high into the deep mid stands. Such clean striking!"
4041,"SIX, straight up in the air, can someone get under this one. What! It has landed over long-off's head. What does he have everyday? Just pass that to all those who want to put on weight. This is jaw-dropping stuff from Russell. Looked like he had pulled the short ball straight up in the air, but such is the power he possesses that it has landed beyond the boundary. What more can I say?"
4042,"1 run, full on off, batsman looks to flick and the leading edge dribbles to backward point. 50 for batsman and it's his first one in team colors"
4043,"out Bowled!! Gone now. If anyone needed a sample of how to get Russell out, just watch this from bowler. No fuss or drama. The old-fashioned yorker - still gets you wickets even today. Will do so after 100 years as well. Just that you have to get it right. bowler did, slipped it under batsman's swinging bat and it clipped middle and leg. Superb bowling and that wicket could mean a difference of 20 at least to the eventual score. No big celebrations from bowler, just a fist pump. Replays show that it was delivered cross-seam as well. batsman b bowler 41(12) [6s-6]"
4044,"FOUR, goes short and batsman gets off the mark with four. On the body, pulled hard through mid-wicket and Gill finds the gap"
4045,"FOUR, this guy has talent. Make no mistake about it. Turns a near yorker into a boundary. Special skill when you can do that. Backed away a tad and directed it with an open face, just wide of short third, who didn't get across. Should've done better"
4046,"FOUR, how good is he with those cuts and carves on the off-side. Sits deep in his crease, waits for the full delivery and then at the last moment opens the face of the bat to drive in the air, there's a fielder placed exactly for that shot, but the ball bounces wide of him and speeds to the fence"
4047,"out Caught by Gambhir!! Deception from bowler and he dismisses batsman. The slower delivery just outside off, batsman this time scooped it straight up in the air and Gambhir tracked back from cover to settle under that. batsman c Gambhir b bowler 59(35) [4s-5 6s-4]"
4048,"leg byes, FOUR, poor delivery and deserved four. High full-toss sliding down leg, brushes the thigh pad of batsman and beats Pant's dive to his left. Runs away fast to the fine leg fence. bowler has been disappointing with the ball tonight"
4049,"out Caught by Chris Morris!! ""Catch it buddy"" shouted someone and it has been caught at point. All too simple really. Short and wide outside off, batsman fails to keep the cut down and gives Morris an easy opportunity inside the ring. batsman c Chris Morris b bowler 6(5) [4s-1]"
4050,"out Caught by Pant!! batsman comes and goes. Without scoring. Cleverly bowled by bowler, saw batsman charging out, pulled his length back, batsman skies the lofted hit straight up and Pant calls for it to take it. batsman c Pant b bowler 0(3)"
4051,"out Caught by Maxwell!! Tag-team work and batsman is gone. They are checking the height on this. But bowler is fine on that count. batsman didn't get bat on the last delivery, this one he gets a thick edge on the slash and Pant tipped it over the bar, but great anticipation from Maxi at slip who tracked back and pouched it. Alert mind and good cricketing nous from the Australian. Deserved wicket for bowler. batsman c Maxwell b bowler 1(4)"
4052,out Caught by Maxwell!! bowler is pumping his fist and punching the air. Three wickets in that over and just one run off it. Fantastic effort from the leggie. batsman too like Chawla charges the bowler and can only find long-on. batsman c Maxwell b bowler 2(3)
4053,"FOUR, that is smashed. Belted by batsman as he saw the short of length delivery outside off and didn't hold back. Went aerial over cover-point and gets four"
4054,"FOUR, he wants to go only one way - through the off-side. This is a good shot, hammers it hard and wide of extra-cover, who didn't dive. It was a quicker one and on the stumps, but batsman found the gap"
4055,"FOUR, shot. Slightly fuller than a good length on the stumps, batsman just biffed it over the bowler's head. Not a very good connection, but good enough to clear everyone. Breaks the shackles a bit"
4056,"FOUR, clobbered by batsman. bowler went round the wicket to cramp up the batsman, but provided the ideal length for the Aussie to hit, brutalised past the stumps at the other end. The ball was gone before bowler could stick his boot in"
4057,"FOUR, nearly holed out. But gets four thanks to Morris' fumble. At long-on. He went for the catch, but the ball bounced in front of him and since he didn't get his body behind the line of the ball, it runs away. Was a full-toss and batsman biffed that in the air"
4058,"SIX, heaved over deep mid. Sliding on, on the middle and leg line, batsman sunk under that and clouted it high and over mid-wicket"
4059,"SIX, sheer power. That's all made in the gym. What a shot this is. Must be contending for one of the shots of the tournament so far. This is a length ball on off, batsman went back and used his forearm power to great effect as he flat-batted it dead straight back over the bowler. A flat six. bowler shouldn't feel too disheartened with that hit, it wasn't a bad ball by any stretch of the imagination"
4060,"FOUR, drags it short, the arm-ball went wrong. Fired it outside off, batsman cuts that hard and eludes a diving cover-point to his left. As soon as he got it past the fielder, it was four"
4061,"SIX, slog-swept by batsman and six over deep square. Went down quickly and sheer timing on the shot sees the ball sail into the crowd"
4062,"out Caught&Bowled!! That is bowler's wicket. Full marks for slowing it down and getting purchase from the wicket, which brought about batsman's downfall. He had swept bowler last over for a big six over mid-wicket, but this turns slightly and the top edge goes straight up. This time into the hands of bowler. Just when batsman was looking dangerous he gets out. Has been the story of his life. batsman c and b bowler 35(19) [4s-2 6s-3]"
4063,"SIX, the slog-sweep from batsman and he has sent it over Morris' head at deep mid. Right in the range for that shot and Rana sent it into the stands"
4064,"SIX, comes down the track and launches into the lofted hit, gets good height and the desired elevation over deep mid. Clears the fielder"
4065,"FOUR, now shows his intelligence by sweeping wide of short fine leg. Knows deep square is too square and won't get there, got outside the line and knelt down to play the sweep well"
4066,"out Bowled!! What a cracker to start! It's a golden duck for batsman. A beaut from Umesh to begin, gets this to nip in a touch from a straightish off stump line. It was full and drew Suryakumar forward but he didn't anticipate the late movement. As a result, ended up playing around it and missed it completely. The woodwork is disturbed and up go the team players in jubilation. Umesh is absolutely pumped. batsman b bowler 0(1)"
4067,"out Bowled!! Got himmmmm, yess goneeee! Umesh is breathing fire I tell you. If the first one was a good nut, talk about this one! What a corker! Goes full and it's almost the ideal inswinger that lands around off, Kishan plays around it, quite like Suryakumar did and sees the off stump go for a walk. Fab sight for any fast bowler and Umesh is on a hat-trick now, folks! team have started this game with a bang. Pressure mounting on the hosts. batsman b bowler 0(1)"
4068,"FOUR, classy shot! He has been out of form but strokes like these should set batsman up nicely. Half-volley and not all that wide, but he leans nicely to caress the drive through the covers. Raced away to the fence in no time"
4069,"SIX, dumped over deep backward square leg! Doesn't take long for batsman to launch. Gets one that's fractionally short and he is on the back foot in a jiffy. Swivels to absolutely clobber the pull. Went deep into the stands"
4070,"SIX, he's done waiting for something deft. He's down, running, bowler's gone slower as well for some reason. Swings, big time, and it's more a miscue .. never mind when you've got hands like these. Way over long-off"
4071,"SIX, typically dragged down. batsman' smart, he sits, gets it in his slot and heave-sweeps. Checks the railway tracks behind square leg..the ball's there"
4072,"out Caught by de Kock!! And the twist comes from a stress-fractured off-cutter. They've realized there's no point in bowling your best ball, and Anderson smartly floats up a slower change up. batsman can't wait, he commits to a lofted slice, loses timing, has the ball grab the upper half of his bat and fly. Fly higher. Over Quinton, who's already messed up a few. He runs behind, under the swirl, comes back and collects. batsman c de Kock b bowler 65(42) [4s-6 6s-5]"
4073,"FOUR, rubbing insult. A nothing half tracker, drifting down leg and batsman loads up on the back foot, swivelling as he swats it powerfully behind square. One-bounced"
4074,"SIX, connects. Cleanly at last. And then it's going only one way. bowler tries a flipper, but Krunal with his shuffle gets under, sits under and dispatches it into long-on. Nothing subtle"
4075,"SIX, raw meat. That length, you are obliged to smack. batsman smokes, swinging flat-batted, into the first tier over square leg"
4076,"FOUR, now compensated with width too. The length stays short and friendly. batsman carves, doesn't even bother keeping it down, given how fine third man is. And yes, it's a fifty .. his first of this season"
4077,"FOUR, and now feeds the pads for some reason. Umesh's dealing in binaries here. Whipped away, typically bottom-handed, teasing fine leg"
4078,"FOUR, angling wide across. batsman in some form, he leans, frees up his hands, taking it head-on in hammering it square. Oh the way he opens up the face in slicing,check the leather!"
4079,"out Krunal Pandya Run Out!! 1 run completed. More running troubles. Anderson standing in the way and Krunal has to take a step away to ensure he doesn't collide again. Can't afford getting injured. Well the tournament can't afford anyone else getting injured, the replacements aren't leaving their Counties. Right, batsman smashed it down the ground, wants the strike. Pandya has to sacrifice. Hesitated for the second, stopped and takes the longer route. Alas, the dive is too late. Krunal Pandya run out (Woakes/bowler) 15(12) [4s-1 6s-1]"
4080,"FOUR, that short-wide combo. And batsman has no shortage of time on anything. Gets in line, angry bat, angry hands on the revenge from the run-out he's caused. And into deep point"
4081,"SIX, oh my. As if the half trackers weren't enough, the hospitality has stretched out to dishing out full tosses on the hips. All batsman has to do is impart direction and that's swiping it into fine leg. A railway tragedy wouldn't be far"
4082,"SIX, wow. Okay Google - search for descriptions. bowler errs for a change, letting the length sit up in batsman arc .. and that arc's ever-expanding. Flat-bats, high and into long-on. Save your faces"
4083,"out Caught by de Villiers!! Smart slower stuff. batsman never comfortable when he has to slog without getting set. Today's no different. Doesn't quite get his power right on the cutter that bowler digs into the pitch on length. Tries whacking it over long-on, but AB's there. And he's good to take it reverse-cupped. batsman c de Villiers b bowler 5(7)"
4084,"no run, a peach. Oh it doesn't get better. And to imagine it coming in the death in the midst of an onslaught. Oh and amidst all this noise, the umpire's heard a tickle. He's given him caught behind. But Pandya isn't amused, he goes up instantly. Why bother consulting your partner with 10 balls to go in the day. And UltraEdge is a murmur all through, but when it passes the bat it gets a little bigger. The sound's deaf. Oh and forget the spikes, the third umpire overturns"
4085,"SIX, feeds him a revenge gift. Short, on the body, and Pandya swivels, almost base-balling it into the second floor. Where else, but behind square"
4086,"SIX, and now length. The cardinal length. Pandya rubbing it in and how. Holds his pose, lets the ball get close and clears long-off with his lofted shovel"
4087,"FOUR, clears his front leg. Goes conventional. Full meat, over the bolwer, and trickling further in. Deadly death batting this"
4088,"SIX, makes him bowl a full toss. Misses the yorker, the dew isn't helping him either. And batsman doesn't need these, really. You don't have to be this kind. Carved away, deep extra cover"
4089,"FOUR, another juicy full toss. Oh dear. Oh dear. Flat-batted, heaving it downtown. Oh the bleeding, it's getting painful to watch"
4090,"out Caught by Woakes!! Real quick. Talk about timing even when you are getting out. batsman backs away, smacks it down long-on's throat. And it's so flat that Pandya can't even cross over. batsman c Woakes b bowler 94(52) [4s-10 6s-5]"
4091,"FOUR, wrong line and is duly punished. Short of a length and is down leg as well, cannot do that with fine leg in the ring. batsman swivels across for the pull and although it came off the inner half, was always a percentage shot. Beats the fielder in the ring comfortably and races away"
4092,"FOUR, finishing touches. Make it 21 off the over -- and Pandya's done it with a flash straight down. 213 it will be .."
4093,"FOUR, doesn't start well and on this pitch, there is little margin for error. Slightly short and a bit of width as well, batsman sits back and crunches it through the covers. Found the gap and the outfield did the rest"
4094,"FOUR, super shot! Sundar is being put under pressure here. Flatter and a touch short outside off, batsman waits on the back foot and punches this through the gap at backward point. Lovely stuff! Even Kohli cannot help but applaud the stroke"
4095,"FOUR, this is getting disastrous for the young off spinner but he has only himself to blame. Another fuller ball down leg, this time batsman doesn't fail to connect. Sweeps it very fine down the leg-side and past the fielder who was in the ring"
4096,"1 run, close shave for batsman! Didn't put in the dive and trusted his long reach to bail him through. The direct hit at the bowler's end did test him to be frank but the West Indian got through in the end, only just though. It was a nicely floated off break to start with, gripped a touch and forced a leading edge towards backward point. There was a slight stutter in the running before they eventually decided to go ahead with it. No harm done in the end"
4097,"SIX, welcome to the attack Mr.bowler! batsman is absolutely nonchalant as he dispatches this rubbish short ball way into the stands at deep backward square leg. At his pace, bowler needs to be careful about the lengths he bowls, especially in the Powerplay"
4098,"FOUR, bleeding runs here! This is a fab counterattack from these two and the team bowlers are wilting under the onslaught. Slower but short with a lot of width, allows batsman to chance his arms with a slap cut through backward point"
4099,"5 wides, poor from bowler and nothing much de Kock can do about the bad bounce. Tries the variation and it slips outside off, could say that the wide call was marginal but the uneven bounce means that de Kock couldn't get down in time. Races away to the fence"
4100,"FOUR, raining boundaries! Cannot understand this ploy though, back of a length outside off with third man in the ring. batsman stays back and glides it, just had to beat that man in the 30-yard circle and he does it with ease"
4101,"SIX, down the pitch and bang! The team skipper has decided to up the ante a little. Shimmies down the track on seeing the flight and the leg-stump line helped as well, launched into the stands at deep mid-wicket. Super shot"
4102,"FOUR, not Sundar's night at all. Another drag-on, leg-stumpish and these are easy pickings for batsman. Sits back and swivels across to clatter the pull to the deep mid-wicket fence. The offie has been unusually erratic so far"
4103,"SIX, that's hugeeeeeeeeeeeee! batsman continues on his merry ways. Picks the top spinner quickly and brings out the imperious slog sweep. Huge maximum over deep backward square leg. Brings up his 50! He is looking deadly tonight"
4104,"FOUR, how hard has he hit this one! Boy, that's some power from batsman. Charges down the track and makes room to create width. The length wasn't all that short but he clobbered it over cover. Rocketed away"
4105,"FOUR, does it again! batsman is determined not to let his former team teammate settle. Stays in the crease this time and just gets leg-side of the ball a touch before launching it inside out over extra cover. Delicious strokeplay!"
4106,"1 run, direct hit would have been close! Lewis was certainly in double but Mandeep's throw at the keeper's end misses by a whisker. Was a goner if it had hit. Wide yorker that was squeezed by batsman towards backward point"
4107,"FOUR, what a shot. bowler overdoes, overpitches and that's too easy for batsman. Gets forward, with a full face of the bat and creams it past mid-on. That boundary will ruin a decent over by bowler"
4108,"FOUR, is greeted to the crease with a boundary. Flighted on the stumps, batsman gets and sweeps. Gets it more off the top-edge but it sails over behind square. No-one there and they'll collect a boundary"
4109,"FOUR, uppish and through Pollard's hands at short mid-wicket. Trademark batsman whip. Clears his front leg and swats it off his pads. Pollard leaps but in vain. Races away to the boundary at deep mid-wicket"
4110,"FOUR, this is tripe. Gift packed and delivered to batsman. Flat and short outside off, batsman goes back and thrashes it through cover"
4111,"FOUR, lovely hit inside-out by Washi! The googly from bowler, seemed to have picked that from the hand, got a stride forward and lofted that beautifully over cover"
4112,"out Caught by Suryakumar Yadav!! He got smashed in the first over, but he's got three wickets now. The widish delivery across the left-hander, Sundar mistimes the lofted drive over cover, hits it high and straight to long-off. Celebration time for bowler. batsman c Suryakumar Yadav b bowler 7(8) [4s-1]"
4113,"FOUR, he's guided this in the gap past backward point and it's running away for four. It was the slower delivery outside off stump, Sarfaraz gets the placement right by opening the bat face at the last moment"
4114,"SIX, that's classic Virat batsman for you! Flighted delivery just outside off stump, batsman lofts the inside-out drive from the middle of the bat, hits the rope on the full. Stand and deliver stuff"
4115,"out Stumped!! Blind swinging from batsman. Advances and goes for an almighty swing, but bowler is clever enough to bowl this wide outside off stump and force the batsman to reach out, completely missed and Tare, the sub keeper, does the rest. batsman st (sub)Tare b bowler 5(6) [4s-1]"
4116,"1 run, fifty for VK, but he won't celebrate. Doesn't even raise the bat. Just nudges this length ball into the on-side and gets to the milestone"
4117,"FOUR, he's middled this alright, doesn't bother running! The off-cutter, batsman launches it over the bowler's head and beats long-on"
4118,"SIX, that's a lovely hit! Hit on the rise, the bat made a good sound as it made contact with the ball. Slower delivery again and batsman went straight towards the sightscreen"
4119,"SIX, take that! Short of a length delivery on the off stump, batsman shows no respect and pulls the ball handsomely over mid-wicket. Brilliant hit"
4120,"out Caught by Krunal Pandya!! Soft dismissal. Slower delivery outside off stump, batsman plays early and slices it straight to short third man. bowler gets his name into the wickets column to please himself and the ones who have taken him in their fantasy teams. By the way, that was bowler's 50th IPL wicket. batsman c Krunal Pandya b bowler 11(11) [6s-1]"
4121,"out Caught by Rohit!! Another one. Catching practice. They are checking for the no-ball. Oh no! More than half of his foot is inside the line. Why check that? It was a shortish delivery, Umesh slices the slog and skies it to cover. Hang on, the replay looks like it's not the wicket taking delivery. Umesh is at the non-striker's end. batsman c Rohit b bowler 1(2)"
4122,"SIX, cracking sound. Full and in the slot, batsman muscles that way back over the long-on fence"
4123,"SIX, oh he's connected this brilliantly! Give him a promotion next match! Slower delivery sat up nicely, batsman hangs back and pulls powerfully over deep mid-wicket and easily clears the fence. Will this make Kohli smile?"
4124,"FOUR, outside edge and third man is inside the ring, the ball flies over him as batsman goes hard on the attempted lofted drive. Can he get a hundred? 14 to get, 4 more deliveries to go"
4125,"SIX, down the one knee and smashed! Back in the crease with a step and then he picked the bones out of this slower delivery and sent it over long-on"
4126,"FOUR, su-sweet. Ends the over with a boundary. Juicy half-volley from bowler, well outside off. batsman isn't sparing those. Leans across, plants his front foot towards the ball and slashes it through extra cover. Beats a crowed off-side field"
4127,"FOUR, this wasn't timed as he would've liked, but batsman will still earn a boundary. The slower delivery from Fizz, batsman didn't pick it as he was through the shot early. Still managed to get enough wood to place it over mid-on. There's no stopping that"
4128,"SIX, batsman has found his bearings. Rahman errs, bowls it full on QDK's strong zone. Just bent forward and lifted it through the line. Ah, all timing as it sails over the ropes over mid-on"
4129,"out Bowled!! And call it the text commentator's curse. bowler snuffs out batsman and Wankhede erupts. Nothing shot from batsman. It was full and a semblance of tail back in. The batsman stepped forward and swung, completely down the wrong line and enough gap for the ball to sneak through to knock the off-stump. team lose their first wicket. batsman b bowler 19(12) [4s-2 6s-1]"
4130,"out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! batsman perishes. Huge blow for team. Two wickets in the over and bowler is turning it on here. Seemed like a certain ploy and batsman fell into the trap. Dug in short and there was a fielder positioned at deep mid-wicket. AB forgets, goes for the pull, doesn't bother to keep it down either. Flat and straight to Hardik, who cupped it. Straight down the gullet, didn't even had to move there. team on top. batsman c Hardik Pandya b bowler 1(2)"
4131,"FOUR, edgy but looked like it was intentional from batsman. The slower ball from Rahman, ends up as a wide yorker. batsman digs with an open bat face, runs it more off the outer half and it beats short third man"
4132,"FOUR, cracked. Rohit isn't happy, asks Rahman to bowl towards the stumps. Fizz overpitches and offers it outside off, minimal effort from batsman. Shifts his weight forward and caresses the drive that beats extra cover"
4133,"1 run, fired it in quick on off, batsman pushes it to the right of Rohit at extra cover, who swiftly moves across and releases the throw in one motion. Hits the target but batsman's makes it in by dragging his bat"
4134,"out Caught by (sub)Duminy!! Anderson departs for a blob. Not a sweet IPL 2018 debut for the Kiwi all-rounder. Pandya gets two in two. Slowish and lured Anderson into a big shot. The batsmen went low and slogged, no timing whatsoever and he ended up hitting it straight to deep mid-wicket. Pandya is chuffed, so are rest of his team-mates. team digging a hole for themselves here. batsman c (sub)Duminy b bowler 0(1)"
4135,"wide, out Stumped!! Once bitten twice shy. No mistake whatsoever from Ishan Kishan this time. batsman has been hokey-pokeyed for the second time and no repreive on this occasion. Very smart from Krunal; batsman announced his intent of stepping out early. Krunal sees it and lasers it wide of off. Very similar to the last over, Ishan Kishan doesn't panic, grabs it cleanly and whips the bails off. team lose their third wicket. batsman st Ishan Kishan b bowler 16(14) [4s-1]"
4136,"out Bowled!! Duck for batsman! Couldn't have been a better start for the Royals, this. Lynn not having a great time, dropped a catch earlier and departs without troubling the scorers. It's a short delivery and with a bit of off-spin, Lynn goes back to cut and gets undone due to the lack of bounce and spin on that. No Lynn special tonight and the crowd at Jaipur erupts. batsman b bowler 0(2)"
4137,"FOUR, edged but safe! A short delivery around off, too close to cut and batsman goes ahead with the shot. Gets a top edge that eludes the leaping keeper and finds the fence. Lucky to be still out there, but this is how he plays"
4138,"FOUR, low full toss outside off, Rana puts bat to ball and it skims away through the covers. Didn't go too hard on the drive, just focused on timing which was spot on"
4139,"FOUR, bowler darting them in real quick - 95kph this one. Rana goes back, uses the pace of it and tickles it nice and fine. Bit too straight this one from round the wicket"
4140,"out Caught by Stokes!! Superb catch at the boundary from Stokes, showing great awareness here. It was drilled back hard by batsman, and Stokes had plenty to do at long-on. Initially, he had to take a brilliant overhead catch while making sure that he times his jump nicely. And then he had to toss the ball back in as his feet were going to encroach the cushions. He judges the situation to a nicety and the execution is spot on. batsman c Stokes b bowler 48(36) [4s-6 6s-2]"
4141,"FOUR, oh lovely. He's already showing some excellent touch out there. 102kph delivery from bowler, batsman stays back to it and then dabs it out of the keeper's gloves. So so late and really really fine"
4142,"no run, slower length ball on off, Rana defends back towards the bowler and sets off for a single. Ridiculous judgement. Karthik obviously sends him back, but even a dive wouldn't have saved him if bowler had hit the stumps direct. Michael Clarke calls it the worst attempted single in the history of cricket"
4143,"SIX, oh what a freebie, and what a time for it. Any pressure that had built on team has evaporated. Slower short ball on leg-stump, batsman whip-pulls it witheringly over the long leg boundary"
4144,"SIX, pretty full from bowler, and this is brilliant use of the crease from Rana. He takes a step back which allows him to get under the ball. Mid-off was up in the ring, so the idea was to just loft it over him. And despite the bat turning in his hands, it still clears the ropes"
4145,"FOUR, full toss outside off, 144kph, batsman carves it away through backward point. Rocketed off his bat"
4146,"2 runs, an inswinging slower ball on middle and leg, Rana clears his front leg and drives to the right of long-off"
4147,"SIX, hoisted over long-on to wrap up a clinical win for team. Set himself up for this length ball and launched it into the night sky, falls way back into the stands"
4148,"FOUR, showed glimpses of form in the previous game too. This is short around off, batsman camps back and punches it well past the fielder at mid-off, placement was bang on there"
4149,"FOUR, finally manages to get a boundary. Was trying it since a while. This was a tad on the slower side but short enough for batsman to thrash it, goes aerial over covers and finds the boundary, his first convincing shot of the day"
4150,"FOUR, this was even better than the previous one. No fielders moved, just mere spectators. Short of a length outside off, batsman throws his hands at it and times his drive through the gap there, that came right from the meat"
4151,"FOUR, hat-trick of boundaries. Kulkarni put under pressure by batsman. Picks the length early on that short one, transfers his weight on to the back foot and pummels it through mid-wicket, the fielder there was too square to cut this off"
4152,"FOUR, pulled away! Short of a length on middle and leg, batsman picks the length on it and pulls it neatly over mid-wicket, on a bounce and over the fence there"
4153,"FOUR, slower delivery and that's been put away to the fence again. Just outside off and on a length, batsman stands tall and pumps it right over the bowler's head"
4154,"FOUR, cheeky. That's batsman's experience for you. Shortish in length around off, batsman simply guides it down to third man and finds the fence again, can't keep a fielder so fine"
4155,"FOUR, poor line! Can't bowl such freebies when a batsman is in good touch. This was a shortish delivery on the thigh and all batsman wanted to do is get it past the fielder at short fine leg, manages to do so. Drags it past the fielder and gets another boundary"
4156,"SIX, 50-run stand up between batsman and Uthappa! Short of a length around off, batsman clears his front leg and pulls it over mid-wicket to end the powerplay with a maximum. Good recovery by team after the loss of Lynn in the first over of the innings"
4157,"SIX, short and punished! Gopal drops it short on off, batsman camps back and times his pull over mid-wicket, an impressive blow"
4158,"FOUR, another edge, another boundary. On a length around off, batsman goes hard at it and gets an outside edge that makes it fly past the keeper. Even a dive by Buttler wouldn't have helped his cause"
4159,out batsman Run Out!! Poor piece of running there. First of all he tried to reverse sweep it and as it went off the pads to short third man. batsman wanted the run but Uthappa sent him back. There was no chance that Uthappa would have completed the run. Unadkat is the man who throws it at the keeper's end to catch batsman well short of his crease. batsman run out (Unadkat/Buttler) 35(25) [4s-5 6s-1]
4160,"SIX, a biggie to end the over! Excellent timing on that. Full and floated on middle, batsman doesn't miss out on the chance to slog it over mid-wicket, a meaty blow that was. That'll spoil the over for the bowler"
4161,"FOUR, misfield by Unadkat and bowler isn't pleased by that. Was a back of a length delivery outside off, batsman went for it with hard hands, threw his bat at it and got an outside edge. Unadkat slips at square third man and misfields as the ball goes through him"
4162,"FOUR, well-timed and four. Sliding down and batsman didn't miss out. Short fine was inside the ring and deep square back, he beat the latter with a beautiful flick off the hips. That should hopefully get him going"
4163,"FOUR, this is another short-arm jab, one bounce over the ropes at deep square. Way too short by bowler, on middle and leg, batsman picked him off easily, bisected the two men either side on the leg-side"
4164,"FOUR, this is so unlike bowler. He hasn't looked himself tonight. Another drag-down, batsman controls the pull and beats Mavi to his left at deep mid. 10 off that over"
4165,"SIX, what a blow that is. This is what batsman can do. Backs away and bowler follows him with a back of a length delivery, but batsman clobbers the pull miles into the deep square stands. At one point looked like clearing the crowd and going out of the stadium"
4166,"FOUR, he can do finesse too. Not only raw power. Used the pace of bowler to full effect. Watched the back of a length delivery onto his bat and steered it to the right of the diving backward point, beats him and gives third man no chance"
4167,out Bowled!! batsman's painful innings comes to an end. A fist pump from bowler. Bowled the slider and it rushed past the cross-batted hoick of batsman. Clipped off and credit to DK for getting bowler back on. The bowler has justified that move with another wicket. batsman b bowler 44(43) [4s-5 6s-1]
4168,"FOUR, this is a proper pull. Dragged down by bowler and batsman was onto the back foot in a flash, pulled it between wide long-on and deep mid. Found the gap to perfection. Hit hard as well"
4169,"out Caught by A Russell!! Good catch by Russell at short cover. Leapt at the right time to catch. batsman went inside out but couldn't keep the in-to-out shot down, bit more elevation and he would've got a couple at least. batsman c A Russell b bowler 15(11) [4s-2]"
4170,"SIX, as soon as he saw the tossed up delivery, a chinaman, batsman goes downtown. Kneels down and then slogs it miles back into the long-on stands. That's what batsman can do"
4171,out Caught by Nitish Rana!! bowler has bowled very well tonight and gets the dangerous batsman out. To the left-hander he has been bowling mainly googlies and this one is the same as well. batsman was charging bowler and it kept on going away from him. Sliced it high up in the air and Rana backtracking from cover takes a good catch. Not easy to judge that in the lights. batsman c Nitish Rana b bowler 14(11) [6s-1]
4172,"SIX, can Gill get there? He can but can only parry it over the ropes. Good effort from him running to his left at long-off. Not easy at all as batsman lofted it superbly after using his feet. Had enough to get it over the left-hand of the diving fielder"
4173,"FOUR, brutal. Fraction short and that's enough for batsman, who marmalises the back foot forcing shot. Long-off wasn't even in the picture. A rare off night for bowler"
4174,"out Caught by Shivam Mavi!! Easy for backward point. Back of the hand slower delivery, bowler bowls that well. He is so confident with that delivery that he regularly and surprisingly bowled it in the Ashes Test. To not great effect it must be said. But here he gets batsman slicing it off a thick outside edge and grabs a wicket. batsman c Shivam Mavi b bowler 12(7) [6s-1]"
4175,"out Bowled!! Both Karnataka men gone in consecutive balls. To bowler. He takes off his aeroplane and Mitch Johnson is seen clapping from the dugout. Pacy length delivery, on off, batsman was late on the defence and it knocked the stump out of the ground. Played a bit inside the line and had no footwork to deal with that sharp delivery. bowler is now on a hat-trick. batsman b bowler 0(1)"
4176,"FOUR, slightly off-line and four. Can't err in any way to batsman. Low full-toss and swung to the left of long-on, one bounce over the ropes"
4177,"1 run, Lynn at backward point drops a simple catch. Kulkarni sliced it and Lynn drops it. What's more it brings Buttler on strike too"
4178,"out D Kulkarni Run Out!! 1 run completed. Almost a royal mess-up. But bowler recovers to run Kulkarni out. Driven to long-off. No way the second was on, not with Kulkarni running like that. bowler fumbled the throw but recovered to run Kulkarni out, who couldn't make it. But importantly batsman will be on strike. D Kulkarni run out (Shubman Gill/bowler) 3(3)"
4179,"FOUR, first ball from bowler and batsman takes the seam-up delivery and sweeps it through backward square leg, hit well and found the gap too"
4180,"FOUR, lovely batting. Down the track and to the pitch before slamming it in the air, but wide of the diving Russell at mid-off. Consecutive boundaries"
4181,"FOUR, three in a row. Too short outside off, batsman has played around with bowler's mind. Takes full toll of this, by cutting this wide of point and cover-point"
4182,"FOUR, four more. This is brilliant batting. Without any risk too. That's 16 runs off the over. The last two balls have been short, even though this bounced from a back of a length, batsman was back and across, cuts again and does so well, to find the gap between point and cover-point. An injection of momentum, so badly needed by team"
4183,"SIX, smashed. That's some way to treat a bloke who's bowling at over 140 clicks. Down the track and flat-batted the short of length delivery straight back over the bowler's head. Had enough on it to go all the way"
4184,"FOUR, first one he has timed tonight. Picks the slower delivery from a length and swings cleanly over mid-off's head"
4185,"FOUR, magnificent cover drive. When batsman is on song, there are few better timers of the ball in India. This is overpitched and he leans forward to caress the drive wide of cover and extra cover. Threaded the needle there"
4186,"FOUR, sliding down, just needed bat on that and batsman gets the glance going. Fine leg is too square and he had no chance"
4187,"out Stumped!! Brilliant from DK but felt that batsman gave up all too easily. Could've put pressure on DK by attempting to dive, none of that and he goes. Was down the track looking to flick, richocheted off the pad and went in front of DK who calmly collects the ball and then backflicks to hit direct. One glove was off quickly and that made it easier for DK. Can't understand why it has been changed to stumped. According to the laws of the game, when a batsman is attempting a run - batsman surely was - it should be declared run-out. Weird! batsman st Karthik b Rana 36(19) [4s-5 6s-1]"
4188,"FOUR, he attempted that off the first ball and missed. Not now. Uses the pace of bowler to great effect. Steers late and with an open face, right off the middle of the bat and Uthappa running around from third man can only watch it run away"
4189,"out Caught by Kuldeep Yadav!! Gone now. As soon as he hit that, batsman knew he had made a mistake. Good short of length delivery on the hips, rising, batsman cannot keep the short-arm jab pull down and picks out deep square to perfection. Kuldeep didn't move a muscle there. batsman c Kuldeep Yadav b bowler 7(8) [4s-1]"
4190,"leg byes, FOUR, bonus runs! batsman checks his back a bit as that had struck him above the thigh pad. Back of a length around leg, he missed the flick off the back foot and it sped past a diving Saha to the fence"
4191,"out Caught by Deepak Hooda!! Such a soft dismissal! Often been the story with Agarwal, gets a good looking start and then weirdly, throws it away. Slower ball from Kaul and it was a bit short, Agarwal was in two minds whether to go hard at it or just use his touch. In the end, all he managed was to spoon it straight to Hooda at backward point. A dolly that is and once again, team get a wicket at just about the right time. batsman c Deepak Hooda b bowler 18(9) [4s-2 6s-1]"
4192,"SIX, ""Will he catch it? Yes, he will! No, he won't!"", yelps Mbangwa on-air! Good effort by long-off but too difficult in the end. Pandey was the man there, leapt to take it one-handed but the momentum was taking him past the ropes and in the effort to throw it back into play, fails to do so. Floated ball and was lofted down the ground by Karun, gets a maximum"
4193,"SIX, he has got under this one, oh yes! bowler was trying to steer clear of batsman's arc but misses it for once. Full and on middle and off, the big West Indian just clears his front leg and launches it over long-on for yet another six"
4194,"1 run, slower and very full on the pads, nudged towards the big spaces at mid-wicket. bowler has to chase it himself and that allows the single. 23rd IPL fifty for batsman, second on the trot to start a new season. The Jamaican is making a statement, that's for sure"
4195,"SIX, not off the middle really but who cares? He has enough power! The googly and batsman decided to go with the turn, sliced it away over long-off and easily cleared the fence! Whoa!"
4196,"SIX, this is off the middle alright! batsman storm alert! The shorter length and batsman sits on the back foot to flat bat it straight down the ground. As straight as an arrow and well over the ropes"
4197,"SIX, 3 in a row! Has Rashid ever been hammered like this? I cannot remember at all but this is what batsman does. He can destroy the best of bowlers. Fuller length once more and he just lifts it straight down the ground. Into the sight-screen! He is in the savage mode"
4198,"SIX, it keeps coming! It keeps coming! 4 out of 4 for batsman! Floated up on middle and off, he gets across on one leg and clobbers the slog sweep over deep mid-wicket for a maximum. Oh boy, this is some exhibition!"
4199,"2 runs, mistimed but clears mid-wicket with ease! Short of a length around middle and leg, drags this flick off the inner half and clears the infield"
4200,"FOUR, up and over! Good batting from Karun, saw mid-off up in the ring and decided to go over the man. Succeeded easily. Fuller ball outside off,"
4201,"FOUR, does it again! This time, Jordan at mid-off thought he had a chance and leapt full length but the ball sailed over him. Short of a length outside off, Karun flat-batted it with all the power and although he didn't keep it down, didn't matter at all. Runs bleeding at the moment"
4202,"SIX, bowler doesn't get the landing rights in Mohali. The slower delivery, bowls it half-way down the pitch. Seemed as though batsman was waiting for it. Rocks back and bulldozed it into the deep square leg stands. ""Catching practise for the crowd,"" says Pommie Mbangwa on air. 14th maximum for the universe boss"
4203,"FOUR, mid-off inside the ring and bowler bowls it right in the arc for batsman. He just gets under it and tonks it with a straight bat and clean swing over mid-off. Beautiful hands from batsman. Ah, poses for the paparazzis as well"
4204,"out Caught by Dhawan!! batsman targets the longest boundary and holes out. bowler gets his man, finally. Length delivery just outside off, batsman moved across and whiplashed it. Needed to generate more power to clear the ropes. Fails and hits it straight to Dhawan at deep mid-wicket, who grabs it and does the thigh-five celebration. batsman c Dhawan b bowler 31(21) [4s-3 6s-1]"
4205,"SIX, batsman moves to 99. Spoils a good over by bowler. Pitched up just outside off, batsman spots it early and smokes it disdainfully over long-off. High and handsome"
4206,"1 run, put your hands together for the universe boss! Christopher Henry batsman brings up his 6th IPL hundred. Off comes the helmet, raises his bat to soak in the applause from the Mohali crowd and unleashes the 'Baby in the arms' celebration. Reached the landmark with a squeezy drive to point"
4207,"1 run, oh this was nearly a run out! A highish full toss miscued to extra cover, who with a direct hit could have gotten batsman. Throw is right on cue to Kaul but he's not in a position to under-arm the ball onto the stumps. Chance missed, batsman makes it back in..."
4208,"FOUR, batsman gets into the act. Backs away, makes room and Rashid helped him by slanting it on the stumps. Golf-swung over cow corner"
4209,"SIX, Rashid has been taken to the dry cleaners today. Proper pasting. Went too full this time does Rashid, batsman was waiting for it. Muscles it straight down the ground"
4210,"FOUR, elegant shot! The flourish of the bat was a sight to behold. Knuckle ball from bowler but too full and also too straight as well, batsman shuffles a touch to flick it away sweetly. Bisected mid-on and mid-wicket with ease. Yusuf gave a chase but was never going to stop it even with the slide"
4211,"no run, good use of the technology by batsman! He was very sure that he had hit it and UltraEdge confirms the inside edge. He was stuck on the crease to this inswinger and got pinged on the back leg. Cannot fault the umpire for raising his finger because if not for the edge, it was dead plumb"
4212,"SIX, crunched! The big man kicks off the six-hitting for the night. Expected the short ball and was ready on the back foot, swatted the pull over mid-wicket. Made a cracking sound off the blade"
4213,"FOUR, on the off-side now! Fuller ball on middle and off, batsman is sensing the lengths early and backs away for the loft over cover. Carved it away over the infield with ease. He is getting into the groove"
4214,"SIX, hammered into the stands! That's a bad ball to most players, let alone batsman. Juicy full toss and he just blasts it away over deep square leg for a mammoth biggie. Clean strike"
4215,"SIX, smashed over long-on! Huge test this for Rashid, batsman is in the mood to destroy him tonight. Loopy leg break and it's too full, launched down the ground for another huge biggie"
4216,"FOUR, shot of the night so far! This guy makes batting look really simple, doesn't he? Fuller ball and batsman got the stride forward nicely before absolutely creaming the drive. On the up and what stood out was the precision in placement, bisected extra cover and mid-off with such ease"
4217,"FOUR, over the infield this time! batsman also joins in the fun. Another half volley from Kaul and this is lofted straight over mid-off. Comfortably over the fielder and away she goes to the fence"
4218,"1 run, saw batsman giving the charge and smartly shortened the length around middle and leg, eased away down to long-on. 50 up for team"
4219,"out Lbw!! Rashid draws first blood! team needed this and not surprisingly, it's their star spinner who does the job. The slider that shoots through a touch low, batsman wasn't anticipating the lack of bounce and went through with a pull. Got pinged on the pad and that's as plumb as it gets. End of a smooth opening stand but team haven't really been allowed to get away. batsman lbw b bowler 18(21) [4s-3]"
4220,"SIX, booooooom! Cannot bowl it in his arc when he is in this mood. Full and in the slot on off, he just lofts it down the ground effortlessly. Crashes into the sightscreen"
4221,"FOUR, almost carried to backward point! Reprieve for Agarwal, he went after this flighted delivery on seeing the width but couldn't connect the drive well. Sliced it in the air and it just fell short of the diving fielder. Sneaked past him eventually and sped to the fence"
4222,"FOUR, beautiful placement! Tossed up generously from bowler but it's too wide and Agarwal executes the inside out lofted stroke with finesse. There was a man at long-off but he's got this well wide of that man"
4223,"SIX, clobbered away! Agarwal is wasting no time in switching to top gear. Floated up around off, he just clears his front leg and deposits this over the long-on fielder for a maximum. Good proactive batting"
4224,"no run, Punjab have gone for a review. My naked eyes tell me this is high and it might be going down the leg side. batsman is jumping in the crease when ball strikes him on the back pad. It is clipping the stumps -- the top of middle and leg -- but just clipping so it is umpire's call and Punjab retain their review. Good inward shape from bowler on that back of a length ball"
4225,"FOUR, we have seen brute power from gayle earlier but this is total touch play from batsman. It was a good length delivery outside off, batsman gets in a good position and drives it on the up, ball beats the mid-off fielder for a four"
4226,"FOUR, picks up the slower ball early but doesn't time it as well as he would have liked, but he gets enough bat onto it to get a four to fine leg"
4227,"out Bowled!! batsman wasn't timing it at all and this was always on the cards. It was a good length delivery at the stumps, batsman wanted to play it across the line, his willow misses it totally and ball disturbs the furniture. Punjab are off to a dream start here. The ball just brushes the off stick. batsman b bowler 6(7) [4s-1]"
4228,"FOUR, 50-run stand up. Goes for the yorker but he's bowled a nice little full toss here -- something that batsman uses to hit his first boundary. Scythed round the corner, that full toss"
4229,"FOUR, room offered outside off and batsman's sliced it without fuss to the third man boundary. That will do"
4230,"SIX, some turn on this leg break but batsman stays put and swipes this over deep mid-wicket. Just a little short, which allowed batsman to go against the spin there"
4231,"1 run, back to off breaks, is bowler. batsman slaps it to sweeper cover to hoist a fifty"
4232,"FOUR, 129ks on a back of a length, and veering down, there's only one way the ball's going. To the boundary. Pulled behind square"
4233,"out Caught by Finch!! batsman will now know that this is a big, big ground. Steps out to a slower delivery -- knuckle ball, actually -- but can you blame him? Mistimes this attempted loft and there's long-off waiting, secretly thanking the big dimensions that this ground entails. batsman c Finch b bowler 54(41) [4s-3 6s-2]"
4234,"FOUR, deftly played. Googly but it's wide, and batsman waits and glides it just wide of the keeper"
4235,"out Caught by (sub)Manoj Tiwary!! That's been hit high but team here are unravelling, surrendering to Mohali's big dimensions. Knuckle ball, another one yeah, and batsman finds long-on with this big loft. Manoj Tiwary there, who takes it and then kicks the ball away in celebration... batsman c (sub)Manoj Tiwary b bowler 5(5)"
4236,"no ball, FOUR, that's above the waist, and hence a no-ball. batsman nicely arches away before realizing that he can get some bat on this. Glides it uppishly through third man"
4237,"SIX, a 37-ball fifty for Pandey. 40 from 10 needed now, which means literally every ball has to be a boundary. A bottom-handed loft from batsman that, getting under that full ball and launching it over long-on"
4238,"SIX, switches to the off break and batsman launches him over deep mid-wicket. Just the length you can swing across"
4239,"SIX, another one pretty much there. A bit slower you'd think, and batsman goes straighter here"
4240,"1 run, dropped by Mujeeb at deep mid-wicket. bowler actually did well by spinning it into batsman but batsman's in that mood. Carved across the line, only to be let off. That's the long side of the boundary and that should have been taken"
4241,"FOUR, Ashwin mistimes the jump and ball goes over him at mid-off for a four. It was fuller length ball at the stumps, Pathan lofts it over mid-off, just gets enough blade on the ball to clear mid-off"
4242,"1 run, what are you doing Yuvi! He drops a sitter. This is as easy as they come. Pathan mistimes the cut shot and he hits it straight to cover point where Yuvi makes a mess of it. Reacted very late as he went reverse-cup style and it popped out"
4243,"FOUR, slower delivery at the stumps, it was fuller in length and Pathan picks up the slower ball early. He gets in a good position and hits it over mid-wicket for a four"
4244,"FOUR, no one moved on that ball. It was a good length delivery outside off, Pathan swats it wide of the mid-off fielder for a four. Power and placement from Pathan"
4245,"out Bowled!! Chops it back onto the stumps. This is a back of the hand slower ball from bowler and Pathan was completely foxed by it. He wanted to drive it through the off-side but gets a thick inside edge and ball comes back in the direction of the stumps. Clever variation in pace from bowler, he is having a good night thus far. batsman b bowler 19(13) [4s-3]"
4246,"FOUR, gorgeous shot! Pure class from batsman. It was a leg-spinner from bowler, batsman comes down the track and lofts it with the turn over cover for a four. One of the toughest shots to play but he reached the pitch of the ball and made it easier for himself"
4247,"SIX, batsman sends it into the crowd. It was an off-spinner from bowler, batsman comes down the track, reaches the pitch of the ball and lofts it over the long-off for a maximum. Clean connection!"
4248,"no run, Punjab have gone for a review. batsman is a long way down the ground. Ultra edge shows no edge and DRS shows ball is just hitting the leg stump. Punjab retains the review again. batsman comes down the track on the ball and misses the bat totally, ball hits his pads"
4249,"FOUR, he won't miss out on that, will batsman! Waits for the slower delivery, rocks back and pumps it right over the bowler's head to get off the mark in style"
4250,"FOUR, that's bread and butter for Watto. Back of a length delivery outside off, batsman camps back, transfers his weight on the back foot and crunches this through the gap at covers, no fielder moved there"
4251,"1 run, edged and dropped! Rahul Tripathi the culprit on that occasion. Puts down a sitter. Was a full length delivery outside off, batsman goes for a drive and the away swing induces an outside edge. However, Tripathi - the lone slipper makes a mess out of it"
4252,"FOUR, who would want to be a bowler in this format? Dropped catch just on the previous ball and this one has been belted away. Full in length outside off, batsman advances down the wicket and smokes it over cover for a boundary"
4253,"SIX, first maximum of the match! Loopy delivery around off, batsman backs away, makes room and towers it cleanly over long-off for his first big one of the night"
4254,"FOUR, these runs are hurting Royals, really bad. Both batsmen are looking unstoppable. Shortish delivery on leg, batsman swivels his pull past the fielder at short fine and ends the over with a boundary again. How often has that happened tonight!"
4255,"FOUR, the boundaries continue to flow.. Room to leg and that opens up the off-side field nicely for him, even though it is back of a length, batsman thumps it on the up over extra cover. No chance for the sweeper"
4256,"SIX, flat six! That barely left the ground. Banged in and at bowler's pace it sat up for Watto, who was quick to rock back and nail the pull in front of square, right between deep square leg and deep mid-wicket"
4257,"FOUR, streaky! But that's how batsman plays. No half measures. Darted in outside off and batsman threw his bat at that, sliced the drive over backward point and started another over with a boundary"
4258,"FOUR, fabulous shot! It was the wrong 'un and batsman picked it right out of the hand. Got into position to play the inside out shot and struck it handsomely over extra cover. The timing was exquisite"
4259,"out Caught by Gowtham!! Stunner! Needed something like this to break this partnership and the two Karnataka lads combine to send batsman back. Another wrong 'un from Gopal and batsman once more spotted it early, sat down on his knee to play the slog and sweep, struck it powerfully and flat towards deep mid-wicket, the ball was dying in front of Gowtham, who covered good ground, dived full length and took it inches from the ground. batsman c Gowtham b bowler 46(29) [4s-9]"
4260,"FOUR, easy pickings! Back of a length on middle and leg, batsman waits and gently tickles it fine, the man is inside the ring at 45 and it was well wide of him, raced across the lightning outfield"
4261,"FOUR, consecutive boundaries and this was not a poor delivery. Fab shot from Watto. Spotted third man inside the ring, waited for the back of a length delivery on off and dabbed it past a diving backward point, the quick outfield takes care of the rest"
4262,"FOUR, third boundary of the over. bowler is going for plenty. Short delivery and at 132 clicks it is not going to trouble batsman, who pulls it along the ground in front of square, the placement was perfect"
4263,"FOUR, 19 runs off the over. Raina's wicket has done nothing to slow down the scoring rate. Off-cutter on a length, batsman just guides it past backward point and short third man"
4264,"out Caught by Gowtham!! Juggled and taken. Gowtham must be a relieved man. For a second it seemed like he parried it over. batsman shimmies down and gets close to the wrong 'un, smokes it flat and hard towards long-on, Gowtham times his jump and goes reverse cup, but the ball bursts out and luckily for him goes straight up, he gathers himself and completes the catch. batsman c Gowtham b bowler 5(3) [4s-1]"
4265,"FOUR, edged and four! Not where he intended, but when luck is on your side, everything goes your way. bowler comes round the wicket and cramps batsman for room, he attempts a cut shot and the outside edge runs away to the right of Buttler"
4266,"out Caught by Stokes!! Third for Gopal. He's been exceptional today. Standout bowler by far for Royals. It was the sort of half-tracker that got Kohli and de Villiers couple of matches ago, batsman went deep in the crease to play the pull and hit it straight to deep mid-wicket. The big England all-rounder ain't dropping that. team fighting back with a couple of wickets. batsman c Stokes b bowler 3(7)"
4267,"FOUR, batsman needs to keep going for team. The runs have dried up a bit in the last few overs. Trifle short and outside off and batsman waits before playing the cut shot past the diving backward point fielder"
4268,"FOUR, delicate! Slower back of a length delivery, Bravo walked across his stumps to get inside the line and then glances it off the hips past the short fine fielder, just a roll of the wrists to pocket a boundary"
4269,"1 run, hundred for batsman. Two in two days in this IPL. Gayle yesterday and batsman today. The helmet comes off and the bat is up in the air to acknowledge the applause of the traveling fans. There was also a little fist pump as soon as he placed it in the gap. He scored a hundred for Royals while playing against team and now he's done the vice versa - the first player to do that. Coming to the ball: Back of a length around off, batsman knocks it wide of point and reaches the milestone"
4270,"FOUR, offers room on this slower delivery and Bravo is quick to capitalize, he waits before unleashing the cut shot over backward point, no one in the deep to stop that. Much needed boundary for Bravo"
4271,"1 run, dropped! Samson the man who puts it down. Bravo tried to repeat the previous shot, but does not get the elevation on the cut shot, Samson jumps up at backward point and parries it over him. Should have done a better job there. team have not had a good day in the field"
4272,"FOUR, one-handed pull from Bravo. He was deceived by the slower delivery and the bottom hand comes off the bat handle, but the placement is behind square and a desperate dive from Klaasen is not enough to stop the boundary"
4273,"FOUR, ends the over well. Made room while dancing down, the width on offer made him free his arms and send the ball sailing over the extra cover fielder. Rocketed away to the fence"
4274,"out Caught by Buttler!! Edged and taken. Some of the team players run up to Watto and congratulate him. He was one of them for eight years and walks off to a standing ovation from the yellow army. Fine innings from the Australian. Fuller and outside off, batsman with his typical bent knee looks to smoke it over long-off, only manages an outside edge to Buttler. batsman c Buttler b bowler 106(57) [4s-9 6s-6]"
4275,"1 run, dropped! Short and wide outside off, batsman cuts it firmly to point but a diving effort by Tripathi saves a certain boundary. In fact it was a chance, Tripathi got his hand to it but couldn't take it"
4276,"SIX, Watto is off to a flier. Although he has been dropped twice, he's continuing to take on the bowlers. This was a length delivery around off, batsman stood tall and clobbered it over the extra cover fence for half a dozen more"
4277,"SIX, last ball of the over fetches six more. bowler wouldn't like this. He's the most expensive buy of this IPL among Indian players. Short of a length around off, batsman camps back and hammers it over mid-wicket for a flat six"
4278,"FOUR, boundaries continue to flow. Short and slow on middle and leg, batsman swivels and pulls it past the fielder at short fine leg, does well to get it past him"
4279,"FOUR, all bowlers are proving to be expensive. team openers are making the most of the powerplay. Again this was a gift of a delivery. Fullish and on the pads as batsman flicks it nonchalantly away to the fine leg region"
4280,"1 run, 50-run stand up with that single! Short of a length on middle and leg, batsman nudges it away to short mid and scurries across to the other end"
4281,"out Caught by Buttler!! bowler strikes in his first over and sends batsman back to the hut. It was a length delivery outside off, too close to the body and batsman attempted a cut, he got an edge to it. Buttler behind the wickets makes sure to hold on to it. The batsman was in two minds there, whether to guide it to third man or play a cut shot. The dilemma resulted in his downfall. batsman c Buttler b bowler 12(8) [4s-2]"
4282,"FOUR, typical batsman there. Full length delivery around off, gets down on his knee and sweetly times his inside out shot over covers, looked pleasing to the eye that shot"
4283,"FOUR, short one on the thigh and batsman drags it down to the fine leg fence. bowler has struggled with his lines so far. Bowled a few looseners in his first over too"
4284,"FOUR, commits the same mistake again. Fires in a low full toss on the pads and batsman makes sure to get some bat on that. Tickles it away to the fine leg fence and gets four more, that's the third boundary of the over"
4285,"FOUR, brilliant! That's batsman's experience for you. This was a length delivery angled away from him and batsman played it late in order to guide it down to third man, the fielder was too square to cut it off. 16 runs of the over, all in boundaries!"
4286,"1 run, a risky single! What was batsman thinking here? Knocks the flatter delivery to the left of the bowler and takes a single. bowler had the time in the world to parry it to Rahane but he decides to go for a direct hit and misses out on a run out opportunity. batsman had given up"
4287,"SIX, gets to his fifty in style! It's a short delivery and batsman camps back and slaughters it over Stokes at long-on. Reaches the milestone and raises his bat, acknowledges the crowd"
4288,"FOUR, there's no stopping him tonight. This is short again outside off, batsman goes back in his crease and slams it through the gap at covers"
4289,"SIX, smoked it! Tossed up delivery around off, batsman slogs this over mid-wicket for half a dozen"
4290,"FOUR, that's the second 50-run partnership of the match. Short and wide outside off, batsman beautifully cuts it over point and adds four to his tally"
4291,"no run, dropped! Deja vu! Watto was dropped in the first over at first slip and he does the same now. A beautiful delivery from bowler. Seam-up delivery on a good-ish length that decks away a tad and batsman dangled his bat out. The thick outside edge carries to Watson, but that's been put down. batsman survives. The centurion wasn't quite ready - was late to react"
4292,"SIX, shot! One of best shots played today. The team skipper gives the charge by coming down the track and then offers a straight bat to thump this length ball over long-on. Off the middle and off she goes into the stands. Poses for the photographs too"
4293,"FOUR, edged and four. 14 off the opening over. Streaky, but batsman wouldn't mind much. The ball came in with the angle and batsman got an inside edge on his push, runs away to the fine leg fence"
4294,"FOUR, through the gates! That won't please the bowler, nor the captain. A fullish ball on middle and leg, batsman flicks it superbly, but was straight to the man at mid-wicket. Karn Sharma there allows it to go through his legs. First boundary in IPL for batsman"
4295,"out Bowled!! Gone! Shardul Thakur strikes. A nothing shot from the South African. No feet movement either. A cross-seamed length ball attacking the stumps, batsman stays leg-side of the ball and plays down the wrong line. The stumps get shattered. team have an early breakthrough. batsman b bowler 7(7) [4s-1]"
4296,"out Caught by Tahir!! Bravo is on his way with those celebrations, shaking it real nice. Completely deceived batsman with this slower ball. It was a short of length delivery well wide of off, batsman was looking to drag it away through the on-side. But by the time it arrived, he had completely lost his shape. The top-edge balloons towards short third man where Tahir moves a few yards back and settles under it comfortably. batsman c Tahir b bowler 22(17) [4s-1 6s-1]"
4297,"FOUR, drilled straight back, goes right through bowler and then sneaks through Rayudu as well. Clumsy sliding effort at long-on there, but considering his bruised knee, we'll cut him some slack"
4298,"out Caught by Billings!! Goes down on the back knee, wanting to unleash a big slog-sweep against this slower ball, but he's miscued it off a thick top-edge. He'll be taken at deep mid-wicket. Yes. So Bravo has his second, and there's more moves from him. batsman c Billings b bowler 5(5)"
4299,"FOUR, he's somehow glanced this yorker into the fine leg boundary. Really well done from batsman. The line - which was on leg-stump - helped his cause"
4300,"SIX, stretches out to reach this googly and then flat-bats it over long-off. Brute power"
4301,"out Caught by Billings!! batsman's head dropped as soon as this left his bat. Knew he hadn't got it off the middle. Flighted leg-break from bowler, it comes off a thick top-edge as batsman looks to slog-sweep and it's calmly taken at the mid-wicket boundary. batsman c Billings b bowler 45(37) [4s-3 6s-1]"
4302,"out Caught by Dhoni!! Slower short ball, batsman swings into a pull but all he manages is a top-edge through to Dhoni. The Royals sinking rapidly now. Hardly any celebrations from team. Dhoni just throws the ball back and waves his players to their respective positions. batsman c Dhoni b bowler 1(2)"
4303,"out Caught&Bowled!! This is a brilliant one-handed return catch from Thakur, who is absolutely fired up. He rushed batsman with the short ball, and then rushed forward in his followthrough before diving and taking it with his right hand. It was flapped up off the splice by batsman, after getting severely cramped. batsman c and b bowler 10(8) [4s-1]"
4304,"FOUR, oh shot. Nailed this pull shot through mid-wicket. Solid response after the previous ball"
4305,"FOUR, the width on this delivery spelled it out for batsman's inside-out loft. He frees his arms to cream it wide of long-off"
4306,"FOUR, quickly onto the back knee to swat this leg-break through mid-wicket. Plenty of muscle from batsman as he swishes it to the boundary"
4307,"out Bowled!! Clatters the stumps with a googly. batsman has had his fun, no more. Tries for another slog-sweep but probably didn't pick the variation. batsman b bowler 16(10) [4s-3]"
4308,"out Caught by Dhoni!! Faint tickle from batsman, and that's it. team bowled out with nine balls to go. Flat leg-break, batsman makes room to drive off the back foot but it climbs on him due to the overspin imparted. Dhoni takes care of the edge. batsman c Dhoni b bowler 0(1)"
4309,"no run. Another appeal for lbw and this time team decide to review. Fair delivery. The knuckle ball and batsman didn't pick it. Was early into the shot and got struck on the back thigh. Was there any bat involved? A light spike on the UltraEdge. An inside edge. team lose their only review. It was on a length and batsman walked forward to work it through the on-side. Didn't pick it, on that occasion did batsman"
4310,"out Caught by Karn Sharma!! Two down! batsman is distraught as he walks off. He has picked the man in the deep perfectly. Short of a length delivery on the body and batsman went aerial on the heave. Got it off the top portion of the bat and found Karn Sharma at deep backward square leg. As he walks off, mocks the pull shot (to be played along the ground). Too late! batsman c Karn Sharma b bowler 2(3)"
4311,"out Bowled!! Another knuckle ball, another wicket. Simple, right! Rajasthan are now in deep trouble. bowler changed the position of the ball in his hand at the last moment and batsman had no clue about it. Waltzed down the track and wanted to pull it away. Early to swing the bat and the ball scoots under the blade. 32/3! batsman b bowler 16(11) [4s-1 6s-1]"
4312,"FOUR, hit hard! batsman uses his feet to good effect. Dances down the ground to convert it into a half-volley and drills it down the ground. Long-on had no chance to mop that up"
4313,"SIX, 14 off the over! batsman has ensured that bowler is not settled. For the third time in as many balls, he comes down the track. It was the googly from bowler, but batsman made it into a half-volley and bludgeoned it over the bowler's head. A gigantic hit"
4314,"FOUR, poor delivery and that's been put away. First boundary for batsman! With fine leg inside the circle, he bowls a short ball down the leg-side. batsman gets a glove on the pull and the ball goes fine of the fielder at 45"
4315,"FOUR, cracking shot! batsman backed away even before the ball was delivered and that allowed him to free his arms. It was darted outside off and batsman crashed it through extra cover"
4316,"out Caught by Nair!! No batsman show today. Falls cheaply and it's the youngster from Afghanistan, who has struck in his first over. Full credit to Ashwin, perfectly set a trap and batsman has fallen into it. It was the googly from Rahman, batsman cleared his front leg and whacked across the line, forgets there is a fielder in the deep. Nair nearly made a hash of it as he misjudged it initially. Recovers in time by diving head first at deep mid-wicket and pouched it superbly. batsman c Nair b bowler 1(4)"
4317,"FOUR, loosener from Rahman and Lynn puts it away with ease. Stand and deliver stuff. Short, wide and outside off, Lynn says thank you very much and bashes it through cover"
4318,"FOUR, nicely played by DK, this was flighted well outside off, batsman went down low, rolled his wrists over and slog sweeps it past mid-wicket, beats the fielder getting across from deep mid-wicket"
4319,"FOUR, lovely, has to be the shot of the day so far. Even bowler looks perplexed, this was tossed up nicely outside off, batsman leant forward, played with the turn and drove it wide of mid-wicket, split the two men in the deep to perfection"
4320,"FOUR, cheeky and four, slower and wider of off, batsman waits on it, opens the face of the bat at the last moment and runs it past short third man, no need to run for those"
4321,"FOUR, that's powerfully struck! bowler dropped this one short and just outside off, Lynn backs away and bludgeons past the bowler, the fielder at long-off had no chance"
4322,"2 runs, 4th IPL half-century for Lynn, he gets a big applause from the crowd, the dug out seem relaxed as well. This was pushed through flatter and quicker, Lynn had to reach out as he hacked it wide of long-off, hurries back for the second run"
4323,"SIX, smashed, length delivery and Lynn is all over it like a rash. Lynn was waiting on it, plays with the angle and sends it high and deep into the stands at long-on, 103 m hit - the second longest of IPL 2018"
4324,"FOUR, cracking shot, Tye is running out of ideas, back of a length and well wide of off, Lynn gets on top of the bounce and clatters it over cover-point"
4325,"2 runs, chance and Sran has dropped it. He did all the hard work, ran across to his left from deep cover, got both hands as he slid across, but fails to hold on. A life for Lynn, how costly will it prove to be? This was short of a good length and well outside off, Lynn threw his hands at that and carved it over cover, no real timing on the shot and it should have been gobbled up"
4326,"FOUR, the boundaries are flowing for team, fraction short and sliding down the leg-side, batsman went half-way down and pulled it behind square on the on-side, the man in the deep was square and has no chance"
4327,"2 runs, slower and wider of off, Lynn went hard on the drive once again and mistimed it wide of long-off, that actually allowed the batsmen to come back for the second run"
4328,"FOUR, dropped short and wide of off, Lynn makes room and cuts it square past point. Sran has a lot of distance to cover, he slides and pulls the ball back in. The third umpire has several looks and reckons that his boot was touching the ropes as he pushed it back into play, given as a boundary"
4329,"out Caught by Rahul!! Edged and caught! A pre-meditated slog from Lynn as he shuffled right across the stumps, Tye saw it coming and fired it wide of off, Lynn was aiming for the mid-wicket fence, gets a thick and audible edge through, KL doesn't drop those and it's a much needed wicket for team. They have got rid of one dangerman, but here comes the bigger danger - it's Andre Russell. batsman c Rahul b bowler 74(41) [4s-6 6s-4]"
4330,"FOUR, easy pickings for Russell, bowler misses the yorker by an inch, turns out to be a swinging full-toss, Russell cleared his left leg, got his bat down and punched it back past the non-striker"
4331,"FOUR, back-to-back boundaries for Russell, the slower short ball from Sran, but it was short and way down the leg-side, Russell swivels across and pulls it over backward square leg, couple of bounces and over the ropes"
4332,"out Caught by Nair!! That's a big wicket for team! That might turn out to be a difference of 20-30 runs. This was another yorker from Sran, he missed his length by a bit, Russell brought his bat down like a sledge-hammer and heaved it back over the bowler's head. Only the timing wasn't as great as it normally is. Good captaincy from Ashwin to have long-off fine as well, straight down the throat of Karun and team have lost their fifth wicket. batsman c Nair b bowler 10(7) [4s-2]"
4333,"FOUR, cracking shot, short and wide of off, Gill gets on top of the bounce and cuts it square past point, beat the diving fielder and raced away to the fence in a hurry"
4334,"FOUR, that's a poor start from bowler, short and wide of off, batsman waited on that, played with an open face and beat Mujeeb's dive at short third man"
4335,"FOUR, cheeky and four, this is excellent cricket from batsman, fraction too short and wide of off, batsman waits on it, opens the face of the bat and runs it past the keeper"
4336,"FOUR, beautifully played, too much of width on offer and Gill doesn't let it go. Prods across and crashes it square past cover, the man in the deep has no chance. 17 runs from the over, a terrible one from bowler"
4337,"out Caught by Andrew Tye!! team are not finishing on a high! batsman falls after a fine cameo, this was a slower length ball from Sran, batsman was deep in the crease as he shovelled it towards the on-side, went off the inner half of the bat and straight to Tye at deep backward square leg. He takes it reverse cupped and team continue to chip away at the wickets. batsman c Andrew Tye b bowler 43(28) [4s-6]"
4338,"out Caught by Rajpoot!! team are losing some momentum towards the end. Tye has another wicket to his name, this was a yorker length delivery outside off, Curran jammed his bat down hard, gets a thick outside edge and the ball loops to Rajpoot at short third man. Some other day, it might have gone either to his left or right, but not today. batsman c Rajpoot b bowler 1(3)"
4339,"1 run, chance and Mujeeb has dropped a dolly, short and just outside off, batsman backed away and dabbed it in the air towards short third man. Mujeeb didn't spot it early, the ball was dying in front of him, he bends down low and can't hold on. He then has a shy at the striker's end as the batsmen sneak in a single and misses, but Shubman Gill was always in"
4340,"FOUR, edged but just eludes Gayle's outstretched right-hand. bowler gains trampoline bounce outside off with this back of a length delivery, batsman pokes with hard hands and outside-edges it towards Gayle, who was at a widish slip. Gingerly stretched his right hand but it escaped away to the fence"
4341,"SIX, third short ball in a row and Lynn punishes it with ease. No venom on this occasion, Lynn gets under it and hacked it comfortably into the fine leg stands. First maximum of the innings"
4342,"FOUR, adventure from batsman. Deals another flatter ball by bringing out the reverse sweep. Picked the length early and broomed it away to the third man fence. Key was he rolled his wrists there"
4343,"FOUR, two fours in a row for batsman. Sliding down leg as Rahman corrects his line. batsman drags the sweep, more of the bottom. But it beats short fine leg and races away to the fence"
4344,"FOUR, this was more streaky and batsman won't mind. Hat-trick of fours. Quick and skidded through, batsman was stuck on the back foot, looked to work it to the leg-side. Ends up squirting it more off the inner half and it eludes short fine leg, who's chase is vain in the end"
4345,"FOUR, the slower version of Sran's slower ball, Lynn didn't read it as he was early into the shot. But got it off the meat as he went for the pull and sent it behind square on the leg-side. No-one there and he'll collect a boundary"
4346,"FOUR, this was out of the top draw. The slower delivery from Tye, on a short of length around middle and leg. Knuckle ball to be precise. batsman picked it early, with a roundhouse and helped it over short fine leg. Easy-peasy"
4347,"SIX, bosh! Shot. Never bowl short to batsman, Sran finds out why. Short ball aimed at the torso, batsman was ready for it. Picked the bones out of it and muscled it way back into the deep square leg stands"
4348,"FOUR, brute force from Lynn. Such quicksilver hands. Was a decent delivery as Sran saw Lynn back away to leg and fired it wider of off. But the Australian threw the kitchen sink and managed to stroke it over extra cover"
4349,"SIX, woah! Has he launched this one into the moon or what? What a shot. 97-metre hit. Length ball in the slot for Lynn, Lynn set himself and whacked it with ferocity, behind square on the leg-side and into the crowd"
4350,"SIX, 23 runs to cap off the over. Back of the hand slower ball goes awry for Sran. Lynn bent low to free his arms and launched this over deep square leg once again"
4351,"out Caught by Nair!! Straight down the gullet of Nair. The time-out has broken batsman's concentration. Was looking so good and has thrown it away. Flat and shorter from bowler, batsman rocked back and hammered it off the sweet spot. Hit it flat and didn't have enough wings to clear the ropes. Nair didn't have to move an inch at deep mid-wicket as he cupped it. Eden Gardens has been muted. The half-trackers working well for the spinners throughout this tournament so far. batsman c Nair b bowler 34(23) [4s-5 6s-1]"
4352,"out batsman Run Out!! Oh, what happened there? team have gifted a wicket away to the visitors. Hare-brained running from the duo. Complete break in communication results in a run-out. Flatter outside off, Rana went back and laced the cut to backward point. Rana set off without even looking at his partner. Lynn wasn't interested and sends him back. Both were ball-watching and Rana had no chance of returning there. Rajpoot gathers it and fires a neat throw to the keeper, who does the rest. Rana, the man in form for team has to depart. Punjab clawing back here. batsman run out (Rajpoot/Rahul) 3(5)"
4353,"FOUR, oh almost chopped on and what a good first ball that was bowler the young bowler. Pacy, good length, seam pretty straight and just tailing back in and it seriously tests batsman. He wanted to go for the drive, the feet weren't fully forward, lucky that the edge escaped past the off stick. Troubled by the movement in to him on that occasion"
4354,"FOUR, now that's brilliant placement from batsman. Third man up, so batsman uses the width on offer on this good length delivery, allows the ball to come and guides it to the left of backward point and it came from the middle of the bat as well"
4355,"FOUR, this is the thing about classy batsmen. They have this silken touch. batsman hardly had a real go at this length delivery, just came forward and went through with an extended forward push, but found the middle of the bat or close to it and got it wide of the man at cover"
4356,"FOUR, this is unfair on the bowler. He's actually surprised batsman with extra bounce on this short of length delivery, but batsman managed to play with an angled bat at the last moment, third man was inside the ring again and there was no protection in the deep"
4357,"FOUR, Dre Russ vs batsman and batsman hits a four first ball. Russell missed the yorker there, bowled a juicy full ball and batsman just placed the square-drive to the left of point, didn't try to hit that hard and this outfield is quick enough"
4358,"SIX, that's in the airrr, mistimed, the fielder jumps and it just escapes him. So that's the game for team. They top the points table. Fittingly batsman hits the winning shot. Length ball, batsman went for the loft straight, long-on ran to his right and jumped but couldn't get a hand on it"
4359,"FOUR, a boundary but this was hardly middled by batsman. The bowler actually won a mini battle there, tried the outswinger, but that didn't swing much, the angle away troubled batsman, who wanted to smash this over long-off, the ball hits the outside half of the bat and flies over cover-point"
4360,"FOUR, that's sloppy from Narine, should have been stopped. Again batsman fails to time the ball, this was a good length delivery that rushed, the ball took the inside edge of the bat and escaped wide of mid-wicket"
4361,"SIX, that's inexperience for you from the bowler. He was troubling batsman with the inswingers, this is the final ball of his second over, he may not be given the third, so now he tries something different from what was working and gets smashed. Short and rising, batsman nonchalantly pulls over square leg. How good a shot was that?"
4362,"SIX, nope! Please don't bowl there Russ! You know it's all too easy if you bowl full against a power-hitter. batsman easily gets under this ball and launches it wide of long-on"
4363,"FOUR, look at the frustration on Russell's face. He thought of outsmarting batsman by taking pace off the ball, but batsman cleverly delayed the shot. He moved leg-side early, but held the pose for a bit and then cut it between point and cover-point. Expertly done"
4364,"SIX, the upper cut and it's gone all the way. This guy averages around 50 in T20s at this venue I guess! Oh Dre Russ is down on the floor after delivering that ball. Looks like he's done a hammie here. Anyway, this was a short ball that came at pace and batsman's leg-side movement gave him the space to free the arms and slice the ball over third man. The connection was spot on"
4365,"FOUR, that's the over spoiled, tried the offie again but sprayed it down the leg-side, fine leg was inside the ring and batsman happily helps it on its way over short fine leg. Gee he's looking ominous"
4366,"FOUR, hey Sunil! Gotta move buddy! batsman went back and pulled this short ball fine, Narine was at short fine leg, he hardly moved, should have tried at least, instead he put his arm out to the man in the deep, who clearly had no chance"
4367,"FOUR, this guy is striking them at 264 and bits but doesn't play rash shots. That's the feature of his batting. Spots the field, fine leg is inside, so he allows the ball to come, the line was down the leg-side and he just helped it away fine past the keeper"
4368,"FOUR, absolutely no mercy from batsman. Well, a rank long hop doesn't deserve respect anyway. batsman quickly rocks back and pulls powerfully, splits long-on and deep mid-wicket quite easily"
4369,"SIX, got to feel for the bowlers who are forced to bowl a defensive line with these big bats and small boundaries. Can cricket be kind on them please? bowler did the right thing by spinning the ball away from batsman and bowling wide outside off stump, but he bowled too full and the big man got under it to smash it over long-on"
4370,"SIX, that ball stayed up for an eternity. The fielder at long-on thought he was in with a chance, but it is Chris batsman who is batting and even a miscue from him will clear the rope. Went after the wrong 'un and cue-ended the loft, just about managed to clear the field"
4371,"SIX, full toss and smashed. A hat-trick of fifties for batsman and this is a bloke who went unsold originally and was picked last minute at base price. He hits this straight and does the ""baby celebration"" of his. Gets a great round of applause from the crowd"
4372,"SIX, crunched! A 24-ball fifty for KL batsman. How well has he played thus far in the tournament! Shortish delivery from bowler, batsman pulls off the back foot, hit flat and hit over the mid-wicket boundary"
4373,"FOUR, batsman wants to finish this off early. Bravely races down the pitch and forces bowler to shorten the length, it was well outside off stump, but batsman reached out and cut it away past cover"
4374,"FOUR, cut away fiercely past point and a big roar from the crowd! Who are they supporting? Quicker delivery outside off stump, batsman goes back and cuts really hard"
4375,"out Caught by Tom Curran!! He's mistimed this high in the air and deep mid-wicket takes it. Short ball, batsman went for the pull, came off the bottom of the bat as the ball came slowly onto him. Walks off to a great applause, raises the bat to the crowd. He really wanted to end this game in a hurry. What a top knock though. It was so good to watch him score quick runs with proper cricketing shots. batsman c Tom Curran b bowler 60(27) [4s-9 6s-2]"
4376,"FOUR, that four evens out the over. Once more bowler goes for the fuller length and with mid-off inside the ring he was taking a risk, batsman hammers the drive straight of mid-off and collects the boundary"
4377,"1 run, short of length around off, batsman back cuts it to third man. The 50-run stand comes up and the rebuilding work is done, now they need to kick-on and to get a par total"
4378,"FOUR, top shot! Full delivery at 146kph, but Iyer had made some room to open up the off-side field, lofts it without much footwork over extra cover and pocketed a much needed boundary"
4379,"SIX, good over for DD, 12 runs off it. They need plenty more of it. Slower delivery and batsman picked the bones out of that one, delayed his loft and smashed it straight back over, pinged the ad boardings on the full"
4380,"SIX, massive! For a second it seemed to be traveling out of Chinnaswamy. Sundar changes his line of attack - comes round the wicket and slants it right in the slot, Iyer clears his front leg and heaves it deep into the mid-wicket stand"
4381,"SIX, fifty for Iyer. Gets there in style. First for him in this IPL. Needs to keep going though. Fetched it from well outside off, might have been a wide had he let go, but he doesn't and swipes it across the line flat over cow corner"
4382,"out Caught by Siraj!! Soft soft dismissal. And the sea of red is alive again. The momentum is broken and Iyer has himself to blame. That would have been a wide had he let go, instead reaches out for the full delivery and slices it to short third man. There was no need for him to play that. Could have picked up a wide and then made use of the extra delivery. Instead he loses his wicket. team needed that wicket as the partnership had started to flourish and was looking dangerous. batsman c Siraj b bowler 52(31) [4s-4 6s-3]"
4383,"no run, bowler appeals for LBW. But that ball had clearly pitched outside leg. batsman winds up for a big mow by clearing his front leg, was beaten for pace as he missed the heave to the leg-side, pinged on the back thigh where there is no protection. He is down on the ground grimacing in pain. Meanwhile, team take the review and waste it. Not sure who prompted them to challenge the decision as it had pitched miles outside leg. Nonetheless, the good thing for DD is batsman is back on his feet and is ready to resume.."
4384,"out Caught by Siraj!! bowler has his bunny. He has made it a habit of removing the Aussie. Had the better of him during the ODI and T20 leg in 2017. Now also was held back by Kohli specifically for this. Flighted leg-break on off and middle, batsman tries the fancy reverse sweep and is undone by the extra bounce, the top-edge balloons towards short third man, Siraj runs to his right, dives full length and manages to cling on. batsman c Siraj b bowler 4(6)"
4385,"SIX, fabulous shot! It was the wrong 'un and batsman seemed to have picked it from the hand, didn't try to go across the line, went straight and the boy packs a punch, cleared long-off with ease"
4386,"SIX, back to back sixes and this was superb. The reverse sweep that goes all the way. bowler pushed it through after being hit over his head, batsman spotted that and used his pace to broom him away over the third man fence"
4387,"FOUR, edged and four. Third man is square and Tewatia got it fine enough to beat him. Just a good length delivery angled across the left-hander, Tewatia went hard on the drive and the outside edge went away quickly to the fence"
4388,"FOUR, just over. A mistimed shot that clears the backtracking mid-off fielder. Slanted across off, Tewatia made a bit of room and sliced the drive over Siraj, who put in a desperate dive and still couldn't get there"
4389,"FOUR, fifty for batsman. Mighty fine innings from the youngster. But with three overs to go he needs to keep going. Short of length delivery and batsman was early into his swivel-pull, off the toe-end and past the man at 45"
4390,"SIX, flat six! That was just a flick of the wrists and Woakes had no chance. bowler missed the yorker and the low full toss was right in the arc for batsman, who crouched a bit and whipped it over deep square leg"
4391,"SIX, wow! What power. It was the slower delivery and batsman had to manufacture all the power, he waited and waited before standing tall and smoking it over long-off, cleared the rope comfortably as well"
4392,"SIX, raining sixes at the moment. Good length ball outside off, batsman had the space to work with and he accepted the width gleefully, smashed the inside out loft over extra cover for a maximum"
4393,"leg byes, FOUR, does not matter how they come as long as the runs keep coming for DD. The back of a length delivery on middle and leg, batsman swivels to play the pull, misses and the ball lobs off thigh pad over de Kock"
4394,"FOUR, geez! AB would be proud of that shot. The reverse scoop. Yes, he has played a reverse scoop off a fast bowler. bowler went full and wide outside off, batsman kept his balance and spooned it over short third man. Even Kohli seemed impressed with that shot"
4395,"FOUR, another costly death over for team, 18 off it. The off-pace short of length delivery, batsman spotted it early, shuffled across to get inside the line and pulled it over short fine, once it cleared the fielder there was no stopping that"
4396,"SIX, smoked! batsman is smashing them to all parts. Small shimmy to convert it into a length delivery, once he did that the rest was easy, went through with the shot and pummeled it over long-on for half a dozen"
4397,"out Caught by de Villiers!! AB clings on to the skier and a fine knock comes to an end. He has put his team in the ascendancy here. The cross seamer from Anderson, seemed to have held up on the surface, batsman went for the loft back over the bowler, skewed it off the base of the bat to long-on. AB ain't dropping those. Tewatia also pats his partner on the back as he walks off. batsman c de Villiers b bowler 85(48) [4s-6 6s-7]"
4398,"FOUR, premeditation from Tewatia. Walked across his stumps even before Anderson bowled the ball, it was outside off and he still managed to lap it over short fine. Umesh gives chase and can only escort it to the fence"
4399,"out Caught by Chahal!! This was bound to happen. batsman was struggling to get going and finally throws it away. Probably the pressure of the dot balls created by the pacers. This was short in length and hurried on to the batsman, and although batsman picked the length early he couldn't middle the pull. Gets it off the splice towards short mid-wicket where Chahal completes an easy catch. batsman c Chahal b bowler 3(10)"
4400,"FOUR, first one of the night! Short one on middle and leg, Iyer drags it away to deep square leg to score the first boundary of the match"
4401,"FOUR, back of a length well outside off, Iyer reaches for it and slams it through the gap at covers, that's his second boundary, and Delhi's second boundary too"
4402,"out Bowled!! Knocked him over. Gambhir departed early and it's batsman who departs now. That was a flat and quick delivery on leg, batsman goes back in his crease to drag it away but gets undone due to the lack of bounce. The ball skids on and takes down his leg-stump. Fine display of bowling by team this has been so far. Both DD openers are back in the pavilion now. Onus on the middle order batsmen to get them out of trouble. batsman b bowler 5(16)"
4403,"FOUR, slammed away! Rishabh batsman announces his arrival at the crease in style. Picks the length early, camps back and punches it firmly through the gap at cover to get off the mark with a boundary"
4404,"FOUR, reverse swept! Flighted one around off, batsman goes down on his knee and reverse sweeps it past the man at backward point to score a boundary, did well to connect his shot and past the fielder"
4405,"FOUR, width on offer and that's been put away. Short and wide outside off, Iyer goes back in the crease and cuts it nicely through point. Sweeper cover sprints across in order to save it but fails in his quest"
4406,"SIX, that six will spoil Umesh Yadav's figures. He had conceded only 13 runs off his 3 overs, ends with figures of 4-0-27-1. Was a full length ball on leg as Iyer nonchalantly flicked it over the mid-wicket fence, was timed to perfection by the youngster"
4407,"FOUR, that's sweet from batsman. Exquisite timing. Good length ball curling away from off, batsman caresses it on the up through the covers. Just had to find the gap there, races away on this outfield"
4408,"FOUR, 137kph on the pads. And it doesn't even pitch. Oh my. batsman's swipes, heaving it into square leg, flat"
4409,"out Caught by Boult!! Just the worst of full tosses. No forget that. It's never going to be remembered. Boult has clinched that 10 lakh cheque for the end of the season. It's a catch for the ages. A viral catch. So batsman quite obviously whips the innocuous, without bothering to keep it down. Over square leg. Boult comes out of nowhere, sticks his right hand up. And it sticks. With him eventually falling in a millimeter in front of the FBB prismic sponsor on the rope. Nobody can seem to believe. Yeah, muggles, it's true. batsman c Boult b bowler 30(26) [4s-2 6s-1]"
4410,"SIX, continues his fun tirade. Keeps getting nothings on the pads, sitting up to be smacked. Obliged. Fiercely swatting into deep mid-wicket"
4411,"FOUR, gets well across, wanting to go over mid-wicket. And typically changes his mind, like only he can. Ruins a wide yorker, slicing it through extra cover all of a sudden. Just sublime. And yes, a fifty .. he's killing the contest"
4412,"SIX, there's his arc. You genius. Reads the fuller sucker that's to follow, sits, shuffles and it's behind square. In less than a second. Oh the nerve!"
4413,"SIX, spectator down - into her jaw. Now who's missing Gayle when AB can break jaws as well. Back on a knee, under the swinging tonk, and into the second tier at cow corner"
4414,"SIX, the second tier tonks have become boring. So AB goes into the third. Once that front leg goes out of the way, it's always into the orbit. And then the ball's on the meaty length too. Whacked, straight down"
4415,"FOUR, the carnage. Morris loses it down leg, the last hit has mentally scarred him. And is mowed away, fine"
4416,"SIX, nobody's getting it right. bowler returns with a full toss, nice and high, and Anderson's reversing roles. Smokes it into cow corner"
4417,"out Bowled!! Another twist. That ideal ball in the times of misery. Full, straight, bang in the blockhole. Anderson backs away, gives himself some room to go downtown. Misses. Big time. And the ball sneaks under to make a mess of the timber. And they take the time-out. The only strategy RCb need now is to find ways of giving AB his strike. And his century. batsman b bowler 15(13) [6s-1]"
4418,"SIX, these massive bats. So batsman's done in with the lack of pace, he swings across the line, gets the back of the bat. And it finds a way to fly high and into the fence behind the keeper"
4419,"FOUR, blame batsman for stealing AB's century. A fullish length and he throws every ounce of his muscle to cart it straight down. Roy chases, dives, and has probably cut himself on the rope. Yeah, none of it could stop the boundary though"
4420,"FOUR, beautifully played, fraction short and just outside off, AB arches back and then ramps over third man, couple of bounces and over the ropes"
4421,"FOUR, it's it. Lays into a half volley, screeching it through the covers, beating the leather off it. And team begin their move up"
4422,"out Caught by Roy!! Roy almost makes a mess of this at long leg, but he's recovered fantastically to take a superb low catch diving forward. They've referred it upstairs, but there's nothing wrong with it. Clean catch. His fingers are underneath it. The Englishman initially misjudged this top-edged sweep from batsman, stalled in his position when he should have been moving forward. But makes up with a dive. batsman c Roy b bowler 2(5)"
4423,"SIX, swept all the way over short fine. Shuffled across slightly to get inside the line of this off-break, bowler drifted it in on leg to aid the batsman further, and gets swatted into the stands with a powerful sweep shot"
4424,"FOUR, massive moment in the game. Tentative defence from batsman, the ball turns away from him to take the edge which goes between keeper and slip. Was Morris standing too wide? He barely had time to move before it went through. bowler doesn't know what to do"
4425,"out de Kock Run Out!! De Kock is gone by a mile. Dreadful running. There's a tremendous mix-up between the two batsmen and de Kock ends up around halfway down the pitch before the bails are taken off. The ball was patted towards backward point, batsman started running, stuttered to look at his partner, and then ran through. But de Kock never really took off. de Kock run out (Vijay Shankar/Pant) 18(16) [4s-1 6s-1]"
4426,"FOUR, there he goes. De Villiers is underway. Walks across the stumps, gets down low and wallops the sweep through square leg"
4427,"FOUR, now clears his front leg and lofts it inside-out over the covers. The off-side field is up and bowler has bowled to his field by drifting it in on middle, but AB is just too good"
4428,"SIX, just over the fielder. Length ball around off, batsman whips it away and he had the whole of Chinnaswamy concerned for a bit. But they shouldn't have been. Not with those wrists"
4429,"FOUR, swept away for four. De Villiers has started off brilliantly. bowler lands it on a length for him and is dispatched"
4430,"FOUR, my word, how's this gone for four! Crazy. Unbelievable power with the bottom hand. He seemed to be cramped on the back foot but is somehow able to whip it between long-on and deep mid-wicket"
4431,"FOUR, hat-trick of fours! bowler is clueless against AB at the moment. He tosses this up wide - the best thing he can think off - but AB still walks across and powers the sweep through square leg. Crowd going wild"
4432,"FOUR, now batsman joins in the fun. Not great from Morris actually. Can't feed him on the pads with a length ball, gets flicked away in a flash to the boundary"
4433,"SIX, smashes the roof of Chinnaswamy! Rank long-hop from Tewatia, just the ball which got rid of Kohli and batsman in their previous home game. But batsman is having none of that today. Rocks back and hoists it away over mid-wicket"
4434,"1 run, was it a chance? Hooda was the fielder, think the ball bounced just in front of him, nice start from bowler, full and well outside off, batsman went hard on the drive, gets a thick edge to the right of first slip, Hooda dived to his right and got a hand onto it, saved three runs for his team"
4435,"FOUR, beautifully played, will this help batsman break the shackles? Comes down the track, makes room as he did so and goes inside out over cover, one bounce and over the ropes. 13 came from the over"
4436,"FOUR, team gaining some momentum and it is the local boy - batsman who is leading the charge, flighted delivery around off, batsman reverse sweeps it backward of point and starts the over with a boundary"
4437,"SIX, lovely shot! Superb use of the feet from the southpaw, sashays down and gets close to the pitch of the delivery, then uses his bottom hand to whip it over the cow corner fence"
4438,"SIX, just the over batsman needed to get some impetus to his innings. This is a good old fashion slog sweep, Rashid errs by giving it some air and batsman kneels to get underneath it, struck powerfully enough to clear the fielder in the deep"
4439,"1 run, pushed it through and more importantly cramped batsman for room, knocked to long-on"
4440,"no run, Saha completed the catch and went up immediately. bowler joined him as well. Williamson trusting his players challenged the decision, but it remains with the onfield call. batsman steps out and is tucked by the drifter, misses the nudge into the on-side and the ball lobs off the pad to the left of Saha. He moves across to catch that"
4441,"FOUR, smashed! Flighted delivery and the idea from bowler was to land it full enough to the blockhole, batsman had made room and that allowed him to open up his arms and strike it inside out over extra cover, no chance for the sweeper to stop that"
4442,"FOUR, cracking shot! Once again the shuffle across aiding him. It is bowler's favourite length but he offers width on this occasion, batsman capitalizes and unleashes a powerful cut shot behind point, raced away to the fence"
4443,"FOUR, edged and four. That is what pace does. Short and outside off, batsman made room this time and threw this kitchen sink at it, the thickish outside edge runs away fine beating the fielder in the deep"
4444,"SIX, he is playing a gem here. The slower delivery from bowler and he picked the bones out of that, set himself on leg-stump and swung through the line, the fielder at long-on was a mere spectator"
4445,"FOUR, massive over for team, 19 runs off it. It is another edge and another boundary for batsman. He runs down the wicket and looks to force the back of a length delivery through the off-side, the outside edge runs away quickly to the third man fence"
4446,"1 run, fifty for batsman. On a surface where all the other batsmen have struggled, he has stroked a flawless half century. The whole team in the dugout stand up to applaud. Tossed up on off, batsman wrists it to long-on and reaches the milestone"
4447,"SIX, hammered! He is toying with the bowling. bowler is clearly rattled, bowls a juicy full toss as batsman dances down the wicket, easy pickings for the batsman as he slots it into the crowd at long-on"
4448,"FOUR, now he is playing with the field. Walked across his stumps to the flighted delivery, sat down and broomed it backward of square leg, struck it fine enough to beat the man in the deep"
4449,"FOUR, wrong 'un is dragged down and batsman was waiting for it in the crease, cleared his front leg and pulled it in front of square, bisecting the two fielders in the deep comfortably"
4450,"SIX, Rashid is being taken to the cleaners. Tosses the googly up and batsman picked it out of his hand, he went down on his knee and slog swept it with the spin over cow corner. Got plenty of height and the required distance"
4451,"FOUR, batsman does not want to be left out. He hangs back to this wrong 'un and since the ball is turning it away, it offers him the room to slap it past the diving extra cover fielder. Long-off can only pick the ball up from the fence"
4452,"FOUR, wow! We saw Rishabh Pant play the reverse paddle yesterday, today it is batsman. This is more deft than Pant's powerful strike. Knuckle ball and batsman just bent down, reverse lapped it fine to the third man fence"
4453,"out batsman Run Out!! 1 run completed. What just happened there? ""One of the very best from batsman,"" says Sanjay Manjrekar on air and I couldn't agree more. He lifts the back of a length delivery on the bounce to long-off, settles with a single as Pandey lobs the ball back to Kaul, who fumbles and batsman thought there was a chance to steal a second. Raina stands his ground and by the time batsman turns back, Kaul gets to the ball and throws it to KW to remove the bails. There was never a second and batsman knew that, he walks up to Raina with a smile on his face, hugs him and trudges off to a standing ovation. batsman run out (bowler/Williamson) 79(37) [4s-9 6s-4]"
4454,"FOUR, almost cleaned up Raina at the other end. The leg-break is right in the slot for him, small step forward and murders the ball straight back, Raina was ducking for cover and the fielder at long-on didn't even try to chase that"
4455,"FOUR, poor bowling from Rashid. Very rarely does that happen. But he has had two off days back to back. Went for 55 against team and today ends with 1/49. Short and down leg, all batsman had to do was help it past the fielder at short fine, he does so with utter ease"
4456,"FOUR, top-edge and four. Not where he intended but batsman starts the over with a boundary. He was rushed by a short delivery and the pull is late, the edge goes away fine and he asks the umpire whether it is one for the over, the square leg umpire nods in approval"
4457,"FOUR, fifty for batsman. A very unlike batsman innings. He bided his time before he got going. Now is well set to take team past the 180-mark. The knuckle ball with width on offer, batsman just laces the cut square on the off-side. The sweeper is straighter than usual and he doesn't get there in time"
4458,"FOUR, Kaul has his hands on his hip. Not much he can do there. Just the class of batsman. A low full toss outside off, batsman opens the bat face and carves it past the diving short third man fielder"
4459,"SIX, easy peasy! Just a short-arm jab and the ball clears the rope. bowler rolls his fingers across the ball and bowls it on a length, batsman smokes it over deep mid-wicket nonchalantly"
4460,"SIX, cracking shot, rare bad ball from bowler, back of a length and on the stumps, batsman swivels across and pulls it high and over square leg, went a long way over the ropes for a maximum"
4461,"out Caught by Deepak Hooda!! bowler has his man now! That's a big wicket for the Sunrisers, this was the knuckle ball and batsman didn't pick it, he was done in by the change of pace as well, went through with the flick far too early, the ball lobbed off the splice of the bat and it's a simple low catch for Hooda - at short mid-wicket. The crowd finds its voice, no heroics from batsman today. batsman c Deepak Hooda b bowler 9(15) [6s-1]"
4462,"FOUR, risky but four, batsman backed away a long way, bowler followed him with a full ball, but batsman has enough room to free his arms and drives it square behind point, beats third man getting across for his first boundary"
4463,"FOUR, on a length and well outside off, batsman comes down the track, doesn't get anywhere close to the pitch - but has enough to clear cover with the lofted drive, the timing wasn't great, but the ball has enough to beat the chasing pack"
4464,"out Stumped!! .. and Rashid strikes with his first ball. A different day and some different results already. batsman was struggling to get a move, doesn't spot the leg-break, lunged forward on the sweep and missed, to make things worse - he slipped as he tried to get back into the crease. Saha whipped the bails off with batsman well outside the crease, Anil Chaudhary doesn't need the help of the third umpire, off he goes, a poor start for batsman in IPL 2018. batsman st Saha b bowler 11(13) [4s-1]"
4465,"FOUR, that's brave from batsman, but he knew what he was doing, fetches this well tossed up delivery from well and slogs it over mid-wicket, there's no one in the deep and batsman gets going with a boundary"
4466,"1 run, a direct hit and batsman might have been in trouble, he drove one to the right of point and had a stuttered start. Raina was always coming and that forces batsman to accelerate. Bhuvi was quick on the ball and has a shy at the bowler's end. He misses with batsman well short of making his ground. batsman seemed upset with his partner at the calling, turned around towards Raina after completing the single"
4467,"SIX, massive, length delivery outside off, batsman bends down on one-knee, picks up the length and swipes it high and way over wide long-on for a humongous hit"
4468,"out Caught by Watson!! Edged and taken! Watson put one down in the previous contest but makes sure to take one today. It's a full length delivery outside off, batsman pokes at it and gets a thick outside edge to Watson at first slip. The youngster walks back to the hut without troubling the scorers. Excellent start for team and bowler. batsman c Watson b bowler 0(5)"
4469,"FOUR, first boundary of the innings! batsman makes the most of the provided width. It's a short of a length delivery outside off, batsman reaches for it and slams it through the gap at cover-point to gather his first boundary of the innings"
4470,"out Caught by Raina!! Gets him with the googly. 100th T20 wicket for bowler. It was flighted up on leg-stump, once batsman saw that line he knelt down to sweep. But there was a bit of extra bounce with this delivery which produced the top-edge. Raina accepts the dolly at short fine leg. batsman c Raina b bowler 24(19) [4s-2 6s-1]"
4471,"1 run, shimmying down to the pitch of this flighted leg-break, pushes it down to long-off. It's fifty for the team captain, but has he given up on this chase?"
4472,"SIX, doesn't look comfortable doing this, but he's somehow muscled it over wide long-off. Length ball just outside off, batsman had set himself up by clearing his front leg. Opens his body up and carves it inside out"
4473,"SIX, this time batsman goes leg-side, and collects six. He planted his back foot outside off, got a delivery which landed right in the slot, and shovelled it over wide long-on"
4474,"SIX, woah, that's massive. batsman! He sat on his back knee and whacked this slog-sweep way back into the square leg stands. Do we have a match on here?"
4475,"SIX, lays into it again, and it's six more. This is some lovely batting from the team captain. He didn't overhit the ball this time, just an extension of the off-drive, and it sails over long-off"
4476,"SIX, deep into the crease to be able to get under the ball, and get under the ball he does. Pathan has launched this over long-off. Boy have team come roaring back"
4477,"SIX, bludgeoned! He gets absolutely stuck into this slower ball and mows it over cow corner. Wow. Bravo goes for 14 in his first over"
4478,"SIX, free-hit or not, Pathan doesn't care. He smokes this full toss over long-on. He is starting to middle these now, nice and clean"
4479,"FOUR, very wide on the crease goes Bravo, but he loses his line. He strays this short of length delivery right into Pathan's chest. There's no fine leg in place, or if there is, it's not fine. Pathan helps this pull into the ropes"
4480,"out Caught by Jadeja!! Taken. Taken, taken, taken. It's a brilliant catch from Jadeja, sprinting forward from long-on and diving in front with two hands. Oh batsman. He's done in by this slower ball. Back of length from Bravo, the ball stops on batsman who miscues his flat-batted swipe off the splice. Bravo shows off with his dance moves. team will back themselves from here. batsman c Jadeja b bowler 84(51) [4s-5 6s-5]"
4481,"SIX, oh what a horrible delivery. Delicious full toss on off stump, Pathan gobbles it up as he whiplashes it over the mid-wicket boundary. Keeps team afloat"
4482,"out Caught by Raina!! Sliced up in the air, and that should be it. Raina isn't dropping that at extra cover. It's the knuckle ball in action again, Pathan swings hard at this length delivery but it comes right off the outside half. He immediately hangs his head. team running out of gas. batsman c Raina b bowler 45(27) [4s-1 6s-4]"
4483,"SIX, whacked down the ground for six. First ball Rashid faces, he leans back and pummels the slower ball. Brings the equation down to 19 needed off the final over. The way this game has gone, don't rule it out"
4484,"SIX, this is a length ball and it has disappeared. Drama. Two sixes in two balls from Rashid. He's striking it at 600. Swivels across and heaves it away over deep backward square"
4485,"FOUR, they're still in this. Quite unbelievable. Full length ball outside off, Rashid swings for the rafters and sends a thick edge flying past short third man"
4486,"FOUR, classic shot by Kane. Another short delivery well outside off, looking the class of batsman he won't miss out. Plays a perfect square cut and pierces the gap at cover-point to end the over"
4487,"out Caught by Karn Sharma!! That's the second duck of this innings. First it was Bhui and now it's Manish. Was a full length delivery outside off and swinging away from the batsman, Manish went ahead with his shot and ended up slicing it to the man at third man. Surprising to see that it carried all the way to third man. Probably there was a bit of extra bounce on that. batsman c Karn Sharma b bowler 0(2)"
4488,"1 run, that's a brilliant display of fielding by Karn Sharma in the deep. Times his jump to perfection, plucks his right arm out and grabs it before he parries it into play near the third man fence. Was short and wide outside off as batsman upper cut it towards third man and Sharma saves five runs for his team with this valiant effort"
4489,"FOUR, pulled away! Short of a length around off, batsman camps back and pulls it nicely through the gap at mid-wicket, was timed sweetly by the skipper"
4490,"FOUR, boundary to end the over. Just the over Sunrisers were looking for. Thakur drops it short again and has to pay the price for it as batsman rocks back in order to pull it over mid-wicket, yet again..."
4491,"out Caught by Jadeja!! Third wicket for bowler. He's steaming in here. Bowls a full length delivery around off with not much pace in it, Hooda is a tad early in his flick as the ball hits the back of the willow before it spoons up towards wide mid-off. Jadeja won't miss those. team in trouble. They're feeling the absence of Dhawan already. batsman c Jadeja b bowler 1(7)"
4492,"SIX, is he a playing a skipper's knock? Reminds me of the knock that Kohli played against Mumbai Indians a few days back. This is a short delivery on middle and leg, batsman is onto it in a flash as he middles his pull to perfection. Right over the square leg fence for a flat six"
4493,"FOUR, off the mark with a boundary. That's not enough though. Needs a few more of them and get going. Picks the length early on this short one and pulls it in front of deep square leg who's too square in order to cut it off"
4494,"SIX, pulled away! Was a short delivery on leg and batsman had plenty of time to heave it over the fine leg fence. The crowd is slowly getting its voice back"
4495,"FOUR, he's bowled 17 dot balls so it's okay if he concedes a boundary or two. Has been an excellent spell by bowler this. Short of a length around off, batsman jumps in his crease and cuts it away to the third man fence, beat the man in the deep quite comfortably"
4496,"FOUR, fine square cut by batsman again. Was short and wide outside off and the Sunrisers skipper did well to time his cut as he beat sweeper cover with ease"
4497,"out Bowled!! This is what swing up front will bring you. Such a blunder it was from team to bench Dhawal against team on a wicket that had a bit of grass. Lovely inswinger outside off stump, batsman is not a keen mover of the front foot, just throws his bat at it to thrash the ball through cover, only manages an inside edge that shatters the sticks. Dream start from Dhawal Kulkarni. batsman b bowler 0(1)"
4498,"SIX, he's upping the strike-rate as well. Flighted delivery down the leg-side, Ishan gets to the pitch of the ball by advancing and slogs over wide long-on"
4499,"FOUR, he's been superb with the pick-up shots today. Anything on the pads, SKY has dispatched it disdainfully. Here's another instance. Full down leg, Suryakumar gets across and whips it cleanly behind square. In the gap and zooms away to the fence"
4500,"2 runs, oh, what a clanger. Krishnappa Gowtham, what have you done? Spills a straightforward catch at long-on. This is going to hurt team, for sure. A slower ball from bowler, Suryakumar took it on and miscued it completely. Gets it off the top half of the bat towards long-on. Gowtham had to move across a bit, went with both hands but it pops out of his hands. Tried grabbing it on the second attempt, in vain"
4501,"2 runs, smashed away wide of long-on, they scamper back for the second"
4502,"FOUR, Yadav shows off his cheekiness. Manufactured room out of nowhere. Pushed through quicker outside off, Suryakumar went deep and sliced it in the gap between short third man and backward point. Threaded the gap beautifully"
4503,"FOUR, wonderful from Kishan. ""Such a dynamic player he is"" is the comment from Isa Guha on air. Greets Archer to the crease by chipping down the track, takes it on the full and lofted it with a clean swing of the arms over mid-off"
4504,"1 run, 143.3kph, low full toss on leg. Kishan with a full face of the bat wrists it to mid-wicket, where Stokes dives across and intercepts it. And that will be a half-century for Kishan. His second IPL fifty. So both batsmen who were dismissed for a first-ball duck in the previous match has made it count today. Raise of the bat from the youngster to soak in the applause from the dug-out"
4505,"FOUR, more clumsy effort from team in the field. Gopal, the guilty culprit this time, who lets it through. Kishan moved across on this occasion and helped this short of length delivery to short fine leg. Gopal was lazy to bend low and didn't get his body behind the line of the ball. Sneaked through his legs and off to the fence"
4506,"out Caught by Buttler!! Oh my word, unnecessary cheekiness from Kishan doesn't come off well. Tried to emulate Rishabh Pant's reverse scoop and fails miserably. Nonetheless, brilliant innings from him comes to an end. Second wicket for Kulkarni. Went full and wide, turned out to be a low full toss. Kishan was ready to scoop it over short fine, but messes it up and spoons it up in the air. Easy-peasy for Buttler. batsman c Buttler b bowler 58(42) [4s-4 6s-3]"
4507,"out Caught by Buttler!! team are pegging back team here. batsman has looked out of sorts since a last couple of overs and finally, he decides to throw his wicket away to bowler. Again the off-cutter, slanted around off. batsman in a bid to step up the pedal, miscues it totally. Top-edges it into the night sky, was swirling in the air. Buttler called for it, moved across to his left and safely grabbed it. batsman c Buttler b bowler 72(47) [4s-6 6s-3]"
4508,"out batsman Run Out!! Now, now. Two wickets in a span of three balls and this is a prized scalp for Rajasthan. batsman is livid with himself, punches his bat in anger. It was his call and he has to pay the price. You just cannot underestimate Rahane in the field. A meeky tap to the right of Rahane. He moved across in a flash, picked it up with one-hand and released the throw in one-motion to break the stumps. Only one stump to aim at and bingo! batsman wasn't even in the frame. Goner! batsman run out (Rahane) 0(1)"
4509,"FOUR, excellent from the senior Pandya. How late he played that? Didn't have any room there at all to free his arms. So, he stayed back, opened his bat face and glided it in the gap between short third man and backward point"
4510,"SIX, pure muscle from batsman. Finally, gets going. Cutter slanted wide of off, batsman waited and waited before butchering it over long-on. Flat-batted powerfully!"
4511,"out Caught by Klaasen!! Maiden IPL wicket for Archer. Archer will be chuffed to bits. Krunal loses shape as he winds up for a slog. Archer slips in a knuckle ball that holds up a touch on the pitch. Krunal went for the longer boundary - the deep mid-wicket area. Lacked timing and power, straight to Klaasen. Look at Archer, he breaks into a jig. batsman c Klaasen b bowler 7(6) [4s-1]"
4512,"1 run, oh, almost had two in two here. Archer drops a tough chance. Fuller ball at 145.1kph just outside off, batsman smacked it straight back at him, Archer got both hands but it slipped out"
4513,"FOUR, ouch. Take cover Rod Tucker, Hardik knocked off his head nearly. Very full on off, the slower ball at 123.1 kph, Hardik gets under it and hammered it straight down the ground ferociously. Tucker take evasive action and is on the floor"
4514,"out Bowled!! Jofra has his revenge. Sweet. Rip roaring yorker, angling on leg. Hardik is beaten for sheer pace (145.6kph). Couldn't get his bat down in time, the ball slams his pad and deflected back onto the stumps to clatter the middle stump. team losing steam towards the end. batsman b bowler 4(2) [4s-1]"
4515,"out Bowled!! Wow. Wow. 149.2 thunderbolt from Archer. Demolishes the stumps. What an over this is turning out to be. Two wickets in two balls and he's on a hat-trick now. Harpooned it full and at the stumps, batsman had no clue and failed to negate it. Straight through him to shatter the stumps. batsman b bowler 0(1)"
4516,"FOUR, bowler is not happy with the effort by Gowtham. Should've stopped definitely. batsman whacked it wide of long-on, Gowtham gets across, puts in the dive but doesn't stop it"
4517,"SIX, Suryakumar is a free-flowing player, tough to keep him calm and Kulkarni, in trying to search for swing, bowls a touch fuller and disappears. The outswinger doesn't swing, Suryakumar gets under it and lofts it easily over long-on, hit on the rise to an extent"
4518,"FOUR, 144.5kph, that's nicely picked away off the hips by batsman. Another pacy short of length delivery, actually on the stumps, but Suryakumar got inside the line and helped it away past the man at 45"
4519,"SIX, has he hit that alright? Oh yes he has! Been trying a few shots, but he's bravely raced down to a bowler who's kept him calm, the best part about it was he picked this slower ball, got into great position and absolutely smashed that over long-on. First six of the night for Ishan"
4520,"SIX, unbelievable hit! batsman is very, very good with that pick up shot of his. He's moved across a touch to this fullish delivery on the stumps and whipped away with his lovely wrists with great timing, all the way over the long-leg boundary"
4521,"FOUR, looked like it was going to either short third man or backward point for a moment, but batsman has managed to split them with this uppish cut. Poor delivery from Kulkarni, gave too much width. Mumbai have picked up pace"
4522,"FOUR, massive space for sale beyond mid-wicket and batsman, who is not afraid to walk across the stumps, meets this length ball with a flick to the right of mid-wicket and greets bowler with a boundary first up"
4523,"FOUR, this time he connects with the sweep, he actually played this with one hand. This line is a little more straighter than the previos one, Suryakumar hits the big gap at deep backward square leg"
4524,"FOUR, Archer dives but fails to stop the ball at deep mid-wicket. Short delivery on the stumps, Suryakumar pulls, deep mid-wicket runs to his left, actually got there but made a mess of it"
4525,"SIX, oh shot! Hit on one leg. bowler tried a similar ball to the previous one, Ishan connects with the pull this time despite being cramped for room and it hits the backward square leg rope on the full"
4526,"FOUR, Ishan knows he's going to bowl short, it's down the leg side and he helps himself to a boundary with a pull shot behind square on the on-side"
4527,"SIX, whata a way to bring up the fifty - off 29 balls. Flighted delivery outside off stump, Suryakumar leans forward and lofts the drive inside-out handsomely over cover. Gentle raise of the bat to the team and the crowd"
4528,"FOUR, there's a short fine leg in place but this leg-stump delivery deserves nothing less than a boundary. Tripathi crouches and glances it wide of the fielder at 45"
4529,"SIX, all the innocous-ity. 92kph, dug in half way into the pitch, turning into him down leg too. batsman waits. And waits. And swivels, rejecting the wide to pull it into fine leg"
4530,"FOUR, now the overcook. bowler tries sneaking in a quiet one, wide, full. Can't. batsman' up there smart, reaching out and drilling it through extra cover. Here's the move on .. 16 runs in it"
4531,"2 runs, drifting into middle. Whipped down the ground, and long-on's sloppy"
4532,"FOUR, sits up perfectly. batsman up there tall, already given himself loads of room and carts it over the covers. Nothing streaky here"
4533,"out Bowled!! It's in the blockhole. batsman has been walking all across, but has been getting down in time to dig things out. Until this one. It's full, it's into the base of leg, and batsman' walked across, freezing in front of the stumps as he tries using the angle to swipe it behind square. Done in for pace. Done in for dip. This is exactly where Rajasthan need to avoid doing a Mumbai. batsman b bowler 40(27) [4s-3 6s-1]"
4534,"FOUR, latches on. It's that sitting up length, and batsman goes flat-batted, riding the bounce and timing the leather off it through cow corner, splitting the two men converging. In the hope of converging"
4535,"2 runs, grips on a length, turning away slowly. batsman merely defends, and its into the vast mid-off gaps to pinch a couple. And a ninth IPL fifty"
4536,"out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! It was all timing till it lasted. The moment it deserts him, he falls. It was bowler's famed slower gripper, batsman tries hoicking it into cow corner. Gropes only the toe-end, spoons high and Hardik runs in. Nah, he ain't messing these up. batsman c Hardik Pandya b bowler 52(39) [4s-4]"
4537,"out Bowled!! Perfect peach. And Rajasthan are well and truly doing a death over Mumbai. bowler's the Jofra in the remake. Nothing slow here, full paced, 144kph, hitting the good length, seaming in sharply and staying low to go through the bat and pad on batsman's meek prod forward. batsman b bowler 6(8)"
4538,"out Caught by Ishan Kishan!! The bridge is falling. The fortess is falling in dramatic fashion. batsman gets himself a golden duck on his home debut. Fizz comes up with his go-to ball - a cutter slanting across. batsman with flat feet looks to drive away from his body, gets the customary edge and Ishan's diving low to his right to collect. Yes his black eye doesn't stop him from judging these perfectly. batsman c Ishan Kishan b bowler 0(1)"
4539,"SIX, rocks back, deep in the crease, getting that front leg out once again. And targets the smallest part of the ground - cow corner. And swings. Smoking"
4540,"FOUR, edge. And the Royals have a massive edge of life. 15 off this one and all of a sudden there's oxygen still there in this one. A low full toss, across batsman, who throws his bat out in an attempt to slice. He'll make his peace with the edge, running past the keeper"
4541,"FOUR, very, very Caribbean. Okay former Caribbean. Archer transfer back, lets the ball get on par and waits on his drive, opening it to pierce the gap behind point. And that gap is huge"
4542,"FOUR, utter disdain. Take that .. width, pace and it is back in that point zone. Thumped hard. How things turn"
4543,"FOUR, goes pulling. And goes into the gap. Doesn't get enough meat, and thank heavens for that. It goes a lot finer, beating square leg in the ring. It's 10 off the final over. And you thought this was over, twice"
4544,"out Caught&Bowled!! Another twist. Agatha Christie would be so damn proud. Pandya lets out the bouncer, neatly directed into the head, and Archer's pulls in desperation, top-edging it high. Pandya takes matters into his own hands. Calls and holds his nerve. batsman c and b bowler 8(9) [4s-1]"
4545,"FOUR, top thinking. He's spotted third man inside the ring, and ramps his bat out to shove it over. Wrong line, wrong length"
4546,"SIX, it's in the orbit. It's into the car park. And batsman turns hero - coming right at the climax, scoring at a strike rate of 300. Gets a juicy back of a length ball, in the slot and flat-bats it across the line. Into the clouds. And then cow corner"
4547,"out Caught by Suryakumar Yadav!! Even bowler cannot believe it. Gets that rainbow-from-this-palm-to-other pose dead right. A bit of loop after that first ball, and Tripathi middles this straight to mid-on. Straight to him. Would have wanted to go over the fielder but times it right into his hands. Well, this debut at the top doesn't go so well.. batsman c Suryakumar Yadav b bowler 9(8) [4s-1]"
4548,"FOUR, now what do I call that.. Will be an outside edge to the naive but this has been cleverly played late and just wide of the keeper. Bat face opens at the last minute and bowler's grounded. Sort of. We'll see"
4549,"FOUR, full and wide, and the long-limbed batsman is not going to miss out. Reaches out, with footwork into a snooze, but who cares. It's all hands. Creams the drive through covers. Bullets it. Surgeons it. Whatever. It's batsman, okay? We're allowed to drool this season"
4550,"FOUR, proper batsman. Early to load onto the front foot and then drills it away through covers. Nothing bowler could have done, except maybe pitching it a bit shorter. But then batsman might have come up with something else"
4551,"out Caught by Krunal Pandya!! bowler had pared down Rajasthan with pace, or the lack of it. Three slower deliveries in a row and that was it for batsman. Takes it on with a flat-batted swat and all he manages is a toe-end to mid-wicket. Krunal's tall and leaps a little to take this screamer. It's a pun alright, because you should have seen Krunal screaming. batsman c Krunal Pandya b bowler 14(17) [4s-1]"
4552,"FOUR, that's why you can't not like him. bowler strategy is pretty obvious: Bowl it slow and angle it across, because there's third man and backward point waiting to cut the runs off. And batsman here has found the tiniest of gaps between the fielders. Beautifully done, opening the bat face just enough to cleave the fielders"
4553,"FOUR, this spins more, so this is the googly from back fo the hand. batsman gets into a shape to sweep nicely and brooms it away through mid-wicket"
4554,"no run, bowler is excited but that looks high. Traps batsman on the shuffle with this delivery. Oh they've gone for the review. It's hit the knee-roll bang in front of off-stump, so the impact is alright. But as we doubted, the bounce in this Jaipur deck is taking the ball over the stumps -- the ball-tracking confirms. So not out it'll be and Mumbai lose their review"
4555,"FOUR, pumped over mid-off for first IPL runs. It wasn't as close as you want to hear it was. Chipped the loft over Ashwin, who's tall enough. Good use of the length ball and the slight width that batsman used to use his arms into effect"
4556,"no run, Ashwin reviews. Makes sure first with the keeper that it was straight enough and then goes for it. Last ball from bowler was the one that shaped away and beat batsman, and this straightened and slithered on to rap batsman's front pad's flap. But tell you what, this is just a bit naff, this review. Pitches almost a foot outside leg-stump, and it's not out -- just as the on-field umpire thought"
4557,"FOUR, throws his hands at this wide ball that's been angled across by bowler from over the wicket. And gets away. Backspins and beats the keeper to his left"
4558,"FOUR, wow, get the thesaurus out. That's been cracked away with utter disdain. Short and wide yeah, but look at the sound the bat makes. Pinches the slightest gap at point and lasers it away"
4559,"FOUR, that's a bit ambitious.. and he's gotten some lucky runs here. Stays back and wants a stylish and uppish back foot punch through covers. Not in control of the bounce and the outside edge flies over the lone slipper in place"
4560,"FOUR, off-spin was working alright against batsman in the previous over for bowler and he gets whacked trying to bowl leg-spin. Short and wide, Shreyas absolutely nails it off the back foot wide of cover"
4561,"out Christian Run Out!! 1 run completed. bowler was confident after whipping the bails off and he was spot on. Shortish from bowler, Shreyas flicks it wide of long-on, Mayank rushed to the ball and fired in a perfect through on the bounce and adjacent to the sticks. bowler shatters the stumps. The second run was on and Christian should have been a touch more quicker. TV umpire has a look and catches Christian a few inches short. Christian run out (Mayank Agarwal/bowler) 6(11)"
4562,"no run, the appeal was so loud and confident that the umpire was under a lot of pressure, fair on team's part because they thought it was a genuine edge, but the fact that batsman immediately smiled and reviewed clearly suggested he didn't hit this. Maybe the ump should have originally given the benefit of doubt to the batsman, because the bat also hit the ground. Wide yorker, batsman tried to squeeze, missed it completely and there's no spike on UltraEdge. Review saves batsman"
4563,"FOUR, overpitched and Shreyas drills it straight down the ground between the sticks and the non-striker, long-on and long-off had no chance"
4564,"SIX, that's a brilliant hit under pressure. bowler, why did you run in and bowl a full ball in the slot? He followed batsman who was backing away, but landed perfectly for Tewatia to tee off over long-off"
4565,"FOUR, what a timely hit! He's moved across the stumps, got down on his knees and paddled the fast bowler around the corner through backward square leg. Brave hit! bowler missed the yorker again and offered a full ball on the stumps"
4566,"out Caught by Rahul!! Got to be a slower into the pitch and it's done the trick. Maybe bowler won't mind about bowling the extra ball now with the wide call earlier. This was cleverly angled across the left-hander on a good length, Tewatia goes for a big slog and gets an edge that goes slowly to Rahul. batsman c Rahul b bowler 24(21) [4s-1 6s-1]"
4567,"out Caught by Nair!! And what does he do first ball? Advances and connects well, but finds the fielder at deep backward square leg. It was a short slower ball, batsman wanted to flick that in the gap wide of deep mid-wicket, but hit it too square and too well. batsman c Nair b bowler 0(1)"
4568,"SIX, smashed, short and outside off stump, Shreyas flat-bats the loft over long-off. Fifty up for batsman, good knock but he needs to connect them well from here on"
4569,"FOUR, inside edgeeee and it's past the dive at short fine leg. Lucky boundary and it's down to 5 runs off the last ball. Shreyas races down the pitch and slogs, gets a thick edge"
4570,"out Bowled!! That's not a bad debut at all. Dropped a catch in the first innings but walked in to bat in all his elements. Was a bit overamibtious here, you could say, and bowler has beaten him with a 134ks delivery. Shaw tried a hack across the line, missed the seam-up delivery and lost the top of his off-stump. batsman b bowler 22(10) [4s-4]"
4571,"FOUR, timing isn't something batsman has made a name out of, but if these continue, we'll need a rethink. Archaism, I tell you. Gets a delivery on the pads and times the hell out of it through mid-wicket"
4572,"out Caught by Finch!! In the air, hasn't hit this well and Finch runs around to his left from long-off to take the catch. What a squeeze this is from team. batsman is distraught and he looks towards the sky. The flatter delivery outside off stump, Shreyas slices the loft high in the air as the ball spun away from him. He wanted to go over long-off. batsman c Finch b bowler 57(45) [4s-5 6s-1]"
4573,"SIX, that's flown away like it belongs to the stands. Full pace at 136ks and steaming into the pads, and batsman's just flunked it over backward square leg with a bat swing. Sounds easy, right?"
4574,"out Caught by Andrew Tye!! They're checking bowler's front foot but he's fine. A bit of a sudden rush of blood from batsman, but he bats like that, doesn't he? Didn't read the cutter that was pitched on a back of a length, went for the mightly hack across the line and sliced it off the toe-end to deep mid-wicket. There were two other fielders running back from inside the ring but that was Tye's catch all the way. batsman c Andrew Tye b bowler 12(10) [4s-1 6s-1]"
4575,"out Caught by Finch!! They all want to go home. batsman is a bit early into tucking this seam-up delivery on a back of a length, and pops a leading edge to mid-off. Sticky Kotla? Certainly for Delhi, now. batsman c Finch b bowler 4(13)"
4576,"FOUR, short ball sitting up, and batsman pulls it with authority through deep mid-wicket"
4577,"FOUR, beautifully sliced wide of backward point's leap and that's been let through by Mujeeb, who's running across from third man. Covers the ground, slides but can't stop the ball. Was almost in control but then wasn't"
4578,"out Bowled!! Through 'im! Carrom ball from round the wicket this, and it spins in to cleave batsman into two. He's trying to clip it through mid-wicket, doesn't have his head around this variation (or bowler's stock ball?) and succumbs. batsman b bowler 4(7)"
4579,"out Caught by Shreyas Iyer!! Huge wicket! Just like Rahul, batsman is also beaten for pace in his first ball against Avesh and the young lad has knocked the Aussie off. Superb stuff and he is pumped up. Back of a length outside off, clocked 148.7kph and it did seem really fast off the surface as well. batsman too didn't help his cause as he just tried to use his hands to lift this away down the ground. Wasn't there for that shot, not with this kind of pace and he was late as well. Popped an easy catch towards extra cover. batsman c Shreyas Iyer b bowler 2(4)"
4580,"FOUR, inside-out. That's some welcome. A wobbly seam off a length, looking to follow batsman as he backs away. But he goes uppish, lofting up a drive over extra cover"
4581,"FOUR, 141kph. And an inside edge allows batsman the move on. He tries going against the line, pulling, without judging the length not being short enough .. inside half, and Pant diving behind deflects it into fine leg"
4582,"out Caught by Pant!! The inside-edge luck runs out. And eventually the inside-edge takes him to his doom. Blame it on his feet refusing to move, yet again. Avesh keeps it on a back of a length, batsman loads up again to flat-bat across the line. Inside-tickle, and no matter how loud Kotla is, the nick is louder. batsman c Pant b bowler 14(17) [4s-1]"
4583,"1 run, put down. Maxwell of all people. batsman decides to go onto his back foot, slaps, uppishly without control and extra-cover couldn't have been found any better. Maxwell's surprised too, and the surprise means there's nobody backing up his throw as well"
4584,"no run, now Prithvi. Oh these catches keep going down -- the simplest of them. batsman is foxed by the wrong 'un, again, as he goes deep in the crease to some-sort-cut. Chipped up, straight to extra cover in the ring. Shaw gets both hands, perhaps closing them a little too early. Debut nerves"
4585,"SIX, downtown. Talk about rubbing it in. Two lives, and a celebration with a hoick straight down. All muscle, perbably denting the sightscreen"
4586,"FOUR, another one in anger. Oh bowler, typically after a catch being put down takes his frustration out by going fast, on the pads and batsman cashes in with a sweep, drilling it perfectly to split the two fielders behind square"
4587,"out Caught by Shreyas Iyer!! The time-out syndrome. batsman had to kick on, and he decides to do it with a lofted whip. The ball just doesn't come on, sticks, grabs the inside half of his bat and for a change somebody can catch. But Iyer almost keeps up with the trend - running across from long-on and juggling. Just. batsman c Shreyas Iyer b bowler 34(32) [4s-4]"
4588,"FOUR, to third man, splits the slips. One slower ball too many, batsman's already standing exposing his stumps, swings in desperation and the fat edge is enough to run through the cordon. Who'll plug these in the 18th over .."
4589,"out Caught by Plunkett!! Add another to his repertoire. When he doesn't have the ball in hand, the ball will follow him in the field. A full floater from bowler, inviting an away from the body drive. Sliced uppishly, flat and Plunkett at deep sweeper dives forward. The catches can be taken again. batsman c Plunkett b bowler 26(19) [4s-1 6s-1]"
4590,"leg byes, FOUR, slower in on the pads. Tye can't connect, flicking well before it gets there, rebounds and runs very fine, under Pant's late dive"
4591,"out Caught by Rahul Tewatia!! Wide yorker, well in the allowed-zone this time. batsman stretches, and he knows there's nobody square of the wicket in the deep. All he has to do is clear point. Tries squeezing his steer, but ends up spooning it out to backward point, where Tewatia times his jump superbly, reverse cupping. batsman c Rahul Tewatia b bowler 6(7)"
4592,"FOUR, streaky runs! Terrific end to what has been a sensational over from Avesh. On a good length just outside off, 143.7kph and batsman was late on the forward push. Got a thick inside edge that just flew past leg stump and with fine leg really square, bonus runs for team"
4593,"FOUR, crashed away! Short of a length angling across Mayank, a bit of width and he stands tall to flay the cut through point. Cracking stroke!"
4594,"FOUR, delicious, absolutely delicious stroke! More width and the length is shorter as well, Mayank doesn't go hard at it, instead relies purely on timing and boy, didn't he time this or what? Stays back and guides it past the left of the backward point fielder and it raced away. Third man had no chance at all"
4595,"FOUR, would have been a wide if batsman left this but he chooses to go after it. Didn't time it well enough, still clears the infield on the off-side comfortably. Shorter length slower ball that was lifted over cover"
4596,"out Bowled!! Dragged on. bowler goes back to his trusted full-wide yorker. Tye loads up for yet-another-hoick, giving it his all in his swing. Gets some bat for a change, it's the inside-edge and it's chopped onto off. A four-run-wicket final over, you really can't get greedier. batsman b bowler 3(9)"
4597,"SIX, terrific stroke! batsman is in some serious form and we've seen it already this season. Dug in short and angling into the body, he just shuffles across to get inside the line and uses the pace to control the pull. Easily over fine leg for a biggie"
4598,"FOUR, kabooom! Mayank is off the blocks in a flash once more. Short of a length outside off, he just backs away a bit and hammers it on the up through the covers. Found the gap well and nobody really budged"
4599,"FOUR, up and over! Cannot bowl this length in the Powerplay, not on a true surface like this one. Half-volley and batsman lifts it straight over the bowler's head. Perhaps not middled as much as he would have liked but still got enough on it"
4600,"out Caught by Avesh Khan!! Excellent catch! It's the young man Avesh Khan, you cannot keep him out of the action and this is a massive wicket for DD. The dangerous batsman needs to depart. Clever from bowler, the slower ball on a shorter length and I don't think that batsman picked this variation. Went across on the back foot for the short arm jab but got no pace to work with at all. Mistimed it badly and Avesh at short fine leg judged it brilliantly with a dive forward. Plucked it inches above the ground. Brilliant! batsman c Avesh Khan b bowler 23(15) [4s-3 6s-1]"
4601,"FOUR, glorious! Top quality stuff from batsman! Half volley from Avesh but look at the execution. Textbook front foot cover drive on the up. Brilliantly timed and picked the gap as well"
4602,"FOUR, smart from bowler but Karun is smarter. Slower and short outside off, probably foxed the batsman initially but he adjusted well in the end. Stood tall and waited before guiding it past short third man. Mishra was probably a bit slow as well to come down on the slide and bowler clearly wasn't happy with the effort"
4603,"out Bowled!! The off pole has gone for a walk! What a sight for any fast bowler and bowler is thrilled! Horror stroke from Mayank though and he has wasted another start. Slightly short of a good length around off, this was just above 145kph and that's what probably foxed Mayank who was expecting the slower ball. No excuse for the shot though, a wild slog across the line and misses it completely. Ruffled his pad before crashing into the stumps. DD are right on top here. batsman b bowler 21(16) [4s-3]"
4604,"FOUR, poor delivery to start off. Short and wide outside off, batsman reaches for it and punches it firmly through the gap at cover"
4605,"1 run, dropped? Just grazes his fingertips. Fizzes in the quicker one on a fuller length, SKY got forward and got sucked into the drive, he miscued it off the cue end and the ball just evaded Rashid in his followthrough. He did well to bend low, but just couldn't lock his wrists"
4606,"FOUR, short and wide, Krunal takes full toll of it, rocks back and nails the cut behind square"
4607,"out Lbw!! Much-needed wicket for team. Never looked close to the naked eye, but technology - as ever - always finds a way to surprise us. That quick release off the wrists from bowler, that canny variations off the front of the hand... batsman unfortuantely didn't read it well. Was playing for the ball spinning into him and was a tad late in bringing his bat down. The ball zoomed back in at a rapid pace to catch him close for a lbw call. Not a confident appeal, but team make full use of the DRS system. batsman lbw b bowler 24(20) [4s-4]"
4608,"SIX, full and right in KP's arc, he has no second thoughts. Just dismisses it out of his presence by using those long levers to full effect, sent into the galaxy. Over long-on"
4609,"out Caught by Dhawan!! Reminiscent of Sarfaraz Khan's dismissal against team. Neatly guided down to lone slip. KP hung back to this legbreak and was wanting to glide the ball past the slip, the ball arrives much quicker and lobs low off the splice off the bat. Five down team. Well judged catch from SD considering the pace and height on that. batsman c Dhawan b bowler 9(6) [6s-1]"
4610,"out Caught by Rashid Khan!! Huge wicket in the context of the game. Back of a length, angling into the hip, SKY's eyes lit up on seeing the short ball in that channel and he fell back onto his favourite shot in the cricket dictionary - the whip pull. Hit it too good and looped up in the air for deep square to take a straightforward catch. batsman c Rashid Khan b bowler 34(38) [4s-4]"
4611,"out Lbw!! Nowhere near the line of the delivery, played all around it and was a dead duck. Siddarth Kaul got the ball to hold its line around middle stump and the ball didn't rise as much, batsman was searching for it but couldn't prevent the ball from smashing his pads. Plumb. Just below the knee roll. Umpire S Ravi's finger went up instantly and in the meantime the duo looked to steal a non-existent single. batsman was sent back and had to put in a dive. batsman lbw b bowler 0(2)"
4612,"out Lbw!! Can't get more plumb than that. Easier one for the umpire too. Full and straight from Siddarth Kaul, batsman went for the cross bat shot and missed the line completely. Gets hit low on the pad and looked guilty straightaway. No reviews left for team. Siddarth Kaul is pumped up and so is the entire team team. batsman lbw b bowler 1(2)"
4613,"1 run, half-a-chance. Seam-up delivery, gets great bounce outside off, batsman runs it off the splice of the bat and it evades Dhawan to his right, he dived full length but could only manage a fingertip on that"
4614,"out Caught by Basil Thampi!! Caught at third man. That's the end of batsman and most probably the game for team? Sid Kaul, you bewdy. Look at him go. Oh, give him a machine or else he might end up digging the pitch with his fists. Nice change of pace from him, bowls it far from off-stump of batsman asking him to fetch from there. Pandya slogs and could only lob it as far as third man. Good running catch from Thampi. batsman c Basil Thampi b bowler 3(19)"
4615,"FOUR, angled in, all batsman needed to do was help the ball finds its direction, he swivels and manages decent contact on the pull to slam the ball backwards of square leg"
4616,"out Caught by (sub)Deepak Hooda!! Sunrisers have pulled this off miraculously. Fifth loss for team. Second lowest ever total defended in IPL history. What.A.Thriller. Final wicket razzmatazz: Short ball angled in, batsman top-edged the pull before mid-wicket swallowed the swirling ball. Easy as you like. batsman c (sub)Deepak Hooda b bowler 1(3)"
4617,"FOUR, timed to perfection that was. Short of a length delivery angled away with a bit of away swing too, batsman sits back in his crease and punches it through the gap at cover. Was in the air for a while but the placement was pretty good"
4618,"out Caught by Manish Pandey!! That's a well deserved wicket for Sandeep. batsman never looked comfortable against him. This was another full length delivery with away swing written on it, as batsman tried to flick it away, he got a leading edge to the man at point. Manish wouldn't miss out on that. Another failure for batsman in his maiden IPL season, second on the trot. batsman c Manish Pandey b bowler 5(9) [4s-1]"
4619,"FOUR, shot, good shot! Picks the length early on that. Was a shortish delivery outside off, Suryakumar doesn't miss out on it and slaps it towards mid-off. Thampi who's manning that position slips as the ball beats him and goes through. That won't please the bowler"
4620,"out Caught by (sub)Deepak Hooda!! Duck for Kishan! This is why bowler is in the team. There are many left handed batsmen in Mumbai's batting line-up, gets one of them. Tosses it up nicely and invites the batsman to come down the track. Kishan does so, goes for it and ends up spooning it up to long-off where the sub calls for it and hangs on to it. These wickets are making the match interesting. So far, so good. batsman c (sub)Deepak Hooda b bowler 0(3)"
4621,"out Caught by Dhawan!! Edged and taken! bowler likes that, claps hard after getting the team skipper. A flighted delivery outside off, batsman looks to go big, tries to loft it over the in-field but as the ball turns away, it catches his outside edge and flies straight to the lone fielder in the slip. Dhawan makes no mistake and takes it. Mumbai Indians need a Pollard special tonight, it seems. batsman c Dhawan b bowler 2(6)"
4622,"FOUR, he's been playing so well since he has been promoted. This was played very late by Suryakumar. Was a quicker delivery outside off, he went back in his crease and guided it sweetly past the man at short third man. No chance of stopping that"
4623,"FOUR, back-to-back boundaries for the opener. Picks the length early on the shortish delivery, rocks back and slams it into the gap at cover. Sweeper cover is too square to cut it off as the ball wins the race"
4624,"FOUR, beautiful. What a cracking cover-drive that was. Full length delivery around off, Pandya transfers his weight on his right knee and creams it through cover. Right into the gap and the fielders could do nothing but admire the timing and placement on it"
4625,"FOUR, good competition between bat and ball, this. Short of a length around off, Pandya does well to pummel it past the man at mid-on and get a four more"
4626,"FOUR, poor delivery to end the over. Tries for a yorker and ends up bowling a full toss. Pandya doesn't miss out on the gift and drills it past the diving Williamson to gather the third boundary of the over. Expensive over by Kaul and Mumbai fans get their voice back"
4627,"FOUR, magnificent shot. What a way to get off the mark. Wasn't a bad ball at all. On a back of a length and outside off, with extra bounce too, batsman plays a top square cut, getting on top of the bounce and hitting the gap wide of cover-point"
4628,"FOUR, beauty! batsman is in some form. bowler goes full and outside off, gets a hint of outswing too, batsman though is almost on one knee as he bent forward and then opened the bat-face at the last moment to essay a square drive that left cover-point as a spectator. Not much bowler can do when he gets to see two world-class shots like that. Credit to batsman"
4629,"FOUR, where's third man? No-one there. On a length and outside off, batsman throws the bat at that and the edge flies away to the unmanned third man fence, batsman gets a boundary to get himself going"
4630,"out Bowled!! End of batsman's painful innings. No feet and he is bowled off a thick inside edge onto pad and then falls on the off-stump. bowler is absolutely thrilled to bits. Shouting and screaming in delight. Length delivery on off-stump, batsman gets forward to drive, is late on the shot and the rest is history. batsman b bowler 5(6) [4s-1]"
4631,"no run, that is a very ambitious appeal for lbw. Pathan is a huge man and with that big stride of his, always will get his front foot outside the line, this one is the leggie and the impact looks outside off and what's more it is spinning away. Hang on - team have taken the review. Could well lose it. Replays show that the impact is outside off and that's team's review gone down the gutter"
4632,"out Bowled!! batsman doesn't want to go. But he has to. He has been bowled here. He can't believe that the ball has hit the stumps. Superb googly, tossed up and invited batsman to play the big shot. An almighty hoick to leg but only after the ball has missed the inside edge and clipped the top of middle and leg. Top-class bowling. batsman b bowler 14(10) [4s-2]"
4633,"FOUR, poor delivery and cut away. Short and wide outside off, Pathan had to miss backward point and he did that. Races away once it moved past that fielder"
4634,"out Caught by Ishan Kishan!! Gone. bowler jumps up and down in delight. Angled in on a short of length on off, batsman was trying to run it down between the keeper and the wide slip. But finds Ishan Kishan who hangs on. He is catching all the snicks tonight, apart from those, his keeping has been shoddy. batsman c Ishan Kishan b bowler 6(9)"
4635,"out Bowled!! Looks like batsman has only one shot in his arsenal. The cut. Very risky against a promising bowler. The leg-spinner fizzes off the deck and beats the late-cut, knocks the off-stump back. Not a very wise shot when he should be looking to give the strike to Pathan. batsman b bowler 3(6)"
4636,"out batsman Run Out!! Confusion. Chaos. Gone. Long way out too. Finally Kaul gets bat on ball, driven to backward point where there's a slight fumble, Kaul is desperate to get to the other end, Pathan sends him back but Pandya has all the time to direct his throw back to Ishan Kishan who does the rest, even as he almost lost the ball while attempting the run-out. After he flicked the bails off, the ball slipped out. The third umpire completes the formalities. batsman run out (Hardik Pandya/Ishan Kishan) 2(9)"
4637,"SIX, a smile from KW after that big hit. On a length and around off, too predictable these cutters from bowler, Pathan stays back and lofts cleanly miles into the stands at long-on"
4638,out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! Good catch and that's the end of the innings. Pathan really smashed the pull but Rohit has kept all his athletic fielders on the fence. Hardik at deep mid judges it to a nicety as he takes it reverse-cup over his head. A smile breaks out after he completes the catch. Pathan can't believe that he hasn't cleared the fielder. batsman c Hardik Pandya b bowler 29(33) [4s-2 6s-1]
4639,"out Caught by Ishan Kishan!! batsman walks. And Mumbai erupt. No need for the review as well. Similar to the last delivery, but a bit wide, batsman again reached out with his hands with the feet stuck, all he managed was an edge to the keeper. Ishan Kishan makes no mistake and the ploy to send batsman at 3 has backfired badly. batsman c Ishan Kishan b bowler 0(2)"
4640,"FOUR, a big confidence-booster for batsman. He wants runs and this is a fine shot. On the front foot and when he saw the back of a length delivery outside off, just knifed it on the rise. Through the vacant cover-point region for a boundary"
4641,"FOUR, when it is pitched up, batsman looks to go over the top. Has come out with an aggressive intent. This was full outside off, he lofted it cleanly and wide of mid-on"
4642,"FOUR, clean and over mid-off. The same delivery that got Saha, but batsman is in and seeing it well tonight by the looks of it. Goes over mid-off with a full bat-swing and clears the fielder comfortably"
4643,"FOUR, batsman gets lucky. Very lucky. A thick inside edge that on another day would've gone onto the stumps, misses them and runs away wide of short fine leg. The fielder didn't dive as well. Good length and on off, batsman was late on the attempted dab"
4644,"out Caught by Rohit!! ""Story of batsman"" is the comment from Sanjay M on air. Apt. Finds cover. Down the track and right off the toe of the bat, can only find the team skipper there. Clever from bowler, may have seen the batsman coming and bowled it just a bit wide from his reach. An innings which promised so much has been nipped in the bud. batsman c Rohit b bowler 16(11) [4s-3]"
4645,"out Shakib Run Out!! batsman has sold Shakib down the river here. batsman turned this to the short mid area and said an yes, Shakib too responded and then the team skipper belted out a loud no. By then Shakib was almost halfway down and Surya took his time, aimed and hit direct. What a waste of a wicket. Shakib is too disappointed to say anything. Just walks off. Shakib run out (Suryakumar Yadav) 2(4)"
4646,"byes, FOUR, short, Pathan ducks under that and lets it go. Ishan Kishan is having a bad day in the office tonight. Leaps but can only parry it over and the ball runs away for four byes. Again off bowler"
4647,"FOUR, brilliant back-cut. As late as possible. batsman cutting the ball behind him and the pace on the ball beats the chasing and diving McClenaghan. Top shot that one"
4648,"FOUR, comical from KW. He hasn't realised that the ball has crossed the fence. Keeps running and then belatedly realises. But what a good pull shot that is. Rocketed off the bat, harmless short ball around waist height, batsman murdered that and bisected the two men on the fence. Even a dive wasn't enough to stop the ball"
4649,"out Caught by Ishan Kishan!! batsman walks. Clear inside edge and the umpire's finger is up too. Nipped in a tad, from a good length, batsman had his bat face open to play the dab to third man, but it kissed the inside edge and went to the keeper. That's a wicket team ill-afforded to lose. Massive blow. batsman c Ishan Kishan b bowler 29(21) [4s-5]"
4650,"FOUR, can't seem to string 6 good balls in an over. Overpitched and batsman doesn't miss out. Gets forward and strokes it wide of cover. Sweeper had no chance at all. Right off the middle of the bat"
4651,"FOUR, too short and begging to be hit. batsman rocks back and finds the gap between long-on and deep mid with a hard pull. Right into the gap"
4652,"FOUR, googly but wrongly directed, starts from middle and goes down, Pathan helps the sweep with one hand off the bat handle, good enough though to take the ball away from the man at deep backward square"
4653,"SIX, that's batsman at his best. Too full and too straight, batsman sits down and then heaves with all his might, good connection to get it all the way over long-on. Gets the crowd going"
4654,"out Caught by Siraj!! How often have you seen batsman get out, mistiming a pull? His staple shot is the pull. Made a career out of it as a batsman even fetching length balls and muscling them over mid-wicket. But bowler has him again. Credit to Kohli for throwing the ball to the left-arm spinner, he has a good record against batsman and gets him with a short ball. May have skidded on a wee bit to catch batsman's inner half, Siraj takes a dolly at mid-on and flings the ball away. bowler raises his arms in triumph. batsman c Siraj b bowler 7(4) [6s-1]"
4655,"SIX, right in batsman's teeing off zone. Picks the slower delivery and murders it over long-on. As easy as you like"
4656,"SIX, helicoptered straight down the ground! Mini-helicopter you can call. Tossed up on middle, batsman marmalises it back over the bowler's head. Such power"
4657,"SIX, bowler continues to toss it up, too full and right in the hitting zone, batsman swings and sends it over long-on. When it is so full, batsman will hit everything out of the park"
4658,"SIX, 50 for batsman. He is getting tired and losing some of his power, but this he sits back and waits for it to be bowled short, then mauls the pull over deep mid. Third six of the over"
4659,"SIX, magnificent shot. Down the track and lifts the back of a length delivery over deep cover. So effortless with so much timing. A crucial blow at the right time"
4660,"1 run, dropped by Umesh at extra-cover. Kohli though claps in encouragement. batsman moved across to the off-side, skied the lofted hit straight up. Umesh went for the conventional way, straight in and out. Will that prove to be costly?"
4661,"SIX, back of a length outside off, batsman knows what is coming, a mini shuffle outside off, forehands it over wide long-off. Carries over the rope, not by much but it will do"
4662,"SIX, this is bigger. And longer. Full outside off, batsman shuffles across and gives it all, off the middle of the bat and way back into the stands. Nailed that and the ball flies away to the deep mid fence"
4663,"FOUR, finally, he guides this in the gap and that spoils a good over for bowler. Bowled pretty well to be honest. Back of a length and outside off stump, batsman steers it between backward point and short third man"
4664,"SIX, whyyy! When those back of a length balls were working so well, why do you want to try the yorker. batsman smacks it. He did really smack it straight down the ground. Fifty for the team captain, he's determined and as always confident"
4665,"FOUR, now then, now then, you can't bowl way too short and slow either. No sweeper cover remember, only third man and deep cover, so batsman stands tall, delays the cut and hits it over the infield"
4666,"out batsman Run Out!! 1 run completed. They say you don't run on a misfield and batsman's excellent knock has been ended by a brilliant piece of fielding by Umesh. Brilliant first with the full length dive to get a hand on the attempted square-drive to save the boundary, and then brilliant with recovery time and more importantly smash the stumps with a bullet throw and he had one stump to aim at from a side on angle. team are back in it! batsman doesn't want to leave. He got greedy and hoped for a poor throw from the fielder but Umesh has a good throwing arm and was out by miles despite a dive. batsman run out (U Yadav) 82(53) [4s-3 6s-8]"
4667,"SIX, don't tell me he deliberately sliced that all the way for six! Oh he did! Genius! Low full toss outside off stump, not a really bad ball, batsman has been looking to target third man this innings and he's somehow got under this properly and sent it for a maximum"
4668,"FOUR, that's the healthiest of edges you can get. Lucky runs. Precious runs for team. The yellow contingent believes. Ceee Esss Kayyy chants ringing in the ground. Shortish delivery outside off stump, Bravo slogs and gets a thick edge that flies over the leaping QdK"
4669,"SIX, who better than DJ Bravo to hit those inside-out shots over cover. You got to admire him. Distraught team fans. Delight in the team camp. Back of a length delivery outside off stump, Bravo backs away and gets under the ball to smash it over cover"
4670,"SIX, that's it! How cool is he man! Is he human? team have won with two balls to spare! Unbelievable stuff. More than 100 runs were needed in about 7 overs but he never showed any signs of pressure, nor did he play rash shots. Just played his trumpcard of taking the match deep and backing himself to finish and boy, what a finish it was. Just a jump across to the off-side and slogs this full ball with all his might to clear deep mid-wicket. This is team's first loss defending in excess of 200 at the Chinnaswamy"
4671,"SIX, the sound of bat hitting ball was like a gunshot. Such a big hit and so well hit too. After not getting to the pitch, bowler seeing batsman come down, dragged it down, but batsman is seeing so well at the moment that he goes through with the pull and muscles it over deep mid"
4672,"SIX, good cricket awareness from batsman as he knew bowler will pitch it up, he does and batsman swings through the line and cleanly to get another six over long-on"
4673,"SIX, he is in the mood. For sure. A length ball angling in, batsman stays back and just whips that off his pads, knew there was no-one back out there, the white ball sails into the crowd at deep backward square"
4674,"FOUR, that is an unbelievable shot. Especially if your name is batsman and you have a problem against the short ball. The world knows it. Yadav did nothing wrong there, followed the backing away batsman with a perfect short ball, but batsman turned on the style and forehanded like Rafa Nadal at Philippe Chatrier Roland Garros. So much topspin on the crosscourt and it swings and eludes wickedly past the great AB at mid-on. How he managed to get on top of the bounce and kept it down, only he will know"
4675,"FOUR, short and pulled away. batsman didn't hit it as well as he would've liked to, but gets a one bounce over the ropes four at deep square"
4676,"FOUR, another amazing shot by batsman. bowler with the double-teapot pose, wondering what he has done wrong. batsman down the track, in a flash and even when there's no room on the back of a length delivery, whiplashes the slash, gets it through cover and extra-cover. Right into the gap. Top batting"
4677,"FOUR, belted straight down the ground. batsman knows what is coming from his Hyderabad teammate. Skips down and then brutalises the short of length delivery back over the bowler's head. Umpire was ducking for cover there"
4678,"out Caught by Mandeep!! The shouts of Ceeee-Sssss-Kkkkkkk have been drowned out by that wicket. Now Aaaaarrrrr-Ceeeeee-Beeeeeee back on. Leg-stump full delivery, hint of shape on that, batsman flicked too early and the leading edge landed safely in backward point's grasp where Mandeep catches and tumbles over in delight. The ploy of giving Yadav another over has worked. 100th IPL wicket for Umesh as well. batsman c Mandeep b bowler 11(9) [4s-2]"
4679,"FOUR, now batsman flicks and gets four. Over mid-wicket and it races away. On the pads, batsman relies on timing and goes up and over"
4680,"FOUR, pre-meditated and four. Knelt down and paddled it fine, beats the long chase and desperate dive of Corey Anderson at fine leg. Almost played it onto the stumps, but got it wide of de Kock"
4681,"out Stumped!! Gone. bowler is shushing batsman as he puts his finger to his lips. Magnificent bowling. Done batsman in with his quickish, flattish leggie, batsman was down the track and looking to play across the line, dangerous, deadly dangerous when it spins past you like that leaving you hopeless and helpless. Easy for de Kock to complete the formalities. bowler is jumping up and down like a young child who has been denied his icecream. batsman st de Kock b bowler 9(7) [4s-2]"
4682,"SIX, goes over deep cover. batsman didn't find it off the middle of the bat, but has got enough bat to send the ball soaring into the crowd over deep cover. Tough tough shot but batsman trusted his ability and played it supremely"
4683,"out Bowled!! He is punching the air as if he was a boxer beating the hell out of your defeated opponent. What bowling from bowler. He is turning it on for team. That's as comprehensive as it gets. Sets batsman up for the cut but the ball fizzes off the pitch and beats the shot to clatter the stumps. batsman is not a bad player of spin, just the quality of bowler outshining and outsmarting the spinner. Now team are well on top. batsman b bowler 3(5)"
4684,"SIX, crikey! We have seen everything from MS in this game. Never will play the big shot off just his second ball, but here he has done so and got six. Down the track to the tossed up delivery on leg, heaves into the deep mid fence. Off the mark with a biggie"
4685,"FOUR, that's where batsman is so good. Anything near his pads and he will not allow the bowler to get away. Full on leg stump and he just whipped it over mid-wicket. The uncorking of the wrists and the ball flew over the fielder"
4686,"FOUR, didn't get all of it, but with the infield up, anything over them will be a boundary. Full outside off, batsman wanted to go over extra-cover with the lofted hit, sort of sliced it, but had enough on it to clear the ring. Races away and the crowd get going as well"
4687,"FOUR, what batting. Must have picked it from the hand. Reverses the bat and sends the quicker dart outside off wide of short third. MS tried to get his legs in the way of the ball - as he always does, but placed so well"
4688,"SIX, there comes the sweep. He has got outside the line as he sits and then takes it from around fourth stump line, sweeps and connects beautifully, sends it into the deep backward square leg fence. The ball just flew off the bat"
4689,"SIX, the ball is lost! Find a new one. If someone is outside the stadium near the deep mid stands, they can take that as a souvenir. And frame it and keep it for posterity sake. batsman does a Guptill as he sits down and then does not keep his eyes on the shot, the head looks down and the eyes away from the line of where the ball is going, where's the ball? Over the roof at deep mid. One hit in the last game came back in from there, but this is isn't. Monster hit! My colleague Akshay tells me that it is a 111-metre six - the biggest of the tournament so far"
4690,"SIX, massive blow and batsman likes that. Has 50 and points at the base of his bat to someone in the dressing room. All done with a smile on his face. Makes room and the length ball is clattered miles into the deep mid-wicket stands. More of a golf-swing that from batsman"
4691,"SIX, now 50 for AB. Just a raise of the bat and a glove-punch with de Kock to celebrate getting there. Picks the slower delivery and heaves it into the deep mid stands. The key was standing still and then going through with the shot"
4692,"SIX, another slower delivery and another six. Predictable from Thakur. Again batsman stays so still, doesn't move around at all, over long-on now. Clean and beautiful"
4693,"SIX, Thakur isn't learning at all. Third slower delivery, this was the knuckle delivery, he is overdoing it, batsman may have seen what he is doing, even if he hasn't, can pick it from the hand, the slower delivery lands outside off and with a swing of the bat, the ball is seen flying over wide long-off. What can this man not do on a cricket field? Absolutely nothing"
4694,"out Caught&Bowled!! Right off the toe of the bat and bowler catches it. Out comes the dance. A slower ball, batsman had to wait an age for the ball to arrive, by the time he completed the shot, it chalked the cue end and found the bowler. A wicket team so desperately needed. They break the stand that was threatening to consume them. batsman c and b bowler 53(37) [4s-1 6s-4]"
4695,"out Caught by Billings!! Someone please stop bowler. Or he will run all the way from the Stadium to Chennai. Thankfully a team teammate does stop him. He has gone mental. But deserved wicket for him and credit to MS too for giving the field to him. Wanted bowler to toss it up outside off, out of batsman's reach. Must have expected batsman to go for it after just four came off the last ten balls. And it works. batsman wants to go in-to-out, but the spin away forces the miscue, and they have one of the best fielders in the team in Billings at deep cover, running in to settle under that. Pressure catch but he hangs on and sends the team section into pangs of uncontrolled emotion. batsman c Billings b bowler 68(30) [4s-2 6s-8]"
4696,"out Caught by Harbhajan!! bowler does run this time, but only halfway of the ground. Two in two and how quickly has this game turned. Googly, on a punching length, but it turns just a wee bit more than batsman expected, catches the edge and surprisingly there's a slip in for the Kiwi at this stage. Another masterstroke by MS and Bhajji is only too happy to gobble it up. Again what emotion and what drama at the Chinnaswamy. batsman c Harbhajan b bowler 2(8)"
4697,"byes, FOUR, wow! Missed stumping? What has happened to this game all of a sudden. Like a man on drugs. This ball opens batsman up completely, rips off middle and squares up the batsman, leaves MS clueless too, drift in and spin away, past everyone including slip and races away"
4698,"SIX, almost an unbelievable catch. Boult snatched one in the last game. Billings just missing out with an incredible effort. Slogged in the air from outside off and Billings on the run from deep mid, stretched his right-hand out at full tilt but took the ball with him beyond the ropes. Had he caught that, would've been one of the all-time great catches"
4699,"FOUR, too slow and too much time for batsman to reverse lap it over short third. Well played"
4700,"2 runs, poor from bowler and the man at cover, slower ball bowled on a yorker length outside off, dug out to the diving MS, who with his glove on has a shy and had he hit de Grandhomme was out. But there's no backing up and they take an extra run"
4701,"1 run, difficult return catch dropped. Drilled and hit with power to the left-hand of bowler, it didn't stick. Must have stung him, but he doesn't show any emotion"
4702,"FOUR, top shot. Gets under this full delivery and manages to power it over mid-off. Well wide of him and four more"
4703,"SIX, brilliant shot. He is backing away and having to reach out but awesome timing on the lofted square drive. It was full and outside his reach, but somehow batsman got it over the deep point fence. All timing and the crowd have found their voice back"
4704,"SIX, bit of TR from Bumble. ""batsman, batsman, goes deep."" is his comment on air. Sheer power from batsman, waits for the shortish slower delivery, then flat-bats it with brute force and clears long-off easily. The key was knowing what Thakur will bowl and setting himself up for the shot. Perfectly executed"
4705,out Caught by Jadeja!! Straight up in the air and caught at deep mid. batsman slogs the slower delivery and doesn't have the elevation to clear the fielder in the deep. Respite for Thakur who has had an absolute mare tonight - removing the wicket-maiden against Kohli and AB. batsman c Jadeja b bowler 32(17) [4s-1 6s-3]
4706,"out de Grandhomme Run Out!! de Grandhomme isn't the quickest between the wickets. MS hits direct and there's no dive from the Kiwi. batsman is beaten on the dab to the slower delivery, MS does the rest with the gloves on. de Grandhomme run out (Dhoni) 11(7) [4s-1]"
4707,"out Negi Run Out!! 1 run completed. Madness from team and they have lost three in three. Team hat-trick. Lofted by batsman without any power, to the right of long-off. Negi wanted to come back for the second, but is sent back and can't beat the accurate throw on the bounce to MS. Flat and rocket-like by Jadeja. Negi isn't happy and is seen chuntering away in the dug-out. Negi run out (Jadeja/Dhoni) 0(1)"
4708,"out Caught by Billings!! It is four in four, in between a wide too. Manic this. Madness. Sheer madness. Yadav skies the slower delivery way up in the air, when it came down, it was Billings under it at deep mid. batsman c Billings b bowler 0(1)"
4709,"wide, had MS hit direct, would've been four in four. What was Yadav doing? Was a wide and he was loitering outside his crease. MS missed without the glove and not by much. Very lazy and poor by Umesh"
4710,"SIX, just over Tahir at deep mid. batsman slogging the slower delivery and managing to clear the leggie, when he hit it, looked like he holed out. Enough, just about to get a biggie"
4711,"SIX, mauls this slower delivery over long-on. Made slight room to the off-pace delivery and then freed his arms to go big. Connected cleanly and there was never a doubt about the hit"
4712,"FOUR, 200 marks to Billings for the effort. But it is four. Flicked effortlessly by batsman, races across the turf to deep mid-wicket, Billings dives and pushes it back in play, but the ball rolls back to touch the cushions as the Kent man tried to pull it back the second time. batsman and de Kock assumed that it would go for four and had to rush to make the third. Eventually all that was not needed as the third umpire judges it correctly"
4713,"FOUR, brilliant from batsman. These might be crucial runs. Could well be match-winning. This 10-odd runs he has managed in the last over. Wide length ball from bowler, batsman reached out and cut between the two men in the ring on the off-side. No-one sweeping out there and team end with 205"
4714,"SIX, batsman has seen enough. Decides to take matters into his own hands. Such a difficult shot to play - against the spin to a turning ball, but batsman nailed the shot to perfection. Down the track and to the pitch before hoisting it long over long-on. Again timed so well and it went way back into the stands"
4715,"out Caught by Jadeja!! Thakur strikes. What a big wicket too. Quite uncharacteristic from batsman to get out to one of his favorite shots. Took a step down the track and whipped that with lots of bottom hand power, failed to keep it down and found team's best fielder Jadeja at mid-on. He judges it beautifully and slides to take it with two hands. If there was one fielder, batsman didn't want the ball to go to, then it must have been Jadeja. batsman is livid with himself, bangs the bat hard into his pad and trudges off. The team contingent erupt. batsman c Jadeja b bowler 18(15) [4s-3]"
4716,"SIX, batsman wants to make an impact. Takes on long-on and goes over his head. Uses his feet and then a clean swing of the bat. Rest you know. Sails into the stands. So effortless"
4717,"SIX, he played an absolute beauty of a shot against Nadeem in the last game. Does the same here. Makes room and goes in-to-out - one of the toughest shots in the business but batsman is a genius, makes it look so simple. Over extra-cover and just crosses the ropes for six. The crowd have gone mad at the Chinnaswamy"
4718,"FOUR, this time shows off his prowess over the backward point region. bowler isn't afraid to flight it, even after getting hit, but batsman backs away and slices it over the infield, four more, just opened the bat face at the point of impact and eluded the horde of fielders in the ring"
4719,"SIX, wow. So easy this is for batsman that it is absolutely ridiculous. Other mortals would have attempted to drive that through cover, but when batsman saw that tossed up delivery outside off he went down on his knee and swept it flat over deep square leg. The fielder was behind square and could only watch the ball go into the cushions"
4720,"FOUR, back of a length around off, what a late-cut that is. Played it so late, almost behind him, splits backward point and short third to perfection. No third man and too wide for sweeper to get across"
4721,"SIX, straight back over bowler's head. Over the sightscreen. Picks the bones out of this slower delivery, stays till and smashes the ball for a biggie"
4722,"2 runs, jams out the yorker which is headed for the base of off, to the right of Billings at sweeper cover. Placed for two"
4723,"SIX, down the track he comes and clobbers it! Just a casual swing of the arms to send it rocketing back over the bowler's head"
4724,"out Caught by Manish Pandey!! Down the pitch and gone! Wasn't anywhere near the pitch of the ball, but refuses to arrest his momentum; goes through with the shot and skies it off the cue end for long-on who takes the simplest of catches. Manish Pandey it is with bucket hands. Mayank's intent was to clear long-on with the loft, but bowler did well to drag it back. batsman c Manish Pandey b bowler 12(15)"
4725,"out Lbw!! batsman doesn't review. Plumb in front. Googly from bowler, batsman got forward to block ala classic Test match style, but he didn't read it too well. Was totally befuddled after he got pinged below the kneeroll. batsman walks off instantly. batsman lbw b bowler 13(17)"
4726,"SIX, in the slot and goodnight! Fuller in length and batsmany likes it, tonks it many-a-mile over long-on"
4727,"out Caught by Manish Pandey!! Gone this time. Headless batting from batsman? Rush of blood? Preempts the lofted swing and smashes it as hard as he can, puts all his body power behind it after clearing the front leg. Manish Pandey sets himself up at long-on and judges it to perfection. Taken inches inside the rope. batsman c Manish Pandey b bowler 8(4) [6s-1]"
4728,"out Caught by Williamson!! Give Williamson 10 bowlers and he'll win matches. Gee, how good is this team bowling? team 6 down. Sheer panic. batsman got across to this off-cutter and couldn't control his flick shot on the move, foxed by the lack of pace I reckon. It smacks the toe-end and loops up to KW at mid-wicket who gobbles up with supreme ease. batsman c Williamson b bowler 1(5)"
4729,"FOUR, dropped? Just fingertips I guess. Will go down as a missed opportunity. batsman walks out of his crease and clubs it straight down the ground, it kept teasing long-on and long-off, in the end Shakib from long-on decided to go for it, but didn't judge it well and it looped over his left shoulder"
4730,"out Lbw!! They are crumbling like nine pins. One after the other. There's no room to breathe. Knuckle ball from bowler, Tye played across the line and got hit in line with middle and leg. Loud appeal and given out straightaway. Tye went for the review after a brief consultation with his skipper, thankfully they didn't lose the review. batsman lbw b bowler 4(2) [4s-1]"
4731,"out batsman Run Out!! This is possibly the worst batting display from team this season. They are inviting panic ball after ball. Sran slogs once again, gets it off the toe-end and it dribbles to Saha to his left; he puts in the dive, collects cleanly and clatters the timber at the striker's end. Both the batsmen were stranded in the middle, Ashwin took a couple of strides and stood stoned midway waiting to see the procession. batsman run out (Saha) 2(5)"
4732,"out Caught by Williamson!! Running out of words to describe this shambolic batting from team. batsman goes for the hack and had to drag it off the toe-end, the ball was spinning away from him and that made it all the more difficult to execute the shot. Skies up off the toe-end and KW takes a sitter at cover. batsman c Williamson b bowler 4(6)"
4733,"FOUR, okay let's try something fancy decides batsman and he goes for the reverse slap over point. Connects it well and gets it to defeat the dive from sweeper cover to his left"
4734,"FOUR, another reverse slap. Over short third man this time. Sweetly timed or not, it goes over the fielder and trickles into the fence"
4735,"FOUR, typical agricultural slog from Ankit batsman, shaves the inside edge and runs past the keeper to his left. Thampi from short fine chases...chases...and chases...Never getting there. Ball wins the race"
4736,"out Bowled!! Stumps shattered, so is the team dug-out. team win, by 13 runs. What an outstanding bowling effort this. This (the final wicket) was coming; bowler gets his line right and attacks the stumps with a full one, it was pacy and too hot to handle for Ankit batsman, he went across his stumps to try the funky scoop over short fine and missed. Nailed, done and dusted. Timbahhhh...batsman b bowler 8(9) [4s-1]"
4737,"SIX, deep into the mid-wicket stands. He pounces on this short ball. Picks length up strikingly early, hops back and nails the pull away"
4738,"FOUR, superb batting. This isn't all that short. But batsman's footwork is excellent, enabling him to spear this cut shot through point"
4739,"FOUR, now anticipates a slightly fuller length, walks across the stumps and sweeps over short fine leg. Class batting from batsman. He's out-thinking bowler at every turn"
4740,"FOUR, batsman silences the crowd with a glorious cover drive. Wow. Not even all that full, but he leans into it languidly and creams it through extra cover"
4741,"FOUR, he's not got it off the middle, but the fact he's got it over mid-on is incredible. He wasn't to the pitch of the ball after charging out, but goes through with a very stylish straight-batted punch. His strokes make for such good viewing"
4742,"FOUR, yorker outside off, and it's sliced away through the gap. batsman stretches out to reach it and opens the bat-face to get it between short third man and backward point"
4743,"SIX, you brutal brutal beast. Clears his front leg and destroys this back of length delivery. It's gone soaring over long-on. Phew, enough to knock the wind out of a bowler"
4744,"out Bowled!! batsman has this weakness against legspin. He does have a history of getting out to googlies in the past. Perhaps that could be playing on his mind while playing the wily bowler. Got forward defensively expecting a wrong 'un, but the ball held its line enough before straightening past his outside edge to hammer the off pole. Excellent set up from Rashid. A much-needed wicket for team and with that, they take the time-out! batsman b bowler 32(26) [4s-4 6s-1]"
4745,"out Caught&Bowled!! Guess what, the young man from Kerala has beaten Chris batsman for pace. The advantage of that busting action and jump. Gets the short ball to climb awkwardly onto batsman who miscues the ambitious pull round the corner, just a few yards to the left of nonexistent square leg. bowler says mine, runs around and controls his momentum to take a clean catch. Boy, is he pumped or what... batsman c and b bowler 23(22) [4s-1 6s-2]"
4746,"out Caught by Ashwin!! The team supporters look stunned as the captain departs. That's a poor looking shot from KW, but it was the extra bounce that was his undoing. Banged in short and a hint of away movement from outside off, KW was in a terrible position as he went for the pull, would have been better had he tried to cut, gets a top-edge that lobbed in the air and Ashwin has a simple catch at mid-off. batsman c Ashwin b bowler 0(3)"
4747,"FOUR, cracking shot, width on offer from Sran and batsman was all over it. Reaches out on the drive and flat-bats it past cover, beat the infield and rolled away to the fence"
4748,"FOUR, nicely played by batsman, much needed boundary for team. Banged in short and just outside off, batsman swivels across and helps it on its way, beats short fine and rolls away to the fence"
4749,"1 run, tossed up on the stumps, Manish backs away and punches it to long-off for a single"
4750,"out Caught by Mayank Agarwal!! This was coming! batsman was struggling to get the young Afghan away, goes for the big mow over mid-wicket and holes out to long-on. He didn't pick this wrong 'un, came down the track, didn't get anywhere close to the ball, was eyeing the mid-wicket fence, got a fat leading edge on the lofted drive, high and towards long-on. Mayank settled under it and holds on. batsman c Mayank Agarwal b bowler 28(29) [4s-3]"
4751,"FOUR, bad misjudgement from Rajpoot in the deep. He lets this bounce in front of him and then weakly stretches out his hand, only to parry it over the ropes. Carrom ball on leg-stump from bowler, Pandey stood still and swiped it through square leg. Good contact"
4752,"SIX, he's tonked this over mid-wicket. Finally the acceleration from Pandey. Picks the ball from outside off and slogs cleanly"
4753,"1 run, dropped! It took an age for the ball to come down from the sky, and it bursts right through Agarwal's hands in the deep. Another big swipe from Pandey which he mistimes to deep mid-wicket. And another repreive"
4754,"SIX, another one goes down, albeit a much difficult one. Mistimed slog from Pathan, Manoj Tiwary skirts along the square leg boundary, and then tips it over the ropes. His mind was occupied by his proximity to the ropes which made him fluff the chance too"
4755,"FOUR, had to make a big effort to get to this wide slower ball, and then manufactures remarkable power to cover it over extra-cover. Highly valuable fifty from batsman. It's given the Sunrisers a score"
4756,"FOUR, back of a length delivery on leg, Pathan helps it away past short fine leg. Tye immediately turned away, knew he had missed his mark horrendously"
4757,"out Bowled!! Brilliant bowling. Turning out to be a great final over so far. He's varied it up nicely, so as to not become predictable. This one's almost in the blockhole and it's tailing in at a good pace. Slips under Pandey's slog and crashes into the stumps off the pad. batsman b bowler 54(51) [4s-3 6s-1]"
4758,"FOUR, sliced away over backward point for four. Useful from batsman. Full and wide delivery, batsman just about reaches it and then cleverly opens the bat face"
4759,"FOUR, that's a poor ball from Sran, too full and on batsman's pads, all he had to do was to get some bat on that, he does and beats fine leg with ease. Expensive start from Sran, 11 came from the over"
4760,"FOUR, chopped, short of a good length and just outside off, too close for batsman to play the cut, he gets a toe-edge and beats the lone slip, third man is square and has no chance"
4761,"out Caught by Nair!! Edged and caught! That bounce from bowler, it's the undoing of yet another team batsman, they have lost both openers now. Banged in short and curving away from the left-hander, batsman didn't cover for the angle as he fended at that, doesn't get on top of the bounce and gets a thick outside edge. The ball looped and was dying on its way to Karun, but he bends forward and takes a good low catch. batsman c Nair b bowler 11(8) [4s-2]"
4762,"out Caught by Mayank Agarwal!! Lofted up, not much timing, and a good catch running in from Agarwal. He covered decent ground at long-off before diving forward with both hands. Five-fer for Ankit bowler. batsman c Mayank Agarwal b bowler 4(2) [4s-1]"
4763,"FOUR, whipped, length delivery on the leg-stumnp line, Manish makes room, gets his left leg out of the way and flicks it wristily past mid-wicket, off the mark with a boundary"
4764,"2 runs, chance and Ashwin puts in a laborious dive, don't think he even got his fingers onto the ball. A badly mistimed shovel from Manish as he looked to go back over the bowler's head, went very high and over mid-off. Ashwin ran back, kept his eyes on the ball, stretched out as it lobbed over his shoulders and can't quite complete the catch"
4765,"out Caught by Andrew Tye!! Another terrible slog and bowler has three now. Change of pace has done batsman in, this was a slower ball outside off, batsman was looking to slog it over mid-wicket, he has no pace to work with, hit high on the bat and lobs a simple catch to Tye, jogging back from mid-wicket. bowler is on a roll and team's batting looks very flaky once again. batsman c Andrew Tye b bowler 6(9) [4s-1]"
4766,"no run, chance and Tye has dropped a dolly. That should have been four for bowler, short and just outside off, Manish swivelled across and nailed the pull, straight into the hands of Tye at mid-wicket - who somehow clangs a sitter"
4767,"FOUR, the free-hit and it has been smashed away, high full-toss on batsman's pads, he pulled it without much timing, but the placement was good, past square leg and into the fence"
4768,"FOUR, short, wide and four, batsman gets going after some luck, short and wide of off, he gets on top of the bounce, used Sran's pace and cracked it square behind point. Third man has no chance"
4769,"1 run, appeal for run-out. A lazy single from batsman and this might cost him. Oh dear! batsman is short, but bowler has missed the ball and broke the stumps with his hands, NOT OUT is the call. That's poor cricket all around, the drifter from bowler, spun away from outside off, Hasan pushed it to the right of cover-point and set-off for a quick single. He was very casual in his running, took the big steps when he spotted the danger, but was still short of making his ground"
4770,"SIX, smashed, that's a long hop from Kuldeep, it was the attempted wrong 'un, sat up to be smacked. batsman stayed back and flat-batted the pull, high and over long-on for a maximum"
4771,"FOUR, cracking shot! This lad is putting up an exhibition tonight. Fractionally short from Russell and Shaw doesn't bother going on the back foot. Is on his initial front foot trigger as he clobbers the pull over mid-wicket. High quality!"
4772,"1 run, short of a length and just outside off, guided down towards third man. 50 for batsman! Joint youngest to score an IPL fifty. No surprises there if you have heard of him before. A definite prodigy"
4773,"FOUR, oh glorious! Another classy stroke! Not all that full but Shaw reaches out and absolutely pumps the drive straight back past the bowler. Mid-off could only see it whistling away to the fence. Gee!"
4774,"SIX, ahh, the new DD captain doesn't think so. What a way to greet the mystery spinner in his new spell! Floated up around off, Iyer did well to go with the spin and executed the slog sweep beautifully. Easily over deep mid-wicket"
4775,"FOUR, this time he does! Iyer gets third time lucky. Another shorter length delivery from bowler and was perhaps a touch closer to Iyer who connected the ramp nicely. Over Karthik and very fine which means third man has no chance. Nice innovation"
4776,"SIX, launched over square leg! Shaw continues in his merry ways. Fractionally short in length and he swivels a touch before propelling this with a strong bottom hand. In the air for quite a while and had enough legs to clear the fence. He is switching gears here, is Shaw and DD do need to up the ante. Looks a good batting surface"
4777,"SIX, that's H-U-G-E! Into the top tier! Whoa, what a strike! Iyer has decided to join in the fun as well. Tossed up nicely by bowler and it's blasted high down the ground. One of those sixes that had good height and distance. Lovely"
4778,"out Bowled!! bowler strikes! team badly needed this one because this partnership was getting ready to go bonkers. This was the quicker one from bowler and it skidded through low, Shaw didn't expect it to keep that low and his wild pull across the line didn't help his cause either. Misses it completely and the woodwork is disturbed. Nevertheless, a top quality innings from the young man. He's made a statement here in the IPL. This dismissal might actually worry team as they have to chase and it has started to keep low. batsman b bowler 62(44) [4s-7 6s-2]"
4779,"out Caught by Karthik!! What was that, Mr.batsman? We have seen Indian batsmen get out to the bouncer but trust me, this has to be one of weirdest ways of getting out. Lovely bouncer and batsman was stuck on the crease, probably beaten for both pace and bounce. Fails to drop his wrists in time and it flies high off the glove. It's a dolly for the team skipper and suddenly, the visitors are right back in this with the twin strikes. The in-form batsman has to go. He has a wry smile on his face as he walks back. Knows that it looked comical. On second viewing, the ball didn't bounce much at all but batsman wasn't looking at the ball in any case. 'Never take your eyes off the ball', they say. batsman c Karthik b bowler 0(1)"
4780,"FOUR, great placement! Nobody in the deep behind square on the off-side and all Iyer had to do was beat the man in the ring. That he does with a fine back foot cut. Too short and wide, got the treatement"
4781,"SIX, absolutely bludgeoned! We have seen quite a bit of these flat-batted strokes tonight and this one from Iyer is another cracker. Shortish and outside off, he makes room a touch on the back foot and smears this over long-off. All the way"
4782,"SIX, chance goes down! Uthappa the man at long-on, don't think he would have managed to stay inside the ropes even if he caught this. Fuller ball and it was lofted down the ground by Iyer. Didn't quite get the elevation on it anc went flat. Luckily for him, just about manages to go for a biggie. Brings up the 50 for Iyer! What a way to start his IPL captaincy stint!"
4783,"SIX, scorching stroke! Iyer is going bonkers here. Expecting the shorter length and makes room before launching it over wide long-off. There was a fielder there but this was wider and higher as well. Back to back biggies for the skipper. He is having a ball on captaincy debut"
4784,"SIX, dropped again! Rana is the man again and he fails to judge this skier well. Ends up tipping it over the ropes at long-on for a biggie. Floated up around middle, Iyer went for the lofted stroke down the ground and this went high up into the night sky before setting towards a confused Rana who ended up putting it down"
4785,"SIX, gets hold of this one! Finally, batsman has middled one and sends this way over long-on for a six. Huge strike! Was backing away to make room and bowler shortened the length to help the Australian's cause. Blasted away over the long-on fence"
4786,"SIX, that's a flat hit! Tells you what one confident stroke can do. batsman is now striking them well. The short ball and he swivels to get inside the line before pulling over short fine leg. Clears the ropes as well"
4787,"FOUR, hammers this! Very full and outside off, batsman holds his shape and lifts it straight over the bowler's head. Dead straight and it rockets to the fence. 11 off the over, a good one but those three dot balls, will they hurt on this seemingly belter of a pitch? Another over left though to make up for it"
4788,"SIX, high in the air....well over the fence! Booming stroke! Mavi isn't hitting the right length, fuller ball outside off and Iyer was already making room for the inside out stroke. Sends this into orbit with that bat swing of his"
4789,"SIX, makes no difference! It won't as well if he continues with this length, Mavi. Fullish attacking the sticks, Iyer just shuffles across a touch and sends this flying over deep mid-wicket for a biggie. Another six that had plenty of height on it. Two towering strikes! Perfect start to the over for DD"
4790,"out Maxwell Run Out!! Sharp from Mavi! Was quick to gather this in his followthrough from Karthik's throw and threw the stumps down at the bowler's end. Maxwell was backing away for the single and was never going to make it back. Slow off cutter outside off, Iyer tried to slog across the line but only got a bottom edge towards Karthik. Maxwell wanted the bye but in the end, had to go. Maxwell run out (Karthik/bowler) 27(18) [4s-1 6s-2]"
4791,"SIX, massacred away! The batsman show continues. Full and in the slot, poor bowling and it's been punished as well. Shoveled away over deep mid-wicket for another huge six"
4792,"FOUR, what a shot! He's been playing breathtaking strokes for fun tonight. Here is another of those. Fullish length and Iyer sits in the crease before and blasts it down the ground towards long-off. No chance for the fielder there"
4793,"FOUR, beautifully played, nicely tossed up on off, batsman gets a big stride forward, gets close to the ball and drives it back past the non-striker, beats mid-off and rolls away to the fence"
4794,"FOUR, streaky but four, tossed up slower and spinning away from outside off, batsman was making room on the inside out drive, doesn't cover for the spin and slices it over backward point, couple of bounces and over the fence"
4795,"FOUR, lovely, how well did Prithvi read this leg break? This was tossed up well outside off and spun away, Prithvi gets a big stride forward, plays with the turn and goes inside out over cover, one bounce and over the ropes"
4796,"FOUR, back-to-back boundaries for Prithvi, bowler dropped this one short and on the leg-stump line, pulled away hard and past square leg, beats the fielder getting across from the deep"
4797,"SIX, ends the innings in style! Take a bow, batsman! Phenomenal stuff! Mavi loses his length (once more) and sprays this outside off on a good length, Iyer sits deep in the crease and flat-bats this merrily over long-off. What a way to finish! DD end on 219/4!"
4798,"FOUR, cracking shot, back of a length and just outside off, Prithvi stands tall, plays with a straight bat and punches, beats point and rolls away to the fence"
4799,"FOUR, clobbered, batsman comes down the track, that allows him to free his arms and deposits it back past the bowler, beat mid-on to his right and races away to the fence"
4800,"FOUR, nicely played! It wasn't a bad ball from bowler, slower and on the off-stump line, batsman made room by backing away, waits on the ball and finds the gap past cover with a blazing drive"
4801,"SIX, lovely from batsman, he's showing why he's the number one T20I batsman in the world. This was tossed up on the stumps, batsman bent down on his knees and swept it high and over deep mid-wicket, deep into the crowd for a maximum"
4802,"FOUR, lovely, full and wide of off, Prithvi needs no second invitation as he threw his hands at that, clears cover-point and races away to the fence"
4803,"out Bowled!! Lovely delivery from Mavi and he gets rid of the dangerous batsman. This was very full and on the stumps, bowled at 143 kmph. Not quite the yorker, but good enough for batsman, he was making room for the slog, gets a bottom-edge and the ball clatters into the base of middle-stump. A send off from the youngster and team get their first wicket. batsman b bowler 33(18) [4s-4 6s-2]"
4804,"FOUR, that's nicely played by Prithvi, let the ball come onto him, used the pace on the ball and then nudged it behind square on the on-side, beat the man in the ring and rolls away to the fence"
4805,"SIX, the helicopter is out, MS will be proud of this shot. Length delivery on the stumps, Prithvi waits on it, then brings his wrists into play and flicks it stylishly over mid-wicket, all the way over the ropes"
4806,"FOUR, wrong lines from Trent bowler, pounds it short and sprays it around the ribcage, Lynn swivels and smacks the pull behind square"
4807,"SIX, that ain't coming back. Woof! What.A.Strike.Sunil.batsman. Doesn't move an inch, keeps himself steady and lifts bowler high into the night sky. Way back over the sightscreen"
4808,"FOUR, no-one's preventing this one. Halftracker outside off stump, batsman transfers his weight onto the back foot and hammers it powerfully wide of extra cover"
4809,"out Bowled!! Wah! Look at beaming smile on Maxi's face. Boy, is he delighted! Lands this on a length and gets the ball to drift back slightly around off, Lynn wasn't fuly committed on the forward push, plays tentatively and inside-edges it back onto his stumps. batsman b bowler 5(6) [4s-1]"
4810,"FOUR, no fooling around this time! Stays back for the slower delivery and then thumps the ball away between mid-wicket and long-on for a four. That was out of the top-drawer from Russell"
4811,"SIX, thwack, thwack, thwack! That ball had wings. Infact Russell lent wings to it. Short delivery, sat up and the batsman thumped the ball away over mid-wicket for a maximum"
4812,"SIX, Russell will go down fighting. Correction - swinging.. That was short, at the body from round the wicket but Russell was ready. Opens his stance, and then muscles the ball over the on-side for a huge six. The second tier stand at deep square leg was peppered"
4813,"SIX, Ho ho! This man. Brute.. That was in the zone, pitched up and the batsman backed away to murder that over long-on. The Russell show has started. Bring on your crash helmets, folks!!"
4814,"FOUR, not all brawn with this man. Stands up and steers the ball over point for a four. That runs away into the fence. The ball was short and outside off, the room was there to send it away"
4815,"FOUR, dances down the track, picks up the googly and hoicks the ball away through mid-wicket and long-on for a four. team will take it, with open arms"
4816,"2 runs, fifty of the partnership comes up as the batsman chopped the cut away to pick up a couple. The man at sweeper cover was a little too square"
4817,"SIX, inside out and it is a mighty one! Flighted well outside off and the batsman gave it more air-time by plundering the ball over covers. DD will start to sweat"
4818,"FOUR, more perspiration on the part of the DD team. Well tossed up delivery and the batsman this time thumps the ball over the bowler's head for a four. That was brutal again"
4819,"out Shubman Gill Run Out!! The young man is gone. The calling between the two had been poor and Shubman Gill to suffer. That was chopped away into the off-side, sans any timing and despite not a great throw and desperate dive, Gill does not make it. The keeper did well to whip the bails off. Shubman Gill run out (Shreyas Iyer/Pant) 37(29) [4s-3 6s-1]"
4820,"out Bowled!! This has been a nightmare. Finally, it ends for batsman. That was a slow googly, the batsman was too early into the pull and misses it. The ball takes its time to tickle the leg-stick. To make matters worse for team, maiden over from Mishy! The three dots also would not have helped the equation for team. DD look set to break their jinx. batsman b bowler 0(3)"
4821,"out Bowled!! The base of the off-pole has been struck hard. Yorkerish delivery and the batsman trying to create room, misses it. bowler gets carried away as well after the wicket. Shouts a mouthful at the batsman. Can't interpret that. But that is GAME.SET.MATCH for DD. First Shaw, then Iyer, now bowler. DD being pulled along by the young guns. batsman b bowler 44(30) [4s-3 6s-4]"
4822,"out Caught by Munro!! The DD boys can do nothing wrong tonight. Slog swept and the man at deep backward square leg jumps up and grabs it with the tip of his fingers. Superb take at the boundary line. That was hit flat and well but the fielder did well to keep his balance at the fence and grab it. In the end, the momentum on the shot almost meant the ball would explode through his fingers but it did not. batsman c Munro b bowler 2(4)"
4823,"FOUR, down leg, swept fine and that will run away to the fence"
4824,"FOUR, does not miss out on the timing despite backing away. Too full and the batsman screamed the drive away through the cover region for a four"
4825,"out Caught by Prithvi Shaw!! Trent bowler is such a good operator with the ball. Does have plenty of variations to nip out wickets at will. Bowls it short and creates that uncomfortable angle for batsman - around middle and off - no room whatsoever. A horrible mistimed shot that, the pull, spoons straight to Prithvi Shaw at mid-wicket. batsman c Prithvi Shaw b bowler 1(2)"
4826,"SIX, pressure? batsman just doesn't know what that means. Sets himself up for a shorter length delivery, clears his front leg and goes tonkkkkkkk straight of long-off"
4827,"SIX, same result! bowler persists with the shorter length, batsman whistles it into the same area with a mighty bat swing"
4828,"FOUR, slogged away off a length ball towards the deep mid-wicket fence but does not matter. DD win this by 55 runs. This has been a superb show from DD, ably led by their new skipper - Shreyas Iyer. Two vital points and team have been jolted badly by this"
4829,"out Caught by Shreyas Iyer!! bowler seems to have come out with a clear plan against batsman which is to bowl short and only short. One swing too many from batsman, not in the best of positions (having cleared the front leg) to flay the ball over the off-side ring; goes for it and lobs it off the toe-end. Iyer calls in early from mid-off, runs forward and grabs it with a slide. batsman c Shreyas Iyer b bowler 26(9) [4s-1 6s-3]"
4830,"FOUR, that ball went searching for the middle of the blade. batsman was in such a good position, everything right about it; reads the length early, punches crisply in the gap behind point with a still head. Take four"
4831,"out Caught&Bowled!! team are falling apart. Another wicket off a short ball. batsman was in no position to play the pull, still goes for it and pays the ultimate price. It came onto him quickly and was cramped for room to play the pull; loops up off the splice and the bowler takes the simplest of catches running forward. batsman c and b bowler 8(7) [4s-1]"
4832,"FOUR, one bounce and over the ropes. Making batting look so simple is batsman. Waits for this length ball to arrive and lifts the punch over mid-off with impeccable timing"
4833,"SIX, short and in his arc. DK swivels a touch and plays the pick-up pull over short fine. All the way for a maximum"
4834,"SIX, time for batsman to show what he's got. Pitched up and right in the swinging zone outside off, Gill marmalizes it over long-off with a clean swing of the willow"
4835,out Caught by Boult!! Plays against the spin and perishes. Looks to go over long-on/mid-wicket with a wild swing and ends up slicing a dolly of a catch to backward point. Half the side back in the hut now. batsman c Boult b bowler 18(18) [6s-1]
4836,"FOUR, tad short and keeps eerily low on middle, but Gill does well to keep his eyes on the ball and slam the pull along the ground through mid-wicket. A diving effort by the fielder at deep mid-wicket goes in vain"
4837,"SIX, smashed. Down the track and to the pitch of the length delivery then lifts it straight back over the bowler. No holding back from batsman and he gets the crowd going"
4838,"FOUR, just wide of Ishan Kishan, but poor bowling from bowler, sliding down and easy for batsman to get inside the line and help the ball with a faint tickle. Does enough to get it past the keeper"
4839,"out Caught by Cutting!! Andre Gomes hangs on. Cutting if you are confused. No power on the slog-sweep by batsman, knelt down to slog it, but found deep mid to a nicety. bowler held back the length a little and got his man. Looked a tired shot to me. batsman c Cutting b bowler 46(35) [4s-2 6s-4]"
4840,"FOUR, wow. Incredible hands by batsman. And almost six. One bounce over the ropes. Full and with mid-off up was asking for trouble. batsman whiplashed it over the fielder. Raw power"
4841,"FOUR, now goes over mid-wicket. Predictably bowler pings it short, batsman is waiting on the back foot. Hammered the pull and there's no-one at deep mid. Takes another boundary. Intelligence and cricket awareness on display"
4842,"FOUR, that's the genius of batsman. He was beaten in flight and had he not reached out low and found bat on ball, would've given Kishan a chance for a stumping, but stretches to his full reach and then carves it over wide long-off, for a one bounce over the ropes four. Incredible"
4843,"SIX, massacred over wide long-on. Again those hands. Down the track and then helicoptered miles into the crowd. The team crowd are sent into pangs of uncontrolled emotion. They are going wild"
4844,"FOUR, fine leg was inside the circle and batsman gets four. Gets inside the line and then waits for the off-pace delivery which is short, pulled well wide of short fine"
4845,"FOUR, and batsman will go wide and over that man. Helped by bowler bowling a low full-toss, on the pads, flicked into the gap and batsman gets to 50"
4846,"out Caught by Lewis!! batsman falls into the trap. There's a deep cover in place for the lofted hit and batsman has found the man. Low full-toss outside off, it looked like batsman was in two minds, whether to go full-blast or not, eventually he chips it to the West Indian on the fence. That is such a massive wicket and team's ploy has worked. batsman c Lewis b bowler 26(21) [4s-3 6s-1]"
4847,"out Caught by Markande!! batsman goes for a golden duck. team are fighting back here. We saw Bravo miscue a few in the last game against team as well, but those fell in no-man's land, this sliced cut lands in Markande's hands at backward point. Beaten for pace as bowler found some extra bounce off a short of length. batsman c Markande b bowler 0(1)"
4848,"SIX, my word. What a blow that is. The weight is on the back foot but he has powered this slower delivery over wide long-on. Looked like he had hit it straight up but it went all the way"
4849,"out Caught by Cutting!! Another slower ball and batsman is gone. Was down the track to hit it over long-on but skewed it off the base of the bat. Easy take for Cutting. The team dugout erupt after that wicket. Turning out to be a top, top last over this. batsman c Cutting b bowler 3(5)"
4850,"FOUR, that has been hit so hard. Rohit at mid-off dove to his right at mid-off, got a hand on that and took the sting out of the shot, but it still raced away to the fence. When batsman saw the pitched up delivery he just plonked his front foot and drilled it"
4851,"SIX, batsman ends in style and takes six. bowler and Rohit are disappointed. This is a fabulous shot. Even though bowler followed him, batsman after making room outside leg, heaved that over wide long-on flat with power to clear the fence. team end on 169"
4852,"FOUR, there's a backward point close in and then a short third man behind him, with no third man in place. Full outside off, batsman lashes a square drive in the air and manages to elude the leaping backward point fielder to his left"
4853,"out Caught by Markande!! batsman goes and credit to bowler for that wicket. Slower and loopier, on off, batsman had to fetch the sweep, can only get a top edge and Markande at square leg almost made a meal of it. Manages to clutch the ball onto his chest and holds on. Important wicket in the powerplay. batsman c Markande b bowler 12(11) [4s-1]"
4854,"SIX, how has batsman got that for six? Unbelievable wrists. Down the track and not to the pitch of this length delivery, but he trusts himself and then whips it in the air, Evin Lewis was the man circling under that at deep mid, but it kept sailing over him and then flies over the fence. Stunning batting by batsman"
4855,"SIX, second ball and batsman takes bowler to the deep mid stands. The trademark batsman slog-sweep, as soon as he saw a bit of flight on that tossed up delivery on off, bent down and clattered it. Nice way to get off the mark"
4856,"FOUR, slower delivery outside off, batsman slashes and gets a thick edge that bisects Ishan Kishan and Krunal at short third. Races away"
4857,"SIX, nothing edgy about this one. Full on off, a clean bat swing from batsman and the white ball soars into the long-off stands. Great end to the powerplay for team and batsman"
4858,"FOUR, short and well outside off, batsman reaches out and cuts, beats backward point and sweeper cover has too much ground to cover. Beats him"
4859,"SIX, bowler ran in hard and then bowled a slower delivery, was right in the lofting zone for batsman who got forward and muscled it over long-on. Six more"
4860,"FOUR, hat-trick of slower balls and so predictable. batsman gets forward and lofts over and wide of mid-off. So easy"
4861,"1 run, finally a seam-up quick delivery, on the pads, stylishly whipped but on the bounce to deep square"
4862,"FOUR, too full and too close to batsman, who just lifts it back over the bowler's head. Hit clean and hard, no chance for long-off or long-on"
4863,"SIX, beautiful shot this. Uses his feet and then goes over long-on after getting to the pitch. Hardik was there at long-on but he was left a spectator by the timing on that blow. The team WAGS are up and celebrating"
4864,"FOUR, too much width and Yadav latches onto it. Bit of away-shape for bowler, but the length is on the shorter side. Too easy for any batsman. Yadav stands tall and slashes it through point. SKY and team get off the mark"
4865,"SIX, carves this googly high and mighty over extra cover. Probably a bit too predictable from the leggie. This is what he was doing against batsman in the entire last over. This time batsman anticipates it, sizes it up and smokes it"
4866,"SIX, my word, what power down the ground. Short from bowler, batsman thwacks it straight back over long-on. It's off the back foot too. Stunning"
4867,"FOUR, spoils a good over by smearing the ball into the wide long-off boundary. To be fair, Bravo was asking for it by bowling this gentle full toss outside off. Duly punished"
4868,"SIX, lofted for six with one hand. How well has he timed this. It appeared that batsman might have been beaten for the lack of pace and was into the loft too early, evidenced by his bottom hand coming off. But mid-off was up, so he had the confidence to go through with it. Ends up getting it right off the middle"
4869,"SIX, wow, what execution! Gets right under this full ball and lap-sweeps it all the way over short fine leg. Just never looks hurried at all. Quickly took a step across, got down low and again, lovely timing"
4870,"FOUR, the Mumbai captain is up for it tonight. He's taking control of this chase now. Short of length ball, only chest high, and batsman dismisses it with an authoritative pull backward of square. Huge cheers. It's a split crowd here"
4871,"out Caught by SN Thakur!! Slices it up a mile in the air, really cool pressure catch from Thakur at long-off. Big wicket for team, straight after the time-out. Good length ball wide of off, gets it out of the batsman's swinging arc. batsman flings his hands at it, slicing it up right off the bottom. Excellent bowling. Bravo coming to the fore again. batsman c SN Thakur b bowler 47(43) [4s-3 6s-2]"
4872,"FOUR, not the best effort from Tahir in the deep, lets the ball sneak through for four. He's immediately removed from that position. Good length ball outside off, batsman doesn't get all of it but does enough to carve it away through sweeper cover's dive"
4873,"SIX, misses his length big time and Pandya laaaaaunches into it. It's a monstrous six over long-on. Probably aimed for the yorker there but ended up bowling right in Pandya's slot. Disappears"
4874,"FOUR, low full toss outside off, batsman ingeniously slices it away over backward point. Shades of the shot Dhoni played the other night, but not quite as good. He just about clears Harbhajan though. Thakur must be crestfallen, this was a perfectly good ball"
4875,"FOUR, that previous ball has messed his line up. This time he goes full at the stumps, batsman shuffles inside the line of it and whips it away to the fine leg boundary. Top batting"
4876,"FOUR, hat-trick of fours. batsman's doing it for Mumbai. Short of length ball outside off, slower one, and the team skipper is able to thread it through backward point and third man. Brilliantly glided"
4877,"FOUR, kills the game off, surely. Tremendous batting from batsman Sharma. He picks the bowler's mind, reads the incoming yorker and sweeps it away through backward square. Raises a fifty"
4878,"FOUR, that spoils the over. Not a bad ball by any means. Banged one short and generated good lift, batsman is late on the pull, off the glove and well wide of MS. Runs away to the fine leg fence"
4879,"FOUR, back-to-back boundaries. Length ball on the stumps, Yadav hops across and flicks it very fine. Bhajji is slightly too square and he can't cut it off"
4880,"FOUR, nicely done! Ample time for Yadav to pick his spot. Normal-paced shortish ball, no venom in it. Yadav slightly crouches and elevates it over short third man"
4881,"FOUR, good placement. Just a bit of width outside off and that's enough for Yadav. Jumps, opens his bat-face at the last moment and forces it through backward point"
4882,"FOUR, width served and Yadav doesn't miss out. Was on the shorter side as well and Yadav used the bowler's pace to good effect. Opened the bat-face to punch it through covers. Excellent placement"
4883,"SIX, wow! That's delicious. The bottom hand power, my goodness. Was a full ball on the pads, Yadav just walked across and flicked it over deep backward square leg. Top shot"
4884,"1 run, fuller in length and attacking the stumps, the bat-face is closed to nudge it towards square leg. Off the inside half. This is a good start for team - 50 in the powerplay!"
4885,"byes, FOUR, through Dhoni and that runs away into the fence. Very rare from MS. It was the googly from bowler and batsman tries another lofted shot. Is nowhere close to the bat and misses. Was marginally outside the tramline as well. Brushed the team skipper's pad and that's four bonus runs for team"
4886,"FOUR, a gift dished out and batsman accepts it with both hands. He needed that. Connects and collects four. A rank full toss fired by bowler and batsman thumps it down the ground. Over the bowler's head and long-off had no chance"
4887,"out Caught by Jadeja!!Gone! There's the breakthrough and is that the opening team were looking for? Game on. What a catch that was from Jaddu. It was a shortish ball and Yadav struck it pretty well. Went back in his crease to pull and got it off middle of the bat. But, in comes Ravindra Jadeja, team's best fielder. Sprinted across to his left from deep mid-wicket, had his eyes on the ball and slided to snaffle with both hands. Bhajji runs towards the fielder to applaud the effort. batsman c Jadeja b bowler 44(34) [4s-5 6s-1]"
4888,"FOUR, nicely done by batsman! This tailed in sharply from a fullish length but the line was a bit too straight. Clipped away sweetly past the diving mid-wicket fielder and it raced away to the fence. team are away"
4889,"out Bowled!! My word. He's brought on as a roller, to sneak an over under the radar, but such is the power that practically anybody in a Hyderabadi jersey can pick wickets. Pathan holds the ball back in his palm as he fires in a slider. Yes it was short, but certainly not for batsman to rock back as deep as he did in trying to heave it away. Misses big time, sneaking under the bat. Well under. And yeah, off's uprooted. batsman b bowler 0(3)"
4890,"FOUR, slipping down. That's the customary loose stuff a part-timer dishes out. Quick sweep, ensuring it goes very fine"
4891,"out Caught by Dhawan!! They're falling. batsman tries forcing the run-rate, but against Rashid, seriously? Gets a floater around off, tries going downtown with a full-blooded swing. Mistimes, and Dhawan's waiting at long-off, with a pre-loaded thigh slap celebration ready to come out. batsman c Dhawan b bowler 10(11)"
4892,"2 runs, full, tailing back in, dug out to long-on -- credit the second to slow timing and the massive outfields"
4893,"SIX, and there. Crunch. Targets the smaller leg-side, premeditates a sweep, slogging it uppishly, deep into mid-wicket. That should simplify things"
4894,"out Caught by Saha!! Wide knuckle ball, angling way across -- tempting batsman to chase, take on the big boundary. Well he has to. Throws his bat out .. he wouldn't have had a problem even with some sort of a big edge. Gets it off the outside, yes, but not past a flying Saha to his left. batsman c Saha b bowler 11(12)"
4895,"FOUR, gets his line wrong. Gets his length wrong. A yorker in the form of a half volley, the line stays on middle and batsman's hoick gets a fat inside edge, through his legs and through a vacant square leg"
4896,"out Caught by Dhawan!! There's the nail. The unlikeliest of ties is out of the equation too. Quite a half volley this, batsman can't get under the length though, drills it uppishly, without elevation. This time Dhawan at long-off need not tumble, he can stay and collect. batsman c Dhawan b bowler 8(5) [4s-1]"
4897,"FOUR, beautifully timed! Placement was spot on too. Got this wide of mid-on and well to the left of the deep mid-wicket fielder as well. A touch short around middle, skids off the deck and batsman whips it away with strong wristwork. Nicely done by the skipper"
4898,"out Bowled!! Bowled 'em! Horror stroke from Tripathi and his woes this season continue. On a good length around middle, kept low as well and Tripathi premeditated the charge down the pitch. In the end, he couldn't do much and had to adjust to keep it out. Couldn't and heard the rattle of timber behind him. Just the start team would have wanted. batsman b bowler 4(5)"
4899,"FOUR, delicious shot! Oozing class! Not all that bad a ball, just a fab stroke. On a good length just outside off, batsman just stood tall and cracked the back foot punch on the up. Through the covers and it blazed away. What a shot!"
4900,"SIX, that's in the stands! batsman is showing no mercy on his State mate. Fractionally short from Thampi and that's all that was needed for the in-form batsman. Swivels to pull this away for a biggie. Didn't get a full chunk of it, didn't have to in the end as it cleared the deep mid-wicket fence with ease"
4901,"FOUR, clobbered away! This time, batsman connected the pull perfectly and it raced away. Short of a length around middle, not high enough to threaten the batsman and an in-form batsman like batsman isn't going to miss out. Sends this to the deep square leg fence. Thampi needs to recover quickly"
4902,"FOUR, such is the form batsman is in, he doesn't need bad balls to score boundaries. Here is another example. A knuckle ball outside off, he just stands tall and uses his supple wrists to drop kick this wide of the long-on fence. The fielder there tried hard but couldn't get to it"
4903,"FOUR, 94.8kph, back of the hand stuff, drifting down leg though and generously full. batsman is quick to pounce on, sits, uses the angle and drills his sweep behind square"
4904,"FOUR, a defensive drag down. batsman stays tall, picks his widely open cow corner. And whips. Splitting the men converging to perfection"
4905,"out Caught by Hales!! Times his way to Hales. He just can't look ugly, and the overdose of timing he's got in him isn't quite on par with the fields put out. Kaul brings out his knuckle ball, with a late tail inwards. batsman tries punching it through the on-side, gets it off the middle too, but can't keep it down. Right where short mid-wicket's waiting. batsman c Hales b bowler 40(30) [4s-3 6s-1]"
4906,"FOUR, gentle loosener from Kulkarni and batsman duly dispatches it to the fence. Short, wide and plenty of width on offer, batsman reaches out by flailing his hands at that and bashes it through point, who's dive goes in vain. Real warm-up delivery from Kulkarni.."
4907,"FOUR, back to shortish length and batsman chooses the mid-wicket region on this occasion. Picked the length extremely early, pivoted back and pulled it firmly in front of square on the leg-side"
4908,"FOUR, third boundary of the over and you got to feel for the bowler. This full ball swung in late, but how well batsman played that. Cleared his front leg in a flash, such quicksilver hands that he flicked it in front of square. The outfield is lighting fast, despite a long chase from the mid-wicket fielder, the ball just about reaches the fence"
4909,"FOUR, half-tracker and batsman dismisses it from his presence. Ruins a good over from bowler. Went back in a flash and clouted it brilliantly in the gap between deep mid-wicket and deep square leg"
4910,"FOUR, batsman takes the adventure route. Walks across his sticks, waits for the ball to arrive and scooped it over short fine leg. Knew the fine leg was inside the ring and hence opted for the shot"
4911,"SIX, Fab stuff. Goes downtown. Moved across a bit, with a clean swing of the bat lifted it nonchalantly over mid-off. Such is the timing that it went sailing all the way for a maximum"
4912,"FOUR, 14 off first three balls. bowler overcompensates and hurls it well outside off. batsman leant across and spanked it with ferocity over extra cover"
4913,"FOUR, oh, he's taking bowler to the cleaners. Streaky this time but batsman won't mind. Throws his bat on this fuller length delivery outside off and gets a thick outside edge that flies away to the third man fence"
4914,"1 run, fifty for batsman. Flawless innings from the team skipper. Bided his time initially and just stepping the ante now. Nudges it towards mid-wicket, puts on the skates and comes back for the second fuss-free"
4915,"SIX, decides to launch Archer over mid-off. Waited in his crease, picked this fuller length delivery early and muscled it over mid-off"
4916,out Caught by Samson!! bowler has another! He's bowled exceptionally well today and has started this spell with a bang as well. batsman was moving around the crease and bowler smartly dragged this wider outside off. Asked the Englishman to fetch it and he could only slice it high in the air. Easiest of catches for Samson at backward point. Decent start to the IPL for batsman but he would have wanted to kick on and make a really big one. Timely strike for team because this partnership was starting to open up. batsman c Samson b bowler 45(39) [4s-4]
4917,out Caught by Buttler!! Huge wicket! Maiden IPL wicket for Sodhi! And it's his NZ skipper that he has sent back. Vital breakthrough for team because the team captain was batting like a dream. This one shot through low shockingly from a good length as batsman tried to play the cut from the crease. It was a great take from Buttler and S.Ravi felt there was a bottom edge. KW didn't and went for the review. The replays didn't show anything to be honest but the snicko has a different story to tell. Tiniest of spikes or murmurs to be precise and batsman had to go. batsman c Buttler b bowler 63(43) [4s-7 6s-2]
4918,"FOUR, nice way to start for batsman! Premeditates the paddle sweep and makes a fair amount of connection on it as well. Deflected it really fine down the leg-side and it raced away to the fence"
4919,"FOUR, up and over! With mid-off in the ring, perhaps not the ideal length from bowler and he pays the price for it. Fuller ball and allows Pandey to get under it. Lifted cleanly over the fielder who did leap but was never going to get to it"
4920,"out Bowled!! Cleans him up! Excellent yorker from Archer and that's the end of batsman. This was on the base of off stump and although the southpaw could see it coming, he was beaten for pace. Ended up just brushing the off bails. Fantastic comeback from team, they are dragging things back in spectacular fashion here. Archer was unlucky not to get Williamson earlier with a yorker and was even unfortunate that a catch was put down as well of the Kiwi. Not this time. batsman b bowler 6(6) [4s-1]"
4921,"out Caught by D Kulkarni!! Double strike from Archer! He turned it on at the death against the Mumbai Indians and is at it here as well. What a boost team have got with his inclusion! Terrific death bowler and this over has been further proof of it. Pacy short ball and although it was a tad wide, Pathan was in no position to play it. Ends up trying to just guide it. Flies straight to the fielder stationed at third man. batsman c D Kulkarni b bowler 2(3)"
4922,"out Caught by Rahane!! team are coming apart here in the death overs. Must say that the team bowlers have been smart as well in reading the surface and executing the plans. bowler does what he does best, a slower ball on a good length that Pandey wants to biff by making room. He has no other choice at this stage, does he? However, doesn't connect it well at all and slices it high towards backward point where the team skipper does the rest. batsman c Rahane b bowler 16(15) [4s-1]"
4923,"FOUR, lovely shot. Mid-off is up and Archer bowls a fuller length to compound things. Easy for batsman though, he holds his shape and drives beautifully. Splits mid-off and extra cover easily to find the fence. Valuable runs"
4924,"out Caught by Stokes!! Archer is having fun here at the death. Gets this third and this is another canny delivery. After a series of fullish balls, he drags back the length and takes all the pace off this one. Rashid was shuffling across for the slog but this got big on him. All he managed was to sky it towards deep mid-wicket. Stokes won't drop those. batsman c Stokes b bowler 1(3)"
4925,"out Bowled!! Bowled 'em. bowler sends batsman packing back to the hut. Very, very poor shot from the southpaw. Totally misjudged the length there. It was rifled quick outside off, the ball was skidding off the pitch. batsman with his knee bent first tried to sweep and then as an afterthought tried to open his bat face to guide it past the solitary slip. But the ball just fizzed off the deck, took his inside edge and deflected back onto the stumps. bowler breaks into a celebratory jig. Just the wicket team wanted, the dangerous batsman back to the hut early. batsman b bowler 6(4) [4s-1]"
4926,"FOUR, Kulkarni has been leaking boundaries. Errs in line again and provides width for batsman, well outside off. KW just reaches across and slaps it square on the off-side"
4927,"FOUR, batsman's special. Classic on-drive. Archer feeds a half-volley on the stumps, batsman just shifted his weight forward, presented a full face of the bat and drove it neatly past mid-on. No need to run for those as it races away to the fence"
4928,"FOUR, rank long hop and batsman won't spare those. Well outside off, batsman rocks back, picks his spot and hammers it to the cow corner fence. Threaded the gap beautifully"
4929,"1 run, has Stokes taken this? Ah, nope. He signals he hasn't taken it. But outstanding effort there from the Englishman. Brownie points should be handed there, of course the fairplay points. Googly from Sodhi, lands it full at the stumps. batsman whacked it hard and flat to deep mid-wicket. Stokes stomped forward, dived and went with both hands only for the ball to bobble out of his hands. batsman' heart would've been in his mouth for a second there"
4930,"FOUR, excellent from batsman. Goes inside-out over extra cover. Saw the flighted delivery early, bent low and lifted it effortlessly over extra cover"
4931,"FOUR, back to back fours for team. bowler ushers a short ball at batsman, no venom and he went back to smoke it in the gap between deep square leg and fine leg. batsman having a move on here"
4932,"SIX, effortless from batsman, back of a length and just outside off, a gentle loosener from Umesh, batsman stands tall and punches it over mid-off, sailed all the way over the ropes for a maximum"
4933,"FOUR, batsman is hurting team once again, short of a length and just outside off, batsman rides the bounce and steers it over short third man, no one in the deep and it's a boundary"
4934,"SIX, batsman's looking ominous. He sizes up this overpitched delivery, gets his front leg out of the way and swings through the line. Clean six into the sightscreen"
4935,"SIX, smashes this into the crowd. 143kph, short of length around the waist, batsman treats it with disdain. He belts it away from his presence. Gee that flew off the bat"
4936,"out Caught by Southee!! The dangerous batsman falls. He's lured into the big shot due to the flight, but gets it right off the toe-end. Had to reach out for the loft, as the line was wide from Ashwin. It's very smartly bowled actually. The ball grips away further to take the bottom of the bat. Southee hangs on at long-on. batsman c Southee b bowler 36(21) [4s-3 6s-3]"
4937,"FOUR, crashes the sweep away behind square. He's doing nothing else, just sweeping. Gets the length he wants and muscles it"
4938,"1 run, sweeps it away to long leg, brings up a fifty"
4939,"FOUR, oh poor finish to the spell from Ashwin. Lands the googly outside leg and is punished. Rana grounds his back knee to sweep it over short fine"
4940,"FOUR, Chahal fails to cut it off. He gave it his best, sprinting across and diving from deep backward point but couldn't get a strong enough hand. But how well has Rana timed this yorker. It's very close to the blockhole if not right in it, but Rana slices it superbly through the off-side"
4941,"out Caught by de Kock!! This is huuuuuuuuge. Golden duck for Russell on his birthday and the Chinnaswamy finds its voice. bowler bends his back as he bangs it in, rushes Russell on the pull and balloons off a top-edge. Well taken by de Kock running back. Massive blow. batsman c de Kock b bowler 0(1)"
4942,"FOUR, full in the slot for batsman who smears it away through extra cover. Excellent finish to the over from the captain. Hammered this drive to the fence"
4943,"FOUR, back-to-back fours. The power of Lynn coming to the fore. Low full toss, not an easy ball to hit but Lynn muscles it straight of long-on"
4944,"FOUR, flurry of runs in the last few balls and suddenly team are bossing this. Short of length delivery, batsman beautifully swivels into the pull and helps it into the gap between deep square and fine leg. His timing's on fire"
4945,"SIX, puts the seal on it. Crushing blow from Dinesh batsman. He's offered a good length ball from bowler, sets himself up and drills it over mid-off. Just over the ropes"
4946,out Caught by Kohli!! Breathtaking catch from Kohli. Phew. It's a mistimed loft from batsman down the ground and it would have landed short for most fielders at long-on. But Kohli races in and then comes up with some stunning acrobatics. batsman c Kohli b bowler 23(10) [4s-2 6s-1]
4947,"FOUR, that's it. 18-year old batsman slaps this short ball to the point boundary and swings his bat in celebration. Back-to-back defeats for team at the Chinnaswamy"
4948,"FOUR, top-edge and four, another lucky boundary for batsman, banged in short and on the stumps, batsman swivelled across on the pull, gets a fat top-edge that lobs over short fine"
4949,"FOUR, just over mid-on, not team's night? Short and at the stumps, batsman backed away on the pull, gets it right off the bottom of the bat, but has enough to clear mid-on for a boundary"
4950,"FOUR, lovely shot, tossed up well outside off, Lynn shuffles across, gets well outside off and sweeps it behind square on the on-side for a boundary"
4951,"1 run, chance and dropped, heads dropped in the team camp. It's Murugan Ashwin who has dropped the sitter. Lovely teasing bowling from bowler, slowed down the pace, this was the leg-break which turned from leg-stump, Lynn was done in by the flight, gets a leading edge towards extra-cover. Ashwin had plenty of time as he ran back from cover, had the ball covered, juggled it twice and shells it"
4952,"FOUR, low full-toss and that has been drilled through cover, Lynn got his bat down like a sledge hammer and thread the ball through the infield"
4953,"SIX, smashed, length ball on the stumps, that was right in the slot for Lynn, he cleared his left leg and hammered it back over the bowler's head, flat and over the ropes"
4954,"FOUR, cracking shot, tad too full and too wide from bowler, Lynn backs away and drills it over cover, one bounce and into the fence"
4955,"FOUR, cracking shot, short and wide of off, Lynn makes room, gets on top of the bounce and clatters it to the right of point, no stopping that"
4956,"out Caught by de Grandhomme at long-off!!.. and bowler strikes with his first ball. This was tossed up nicely outside off, right in batsman's hitting zone, he took up the bait and was looking to cream it back over the bowler's head. The bat turned in his hands at the point of impact, he ended up slicing it high and towards long-off. de Grandhomme completes a fine catch. He had to make sure that he didn't step onto the ropes as he completed the catch - which he did. Relief for team and Chinnaswamy finds its voice back. batsman c de Grandhomme b bowler 27(19) [4s-3 6s-1]"
4957,"SIX, just over CDG, this was tossed up on off, batsman got a big stride forward and lifted it with the turn, high and towards long-on. CDG looked very interested for the catch, went with his outstretched right hand, but only tipped it over the ropes"
4958,"FOUR, that's poor from the fielder at short fine, too straight from bowler, on batsman's pads and he flicked it fine. Beat Ashwin's awkward dive and rolled away to the fence"
4959,"FOUR, beautifully played, overpitched and on batsman's pads, he leans forward, gets close to the ball and then plays the on-drive, beat the two fielders in the deep to a nicety"
4960,"FOUR, this is turning out to be an expensive over from Ashwin, dropped this one short and well outside off, batsman waits on it and then reverse laps it past the lone slip"
4961,"FOUR, third boundary of the over, slower and shorter of off, Lynn bends down low and places it into the vacant gap at deep mid-wicket, split the two men in the deep to perfection"
4962,"FOUR, how slow is Uthappa? My word. Took an age to realise where the ball was going and then gave chase, but can only parry it onto the ropes. Wasn't so well-timed but Uthappa picked it up late from the bat and his sprinting ability left a lot to be desired"
4963,"FOUR, to the left of Uthappa now. No chance for him this time, another sweep, dragged from middle but gets it wide of short fine and it just raced away. batsman gets going"
4964,"out Bowled!! Bowled him. Russell strikes again. Does a little jig to celebrate his second wicket on his birthday. Tailed in late and took the inside edge before cannoning off the back boot onto the stumps. batsman was giving the charge and was late on the shot, the incoming delivery sneaked through. A bit unlucky but that's how it can go in this format. batsman b bowler 0(1)"
4965,"1 run, unbelievable shot from batsman under the circumstances. Dropped by Rana running back from short third. Was a short ball outside off, batsman left the bat llike a periscope and it looped off the toe, Rana was unsure which way to catch and what hand to use, eventually he circled around it and it went down"
4966,"FOUR, my word. What a shot. Half-volley outside off, batsman has dispatched that royally through the covers. No-one moved. But seems to have done some damage to his right-leg after over-stretching on the drive. A limp or two but looks like he will shrug it off"
4967,"FOUR, no problems with the timing there. Picks the slower delivery outside off and then laces the cover-drive on the rise, sheer timing and leaves sweeper cover as a spectator"
4968,"FOUR, for a moment when he sliced that, looked like he had holed out, but perfectly placed between deep cover and long-off. Picked the one that goes away, sliced the loft and it is a one bounce over the ropes four"
4969,"FOUR, beautiful touch. Slower ball outside off, batsman uses the wide gap between backward point and short third to direct the ball there. bowler perhaps gave batsman too much room outside off to play that shot"
4970,"FOUR, short and wide outside off, batsman needs to miss backward point and the sweeper, does so easily, launches it in the air and well wide of both the men, races away"
4971,"SIX, brilliant slog-sweep. Over deep mid. Too full and tossed up outside off, batsman kneels down and finds the biggie that his side needs"
4972,"SIX, fine blow. Two big hits from batsman in this over and both have come when it has been tossed up and in the teeing off range. This time batsman goes straight back over the bowler's head. Good over for team - 15 off it"
4973,"SIX, batsman is pointing his finger at someone. After hitting that for six over long-on. Full and in the slot, batsman unleashes the short-arm jabbed flick that sends the ball over the crowd. We saw MSD do that against Negi in the last game, but this is trademark batsman. How does he get under the ball with such a low backlift and generate so much power is incredibly unbelievable"
4974,"out Caught by Shivam Mavi!! Can batsman clear deep mid? No he can't. Caught right at the edge of the boundary. A slower delivery on off, batsman swings and doesn't get the elevation he needs. Bit more power and it would've been six. batsman c Shivam Mavi b bowler 19(14) [6s-2]"
4975,"2 runs, 50 for batsman and his missus is up there clapping. As are the crowd. batsman doesn't care to celebrate. He is busy getting his breath back. Slugged wide of deep mid to get to 50"
4976,"SIX, now he raises the bat to celebrate. Back of the hand slower delivery from Russell, but too full and batsman gets under this and directs the short-arm jab flat wide of long-on. Brilliant brilliant use of the wrists. That's all one can say"
4977,"SIX, missed the yorker and goes for six. Turns out to be a slower delivery, batsman sits down and slices it over the sweeper, gets enough on it to go all the way. Kohli likes it and roars 'come on'"
4978,"FOUR, that's batsman at his best. Brings the crowd to life. A shimmy down the wicket and then throws his fast hands on the short of length delivery, scythed over extra-cover. Brutal hit"
4979,"SIX, six to end. Shuffles across and inside the line, too predictable, slower delivery again, batsman swings it to the deep backward square leg fence. No-one there and anyway it has the legs to go over the fence. team end with 175"
4980,"SIX, bowler has a wry smile at batsman. Won't help though. Pace on the ball and off the bat as well. Full on middle, batsman makes room and goes over cover, hit well and just about clears the ropes"
4981,"FOUR, a shimmy but stays in the crease and slog-sweeps, to the right of deep mid, in the gap and well placed to get a one bounce over the ropes four"
4982,"FOUR, bit more air, and batsman sweeps hard, beats mid-wicket on the dive to his left and deep square has no chance. Too full and batsman found the middle of the bat"
4983,"SIX, when it is tossed up, batsman will look to play over mid-wicket. That's his signature shot. Sit down and then slog-sweep the spinner. Connects beautifully and loops over deep mid"
4984,"FOUR, horrible umpiring. Really poor. How is that runs? batsman is beaten all ends up by one that squares him up, pitched on middle, turned past the bat and hit the back leg, raced away past DK. bowler went for a slight appeal and then kept quiet. Llong the ump who has given it as runs. Not even close to the bat. team should've reviewed that, but since it was given as runs, they didn't go for it"
4985,"FOUR, short third didn't even move. Nor did backward point. Short and wide outside off, cut right into the gap between the two"
4986,"SIX, muscled. Dragged down by bowler and batsman decides to go over long-on. Pure power from the Kiwi. Biffed that off the back foot and watched the ball go over long-on. 14 to him off bowler in that over and he gets a move on"
4987,"out Caught by Shubman Gill!! Gone first ball after the break. Slower and turns away from the advancing batsman, who still goes through with the inside out hit, can only lift it up in the air for sweeper to run around to his left and take. A fist pump from bowler to celebrate the wicket. batsman c Shubman Gill b bowler 29(27) [4s-3 6s-1]"
4988,"out Caught by Karthik!! Quick short ball and he gets batsman. McCullum actually was intending to send the ball to Banshankari, was through with the pull too early and it took the toe of the bat and looped to DK. No need for the umpire to make any decision on that. Off walks McCullum. batsman c Karthik b bowler 38(28) [4s-4 6s-2]"
4989,"no run, drama that is what kick-starts match number 30. That looked close. The ball nipped in and struck the pads. Bat first is what the third umpire reckoned and batsman survives. That was mighty close. That looked dead but the on-field umpire said it not out and rightly so as there seemed to be a faint inside edge"
4990,"FOUR, full, swinging in, clipped away, four..That sped away off the bat in a jiffy. Little bit of erring in line and put away"
4991,"1 run, doesn't take toll of the Free Hit, batsman. Fuller ball and he wanted to smash hard down the ground. Mistimes it and it flies towards long-off"
4992,"out Caught by Boult!! This time, Faf holes out! He struggled to get going barring a couple of boundaries and finally, perishes in a bid to up the ante. Fuller ball and a bit wide outside off, he tried to go over the man at long-off but didn't middle this at all. Easiest of catches for Boult near the ropes. Finally the partnership is broken and DD will want to drag things back a bit now. Won't be easy though as there is some serious firepower to come for team. batsman c Boult b bowler 33(33) [4s-3 6s-1]"
4993,"out Bowled!! One brings two for DD and this is a massive wicket. The in-form batsman departs second ball. It's a first-ball wicket for bowler as well. Drifts this in just around off, straightens a tad off the deck as batsman went for a wild hoick across the line. Bizarre shot to play very early in the innings but he probably thought that the surface is good to start blasting straight away. Got burnt eventually. Just the kind of momentum DD were looking for. batsman b bowler 1(2)"
4994,"FOUR, connects this time! Clear intent from batsman, walks down the track and makes room to loft it inside out over extra cover. Clean strike and it races to the fence on the bounce"
4995,"FOUR, easy pickings! Full toss and a lot of width outside off as well, batsman doesn't even need these gifts in the kind of form that he is in tonight. Absolutely feasts on it with a slice through backward point. Sweeper had no chance"
4996,"FOUR, more power from batsman! There was a deep cover in place but he was a mere spectator as this blazed to the fence. Fuller ball outside off, juicy enough for batsman to lift it over extra cover. Cracked it away"
4997,"FOUR, freebie from bowler and it's vanished to the fence in no time. Sprayed full and well down leg, batsman just had to beat the man at short fine leg and he does so with a hard sweep. All too easy"
4998,"out Caught by Plunkett at long-off!! Respite for DD! The batsman show is over for the night. But boy, what an innings it was! Pure carnage and ruthlessness from the Australian who certainly was at his vintage best. Cleverly bowled by bowler though, flighted it up invitingly, might have been the googly and the lofted stroke went flat towards long-off. Plunkett won't drop those. This is a good passage of play for the Daredevils. They are quietly chipping away at the wickets. batsman c Plunkett b bowler 78(40) [4s-4 6s-7]"
4999,"SIX, thumped away! Floated googly and fuller outside off, batsman was on the charge and although this was wider in line, he trusted his strong bottom hand to launch. And launch he did, flat over long-off"
5000,"SIX, that's gone all the way! How flat he is sending this into the stands?? Wow! Fractionally short and slower in pace, batsman just swivels and absolutely cracks this pull over deep mid-wicket. He is looking ominous straightaway"
5001,"SIX, kaboooooom! Another one! batsman is on the rampage now. Fuller in length around off, he just stands deep in the crease and belts this over long-on. Comfortably clears the fielder over there. The skipper is infusing momentum back into the innings"
5002,"FOUR, he is playing around with the field here. batsman is on a roll. He is expecting the short ball and swivels to pull this wide of the man at short fine leg. batsman is motoring along here. DD need to somehow stop him"
5003,"FOUR, batsman joins in the fun now and bowler is getting a severe beating here. Misses the yorker anmd gives a low full toss, batsman is already across the stumps and wrists it away powerfully wide of the long-on fielder. Nicely done"
5004,"FOUR, gets it away very fine. Smart batting from batsman but this is equally poor from bowler who is having a horror night. Too straight in line on this short ball, batsman swivels across to get inside the line and pulls it away. Fine leg was too square"
5005,"SIX, that's glorious from batsman! Talk about being in ripe form, this is another example of it. Premeditates the charge down the pitch and lofts it straight over the bowler's head. Dead straight and comfortably over the ropes"
5006,"FOUR, bleeding runs. They have no clue how to bowl to these two at the moment. bowler pulls his length back but the width is there outside off, batsman just slashes hard at it and gets a slice that beats short third man comfortably to his left. Not exactly where he intended but he won't mind"
5007,"1 run, dropped! That's a dolly and Munro has spilled it. Short ball and batsman pulled it aerially to deep mid-wicket. Didn't connect that well but got lucky in the end. Munro probably didn't pace himself well there but no excuses really. How much will this cost DD?"
5008,"SIX, that's deep into the crowd! After a series of good deliveries, Avesh loses his composure. Tries the yorker to be fair to him but it ends up as a juicy full toss. Clubbed away way over deep square leg. 108 meters it is! Second longest one of the tournament"
5009,"SIX, no he cannot! Because he is bowling to someone who is in insane hitting form this season. Misses the yorker and it's a low full toss, batsman just uses his quick hands and it's a short arm jab. Comfortably over deep square leg. No effort at all there"
5010,"FOUR, blasted away! Doesn't matter where you bowl to him when he is in this mood. Banged in short by bowler and batsman was down the track in a flash, flat-batted it powerfully past the Kiwi who did well to get out of the way. Rockets past mid-off who was in the ring. Incredible, simply incredible"
5011,"out Rayudu Run Out!! That's the end of Rayudu, wanted to get on strike as batsman had missed the pull but the team captain remained unmoved. Pant was quick to throw it towards bowler who fired a direct hit at the other end. Rayudu was way short and was never going to make it. Another valuable contribution from him nevertheless. Rayudu run out (Pant/bowler) 41(24) [4s-5 6s-1]"
5012,"FOUR, throws his hands at it and gets a thick edge. The ball flies away to third man and a lazy effort from Avesh Khan at deep third man allows the ball to slip under his hands"
5013,"FOUR, gentle from the giant! That was short from round the wicket and the little bit of room was used well by batsman. Just guided the ball between point and short third man for a four"
5014,"2 runs, very full and outside off, batsman gets under it and smacks it hard to the left of long-off. They race back for the second and it's batsman's third fifty of IPL 2018! What a gala time he is having! team finish on a massive 211/4"
5015,"FOUR, drops it short and that helped the batsman as he was backing away. Drop kicks the ball over the off-side for a four. Much needed for Faf and team. Breaking the shackles moment?"
5016,"SIX, short ball, journey ball! That has gone into the stands. The batsman does not bother to go on the back foot and pulls it off the front foot. That was a bad bad delivery and the deep square leg region was peppered with the sinews working in tandem"
5017,"SIX, pick up off the pads. And the spectators pick it in the stands. Onto the hips as it angled in and the batsman just clipped the ball away with a lot of nonchalance to soar it over deep backward square. Back-to-back sixes for Watto"
5018,"SIX, Faf now rubs more salt into the bleeding wounds of bowler. Shuffles across and shovels the ball away over fine leg for a sixer. Pretty much like the last game here, there is a lot of carry"
5019,"SIX, top-edge! Six! Gosh! Over long-on. That was unbelieveable. The short ball, the batsman seemed to be slightly late on it and the ball flew away over long-on fence. Incredible"
5020,"FOUR, short ball at the body. Again skidded through and the batsman under-edges the ball away fine on the on-side for a four. That looked disconcerting for the batsman but he somehow got bat to it and sent it away. Lucky bargain for batsman. 56 off the PP!!"
5021,"SIX, full ball, buh-bye ball! That has been spanked down the ground over long-off for a maximum! He can hit that blindfold. Overpitched and the batsman just timed it"
5022,"SIX, strays on to the pads and clipped away over fine leg. Fifth six for batsman. This ball is flying off the bat. Bad bowling this from bowler, who has gone for tons of runs already"
5023,"SIX, short ball, the batsman drops down on to one knee and pulls the ball away over fine leg for a sixer. Fifty for batsman! That was a terrible delivery but what hitting from the burly all-rounder"
5024,"SIX, whatta catch! But from one of the spectators. That went miles into the stands over cow corner. Slightly fuller length ball and the batsman knelt down to power the sweep away. Seventh six of the innings for batsman"
5025,"FOUR, Shaw goes aerial and clears mid-off. Didn't time it as he would've liked but just enough to clear the fielder. On a back of a length on off, Shaw used his bottom hand to good effect to chip it over the ring. Couple of bounces and home"
5026,"FOUR, bosh. In the swinging arc for Shaw and he butchers it straight down the ground. Arrests his high backlift, again employs his bottom hand and bashes it straight down the ground. Watch out ump! Nearly knocked him out there"
5027,"out Caught by Jadeja!! Adrenaline rush and Shaw falls. One shot too many for the youngster. Told you, Asif can hoodwink the batsmen with his skiddy short balls, here's the evidence. A short of length that kicks onto Shaw, he looked for a cross-batted smash across the line. Is hurried by the pace and ends up slicing it towards mid-on. Jaddu, the best fielder in the team set-up leaps across, times his jump to perfection and pouches the dolly at mid-off. batsman c Jadeja b bowler 9(5) [4s-2]"
5028,"FOUR, batsman falls as he attempts that pull on the short of length ball but he gets enough bat and finds the gap through deep mid-wicket for a boundary"
5029,"SIX, Gee! Quick hands from batsman, he picks up the length early, reaches the pitch of the ball and deposits in the stands at deep mid-wicket"
5030,"SIX, batsman finally connects one and when he connects it, ball stays hit. A great hit though. Flat-batted slog over the fence. He goes on the knees and strikes it cleanly, ball sails over long-on for a maximum"
5031,"FOUR, poor delivery down the leg-side, batsman puts bat to it and guides it wide of the short fine leg fielder for a four. DD needs more of these shots from batsman"
5032,"SIX, batsman just puts enough power in the shot to send it over the ropes. It was in the fuller length zone, perfect length to hit. batsman goes back in his crease and tonks it over long-on for a six"
5033,"FOUR, sloppy effort from Rayudu at long-off. batsman doesn't get it anywhere near the middle of the bat but he puts power in the shot as he generally does and ball goes for a four. batsman brings up his fifty with that four"
5034,"FOUR, batsman goes slightly to the off-side and sweeps it fine of the stumps, ball goes fine of the short fine leg fielder for a four"
5035,"SIX, fast hands from batsman come into play again. You cannot bowl length ball at this stage and bowler does that exactly, batsman picks it up over square leg for a maximum"
5036,"FOUR, the line is wrong and batsman is single-handedly threatening team here. Slower delivery down the leg-side, can't bowl there with fine leg inside the ring and batsman helps it away on his way over the man at 45"
5037,"FOUR, low full toss and he's mishit this, yet it runs away for four. Long-on was very square and he had no chance of cutting this off"
5038,"FOUR, you are kidding me! What sort of a shot is this? He was almost beaten by the change of pace by this shortish slower ball, slapped it pretty straight towards long-on despite having to fetch this from outside off stump. Dhoni has been having long-on very wide fro batsman and he had no chance. In fact, Dhoni and Bravo were not happy with Faf. Looks like he was standing very wide without instructions and maybe he was just wandering"
5039,"out Caught by Jadeja!! Maiden IPL wicket for bowler and he's been mighty impressive. Ends an excellent innings from batsman. Shortish slower delivery outside off stump, batsman slices it high in the air, Jadeja runs forward from sweeper cover and swallows it. batsman c Jadeja b bowler 79(45) [4s-7 6s-4]"
5040,"SIX, mighty swing of the bat, timing very good, but all too late? Slower delivery on the stumps, Shankar gets down on one knee and lofts it over long-on. Looks like Rayudu isn't happy with bowler for bowling a ball in the slot, earlier he was hinting to the bowling to bowl a bouncer"
5041,"SIX, short ball and smashed. Back-to-back sixes. Why didn't you do this when Pant was going great guns? Would have been of great help. Anyway, this is a pull shot sweetly timed over mid-wicket. Now Rayudu is livid, he wants bowler to nail the yorker"
5042,"SIX, and another one, clean hits, but the intent should have been there earlier for DD to have a real chance. Slower ball again, Shankar muscles this loft over long-on. This knock will do a world of good to batsman's confidence. Meanwhile, MS was shaking his head"
5043,"SIX, now then, now then! He isn't done yet! Raises the fifty and DD can mathematically still do this. 20 needed from 4 balls. Backs away to this shortish ball and pulls over mid-wicket"
5044,"FOUR, Ngidi sought to fox Iyer once again but Iyer outfoxes him. Slipped it wider of off on seeing the batsman back away. Iyer throws his bat, reaches out and slaps it with ferocity, beating the packed off-side field"
5045,"SIX, in the slot and out of the park. bowler getting a taste of his own medicine. Wafted it full just outside off, batsman with a solid base on leg-stump, gets under it and with strong wrists, whacks it into the deep mid stands. Into the crowd"
5046,"FOUR, expertly done by batsman. bowler was getting monotonously predictable with his lines. Full and outside off, batsman walked across his sticks and adjusted it beautifully to lift it over mid-on"
5047,"FOUR, sledge-hammered over point by the Kiwi marauder. Picked Asif's slower ball early, waited and stayed deep to slash it over point"
5048,"FOUR, now the overcorrection from Asif, feeds a tasty half-volley. batsman stayed leg-side of the ball, puts his bottom hand to good effect once again to blast it straight down the ground"
5049,"SIX, Asif getting some pasting from batsman here. 14 runs off the last three balls. The intent was fine but the execution went haywire. Banged it short, no purpose on it and allowed batsman to free his arms. Arched his back slightly and ramped it over the cordon. More off the edge but it went flat and hit the ad cushions on the full. They checked with the third umpire and it was confirmed on the replays"
5050,"out Caught by Karn Sharma!! batsman combusts. Asif raises his hands aloft in joy. The bowler wins the battle and has the last laugh. Second wicket for Asif, nips out both openers. Looked like it was a certain trap, plotted by MSD and Asif. Much like the last ball, ushered it short and this was closer to the body. batsman swung across, only height as it went a long way into the night sky. There was a fielder waiting at deep mid-wicket and he set himself under it to gobble it up. Safe hands from Karn Sharma. batsman c Karn Sharma b bowler 26(16) [4s-3 6s-2]"
5051,"SIX, woah. batsman wasting no time. Gets into the business straightaway. Full on the stumps, batsman gets under it and whiplashes it over cow corner. Into the stands"
5052,"FOUR, bowler is not learning. Shifts his line outside off, batsman knew the third man was inside the ring. Scythed it to his right and it zoomed away into the fence. Smartly done"
5053,"out batsman Run Out!! Kamikaze running and Iyer perishes. Tragedy for DD. Iyer was looking good but a miscommunication leads to his dismissal. Push-driven towards extra cover, there was never a single there. Iyer kept running, Pant took a couple of strides down the pitch before he stopped. The DD skipper was just a handshaking distance away from his partner and no way Iyer was returning. A clean pick and throw from Watto to MS, easy-peasy. batsman run out (Watson/Dhoni) 13(14) [4s-1]"
5054,"FOUR, bowler errs in line and length, batsman makes him pay the penalty. Short, quick and outside off, batsman waited and flayed it through cover. Threads the gap and it races away to the fence"
5055,"out Bowled!! Lock, stock and two smoking barrels. You-miss-I-Hit stuff from bowler. batsman's form seems to be like that mythical creature which just cannot be found. Rifled fast, coming in with the arm. batsman lined up for a heave across the line, fails to counter for the drift. The ball snakes in and clatters the stumps. DD in strife now. batsman b bowler 6(5) [4s-1]"
5056,"SIX, off the mark for six. Again tossed up on leg, batsman this time slog-sweeps and hits it way back over the stands at deep backward square. The crowd getting catching practice"
5057,"FOUR, that's one of his trademark shots. Saw the full middle stump delivery and then went inside out over cover. No chance for Polly at long-off. Gets forward and then gives himself room to get the elevation"
5058,"FOUR, phew! bowler despite getting a boot on that scorching drive, watches the ball run to the fence in a jiffy. Down the track and drilled so so hard"
5059,"FOUR, poor delivery, too much time for batsman on the back foot. Was short and he pummelled the pull between deep square and deep mid. Perfect placement"
5060,"FOUR, and again. This time the slog-sweep. batsman is playing a blinder now. Kneels down and nails this sweep, leaves deep square and deep mid as spectators"
5061,"SIX, no edges this time. Down the track and over deep mid. Didn't get to the pitch but once it is in his range, he decides to deposit the tossed up delivery into the stands"
5062,"1 run, quicker and on leg, turned to deep backward square"
5063,"out batsman Run Out!! Gone. batsman is quick but not as quick as he was in his international playing days. Even then this single may have been tight. Smeared it to mid-off and ran, hoped Hardik would miss but he didn't. End of story. batsman run out (Hardik Pandya) 37(25) [4s-4 6s-2]"
5064,"FOUR, one ball per over he will bowl short. Or else he can't bowl. That's bowler for you. This short ball doesn't rise enough to trouble batsman who rolls his wrists on the swivel-pull and beats deep square to his right"
5065,"SIX, smashed. Over deep mid. Picks the slower delivery and then smears it powerfully over mid-wicket. With all his body weight going into the shot. Sends the team-pro crowd into delights of joy"
5066,"out Caught by Suryakumar Yadav!! Off the base of the bat and caught by Surya at deep mid. batsman is unhappy at himself, screams and then taps the bat onto the helmet in despair. Was a slower delivery and in the slot for the mow over deep mid, but miscued it to the man. batsman c Suryakumar Yadav b bowler 14(10) [4s-1 6s-1]"
5067,"out Caught by Pollard!! The crowd are stunned. A hush of silence and disappointment descends on the Chinnaswamy. Their favorite son of the non-soil is gone. Ok - I made that up. Back to the wicket. This was another cutter on a short of length, trouble was batsman looking to power it over long-on off the front foot. Such a difficult shot that one - even if you are batsman. He holes out to long-on. Polly won't drop that. batsman is shocked to say the least, makes his emotions known before trudging off. That's a difference of at least 20 in my book. Now bowler suddenly is on a hat-trick. batsman c Pollard b bowler 32(26) [4s-2 6s-1]"
5068,out Caught by Rohit!! This is a dream dream over for team. Now batsman goes. No real emotions or celebrations from bowler. He is cool amidst all this. But familiar expressions on the team fans and players's faces. batsman finds deep mid-wicket with a slog off a slower delivery. No power behind the blow. All three batsmen have expertly found the fielder in this over. batsman c Rohit b bowler 1(3)
5069,"out Caught by Cutting!! batsman goes now. Off-pace slower delivery outside off, batsman stands a foot outside off and then slugs this high up in the air, Cutting at deep mid actually misjudged it for an instant or two, but recovers to take it over his head and then tumbles over. Made a simple catch look difficult. batsman c Cutting b bowler 1(2)"
5070,"no run, yorker outside off, batsman fails to get bat on ball. Ishan Kishan fumbles and CdG looks for a quick bye, comically he loses balance and stumbles to get back. Ishan Kishan misses and the Kiwi gets away"
5071,"byes, 1 run, Ishan Kishan with the gloves on misses to hit direct and de Grandhomme gets home. bowler beats Yadav with a slower delivery, a swing and a miss but they steal a bye"
5072,"SIX, that's what he can do. Actually is in tremendous form in the international circuit but hasn't replicated that in this IPL. But mauls this cutter high into the stands at deep mid. Stayed back and gave it his all"
5073,"SIX, and he finishes with a six. This is a tremendous over for team. Watches the slower delivery and carves it high and wide over long-off. Pure power and CdG ends the innings in style. Boy o boy did team need that or what"
5074,"no ball, SIX, wow! What's more it is a no-ball as well. For height. Over the waist. Full-toss gone wrong and he has belted that into the crowd at deep square. That hit brings the ladies on their feet - with one even whistling away to glory"
5075,"FOUR, that's a good shot. But he looks at his bat. Not entirely happy with the connection. Saw the tossed up delivery and charged bowler, to the pitch and lofted wide and over mid-on"
5076,"SIX, too full. So when it is so full, batsman can get under that. No chance for the ball doing anything off the pitch too. batsman gets forward and laces the loft over long-off. Easy"
5077,"FOUR, that's a slog. But he has managed to elude mid-wicket leaping. Dragged the flighted delivery from outside off and even though it came off the thickish inside half, it was enough to beat Rohit"
5078,"SIX, this is the best of the lot. Similar delivery to the last one and now batsman goes over deep cover. Again bowler keeps flighting it and doesn't pull the length back too, hammered in-to-out by batsman. Shows how much talent he has and why Yuvraj Singh was wowing about him when he was in team"
5079,"FOUR, this is a thick edge but it will do for batsman. Backs away and slashes the short of length delivery, gets enough bat on that to clear backward point and short third"
5080,out Caught by Rohit!! Rohit takes the catch and signals to the umpire to check upstairs. He is not sure. Soft signal is out. Good low catch at mid-wicket by Rohit. Slugged by batsman and taken near his bootlaces. Looks like the fingers are under the ball. Let's wait for the third umpire's call. Who is having a look from different angles. Should be given out I guess. OUT it is. bowler strikes and the pressure has told on batsman. He was struggling and has made his way back. Didn't get enough elevation on this hit. batsman c Rohit b bowler 7(13) [4s-1]
5081,"FOUR, no third man. Nor there is short third. Easy shot for batsman. He reverse-swats the length ball turning away from him wide of backward point"
5082,"SIX, fine slog-sweep. Nails it from the meat of the bat. Knelt down and timed it well enough to clear Cutting at deep mid. Who watches the ball sail over"
5083,out Lbw!! Given out lbw. batsman immediately reviews. Has it pitched in line? No under edge on the sweep. UltraEdge throws that up. Umpire's call and batsman is gone. Erasmus the umpire who was happy to oblige that appeal from bowler. Pitched in line with leg stump and straightened just enough to clip leg. batsman was beaten on the sweep and has to make his way out. batsman lbw b bowler 45(31) [4s-2 6s-4]
5084,"1 run, bad call from batsman and Brendon McCullum was gone had Duminy hit from backward point. Dabbed it to the left of the fielder who had already cut off the angle with his movement, Brendon McCullum's bat got stuck in the turf and that didn't help him. Luckily for the Kiwi it didn't hit"
5085,"SIX, the McScoop! Ridiculous batting. Saw him do this to Tait who was bowling at the speed of light in a T20I - if I'm right at Eden Park, New Zealand - when he made a hundred. He just put off Tait that day with some unbelievable shots. This he sets up a good base, takes the full-toss from middle and ramps it over Ishan Kishan's head. All the way too"
5086,"no ball, SIX, my word. What was that from bowler? Must have slipped out of the hand. Above waist-height full-toss as batsman was advancing, it takes the thickish edge and hits the cushion on the full at third man. Only McCullum can play such a shot to a delivery that was threatening to take his head off"
5087,"FOUR, slower delivery outside off, batsman flat-bat thrashes that, didn't hit it really sweetly, but enough to beat long-off running to his left. Looks to be finding his touch. Had to after my earlier comments about him"
5088,"SIX, off the mark for six. Again tossed up on leg, batsman this time slog-sweeps and hits it way back over the stands at deep backward square. The crowd getting catching practice"

The inside edge was found and carried low to the keeper. Buttler went up and the umpire had no hesitation in giving it out. batsman on his part also did not want to review it as he knew he had edged it. The bowler did not appeal straightaway. He only went up after he saw the keeper appealing so confidently. batsman c Buttler b bowler 0(1)"
5121,"FOUR, too full, too fine from Archer and that would run away. First four of the innings. Bad ball and put away with a cheeky touch through fine leg"
5122,"SIX, clubbed away! Such power from batsman, he's made it look so easy but trust me, it wasn't. Fullish ball from Archer and he errs to land it in batsman's arc, merrily swung away over wide long-on with all the nonchalance in the world. Went deep into the crowd"
5123,"FOUR, that's almost gone all the way! batsman lost his balance on this shot, which isn't unusual as we know but this is still outrageous to pull off. Swivels across on the pull and skies it in the air down the leg-side. Too fine though and the fine leg fielder could only watch it land in front of the ropes and brisk away"
5124,"SIX, that's massive! Iyer has absolutely clouted this. Shuffles across the stumps a bit and this is flat from bowler, full as well and disappears over deep mid-wicket. Huge hit"
5125,"FOUR, these two are targeting bowler and this is the big push DD needed. Too short in length and batsman won't miss out on these. Swivels back and nails the pull. Well to the right of deep mid-wicket"
5126,"FOUR, incredible stroke! As if his conventional strokes aren't working enough, batsman brings out the reverse sweep. Connects comfortably to clear short third man. Bleeding runs now"
5127,"SIX, wow, this is unbelievable. It's a top edge but it's gone well over the keeper down the leg-side and into the crowd. Short ball and batsman swivelled to pull it but couldn't quite control it. Eventually, trying to just use the pace helped him and of course, the shorter boundaries here at the Kotla"
5128,"FOUR, this was hit so hard that the ball vanished to the fence in no time. batsman is expecting the wide yorker now and sets himself up for it. Gets a wide low full toss that's absolutely murdered through cover. Sweeper had no chance"
5129,"FOUR, nearly took short extra cover's hand along with it! How hard is batsman hitting the ball! Gee, insane stuff! Half volley with a lot of width and it's absolutely crashed through extra cover. The fielder there got a hand on it and yet, it flew away to the fence. batsman is continuing exactly from where he left off in Pune the other night"
5130,"FOUR, the man at sweeper cover is of no use when batsman hits the ball like this. Can perhaps just help retrieve the ball from the fence. Full and quite wide outside off, batsman bludgeons this through the covers. Nobody moved at all"
5131,"1 run, slower ball and well wide outside off, batsman tries the slog and mistimes it towards long-on, 6th IPL fifty for batsman. He is in serious form here. This is his fastest IPL fifty as well, getting it off 23 balls and going past the 25-ball fifty vs team, Rajkot, 2016"
5132,"SIX, launched well over deep cover! It's raining boundaries here, doesn't matter where they are bowling. batsman is on another level at the moment. Fullish ball outside off, he didn't get the whole of this lofted stroke but still sliced it way over deep cover"
5133,"1 run, slower ball well wide outside off, steered through backward point for a single. 10th IPL fifty for Iyer, almost unnoticed due to the Pant mayhem. It's the fourth for the DD skipper this season and all of them have come in the last five games. Some form!"
5134,"out Caught by R Tripathi!! Finally, a wicket for team! Some respite from the carnage but it's not the man they would have wanted although Iyer also was striking them really well. Slower ball from bowler and the length is a touch shorter, the DD captain wanted to launch down the ground but only got height on this one. Went up to the night sky for ages towards long-off where Tripathi held his nerve to settle under it. Another fine knock from the skipper, he's set it up nicely for DD to score a really imposing total. batsman c R Tripathi b bowler 50(35) [4s-3 6s-3]"
5135,"SIX, batsman is now the top run scorer in IPL 2018! What a time he is having! This one wasn't middled well but who cares, it's way over deep mid-wicket for a biggie. Fuller ball well wide outside off, batsman still fetches it to clear the ropes"
5136,"out Caught by Stokes!! Vital, vital breakthrough! Might easily make a difference of about 10-15 runs to the eventual total. The deadly batsman has to depart but not before he has produced another thrill-a-minute epic. Backed away to make room for the big shot but one hand comes off in the process. Didn't get hold of it and skied this high towards long-on where Stokes moved to his left a fair bit to judge the skier perfectly. Two massive wickets in the over for team, just the comeback they were looking for. batsman c Stokes b bowler 69(29) [4s-7 6s-5]"
5137,"SIX, Shankar gets into the act. Short of a length that sits up nicely for him. He backs away a touch and swings over deep mid-wicket"
5138,"FOUR, gets it away very fine. Not exactly where he intended but Shankar will take this. Short of a length outside off, he went hard on the cut and got a big slice that flew away to the third man fence"
5139,"FOUR, poor bowling and Shankar pounces on it. Too straight in line from round the wicket and all that the batsman has to do it get it over short fine leg. Does so with a lofted stroke after a walk across the sticks"
5140,"out Caught by R Tripathi!! Holes out this time! Gee, some seriously high skiers tonight and team are doing well to get under them without spilling. bowler gets his third and not surprisingly, it's with another slower ball. Shankar wanted to up the ante, rightfully so, but could not middle this loft at all. Tripathi at long-off does well to take it with ease. batsman c R Tripathi b bowler 17(6) [4s-2 6s-1]"
5141,"out Lbw!! Needless review from batsman and he has to go. Pinpoint yorker from Archer and the Australian couldn't get his bat down on time. Pinned on the back pad and it rolled towards short fine leg. Umpire Nandan was quick to raise his finger and so was batsman to signal the T. That suggested that perhaps he might have got some bat on it but no, replays clearly show he hadn't and the rest is just a formality. Three Reds on HawkEye. It's started to rain as well!!! Could well be the end of the innings. batsman lbw b bowler 5(5)"
5142,"SIX, pick and drop ala Shaw style. That was a length ball on the pads and the batsman powers the ball off the pads for a six over deep mid-wicket. Just a short arm jab and the ball was wristed away"
5143,"SIX, drops the ball short and batsman is on to it in a jiffy. This tiny little ticking time bomb just shifts his base on the back foot and pulls the ball away over mid-on. That was smacked"
5144,"FOUR, slapped away!! Four between cover and mid-off. Stays leg-side of the ball, the room was there and the batsman lets his hands to whirlwind the ball away. batsman is handing out some pasting to Kulkarni"
5145,"no run, dropped! team and dropped catches of openers has cost them bad! That was a low full toss and the batsman drove it back. Kulkarni juggled it and the ball popped out like a pop-corn. Did Kulkarni get too excited?"
5146,"FOUR, little backing away movement supplemented with fine hands. The ball threads into the gap on the off-side and the ball races away into the cover fence"
5147,"FOUR, full and flat outside off, sliced away in the gap between point and cover point for a four. The room was there and the batsman chased that widish ball to put it away"
5148,"FOUR, length ball, Shaw stays back and punches uppishly off the back foot. Bit of a slice, which is why he isn't in control, and interestingly gets it over the man at mid-on who was running back. Jofra Archer tried to fetch it back but the ball dropped in front of him and spun into the boundary ropes"
5149,"FOUR, check and four! The slower delivery and the batsman just checked his punch to ensure he lent enough power on the shot. The ball raced away to the fence teasing Gowtham, the man at mid-off, till the very end"
5150,"SIX, wow! Just wow! This man is a powerhouse. That was just punched. Maybe a dropkick of a punch drive and the ball just kept on going and going. It easily sailed over the man at long-off. Slightly pulled back length and the batsman had no hesitation in going through with the shot and hitting it through the line"
5151,"SIX, bowled at 116ks that! The quick hands come down on it like a house on fire and explodes the ball over widish long-on. He tried bowling it quick, the batsman got a length to get under it and muscled it away"
5152,"SIX, short ball, same result. This time off the back foot. The batsman waited on this and hammered the pull over cow corner for a maximum. That just went over the ropes"
5153,"SIX, chips down the track and bang over covers for a sixer! Got to the pitch of the ball and then bulldozed it with all his sinews working in tandem. This guy! Phew!"
5154,"out Caught&Bowled!! Soft dismissal. And against the run of play. That turned a bit, stopped as well on the batsman, who on his part had his feet glued to the crease and just tamely pushed it back to the bowler. A smirk on the face of Gopal after he takes the catch. batsman is gutted. batsman c and b bowler 47(25) [4s-4 6s-4]"
5155,"SIX, full, tossed up wide outside off and drop-kicked with all the non-chalance in the world. The long-on area peppered this time. The length allowed the batsman to get under the ball and send it on a journey"
5156,"FOUR, short ball again but slower at 120ks. This time punished. He waited on it and muscled the ball over mid-wicket for a four. He was not over committed into the stroke and that helped him"
5157,"FOUR, sliced away nicely! Iyer has been backing away to the shorter length ball and does it again. This time he gets a fair chunk of the outer half and flies well wide of the third man fielder to his right"
5158,"FOUR, batsman fails to reach the pitch of the ball, but his bat was gun-barrel straight and he lofts it straight down the ground for a boundary"
5159,"SIX, follows it with a maximum. He shuffles across to the off-side and slog-sweeps it over the deep square leg for a six. Clean striking from the England batsmam"
5160,"FOUR, batsman likes pace on the ball. It was a fuller length ball outside off, Short drives it handsomely wide of the mid-off fielder for a four"
5161,"FOUR, cross seam delivery at the body of Tripathi who gets in a fine position and pulls it through fine leg for a four"
5162,"no run, Tripathi misses the ball again and it strikes him on the pads, DD go for a LBW review. Actually it was a win-win review for DD, or so Iyer thought. bowler had taken the return catch, which meant that even an inside edge and Tripathi was out. DRS shows the the ball missed the bat and was going down the leg-side clearly, so DD lose their review too"
5163,"FOUR, slower ball banged in short, batsman gets it off the outside half, slicing the ball fine of the short third man fielder for a four"
5164,"SIX, back of a length slower ball, batsman picks it off the hand, he waited and waited for the ball to arrive, gets himself in a decent position and tonks it over deep mid-wicket for a six"
5165,"out batsman Run Out!! bowler calmly takes off the bails at the non striker's end and Tripathi will have to depart. This match is going Delhi's way now. Coming back to the ball, it was a perfect yorker outside off, Tripathi swings and misses; the ball goes to the keeper who balloons it to the bowler and he does the rest. Some headless running distilled in panic to be honest. Non-striker almost at the other end by the time Tripathi realizes that he has to run -- basically bullied into it -- and pays the price for it. batsman run out (Pant/bowler) 9(8) [4s-1]"
5166,"FOUR, It is a four, and it's been dropped in the deep by the captain, can you believe it! Crazy scenes here at the Kotla. This is going down to the last ball, it was on a fuller length and at the stumps, batsman flaunts his hitting prowess and hits the ball over long-on, timing wasn't great and Iyer at long-on spills it. Right through his hands there. Couldn't close the palms, the ball rips through it and bounces once before tagging the boundary ropes. Maxwell is around too, standing close-in and watching everything. Tries to slap the rebound off the ground into the playing area but fails to get a hand. Four! Six needed off the last ball!"
5167,"no run, Short has been given out but he has taken the review instantly. Short is spot on as ball has hit his hip, and not the bat as he swatted into a pull. Umpire will change his decision. It was a short of length delivery, batsman was beaten by the pace and ball defeats him and goes to the keeper."
5168,"SIX, batsman has deposited it into the stands. It was a fuller length ball and batsman lofts it with a straight bat over the bowler's head for a sixer"
5169,"SIX, batsman shuffles to the off-side slightly and scoops this fuller length ball over short fine leg for a maximum. Second six of the over"
5170,"SIX, batsman was deep in his crease and he gets himself in a good position and slogs it over deep mid-wicket for another maximum. batsman is on fire here"
5171,"FOUR, bowler is under pressure and he bowls a poor delivery, ball was outside off, batsman makes full use of the room and scythes it through backward point for a boundary"
5172,"SIX, it was the slower ball outside off, batsman picks it off the hand and dispatches it over extra cover for a maximum"
5173,"FOUR, Pant was flying in air like David De Gea, he gets a hand on it but fails to grab the catch. It was short of length delivery down the leg-side, batsman gets some bat to it on the pull and ball goes just wide and to the left of the keeper for a four"
5174,"SIX, fifty off just 18 balls -- the fastest ever by a team batsman in IPL. This has been a ripper of an innings. It was a full toss and batsman takes out the reverse sweeps and sends it into the crowd - behind square on the off-side. Second IPL fifty for batsman this, after 77 for team vs team in Indore in 2017"
5175,"FOUR, young man is under pressure. It was another full toss and batsman with this form is not going to miss out. He connects well and places it well through fine leg for a single"
5176,"SIX, it was raining 30 minutes back at Kotla and it's raining sixes now. batsman shuffles in the crease a bit to disturb the length of the bowler, his base was stable and more importantly his connection was clean. Ball has gone into the stands over deep mid-wicket for a maximum"
5177,"out Stumped!! bowlerji will be a popular man at the Kotla now. It was a terrific delivery from him, he brings his experience to the fore and drags his length back. batsman, on the charge, was nowhere close to the pitch of this widish leg break and he misses it totally, running past it in his shimmy. Pant behind the stumps takes off the bails, delaying it stylishly because batsman was so far down the track, and thus a blistering innings from batsman comes to an end. He came in like thunder and went back like lighting. batsman st Pant b bowler 67(26) [4s-4 6s-7]"
5178,"SIX, batsman finally connects one. This was long due from his bat. It was on a good length and on the pads, batsman moves slightly to the leg-side and powers it over deep mid-wicket for a six. Rajasthan need more of these from his blade, if they have to travel to Jaipur with 2 points"
5179,"out Caught by Munro!! This ball went into the stratosphere, thankfully it came down and Munro takes a really good catch at cow corner. Again a change in pace from bowler, it has become a stock ball for the pacers these days in this format. batsman's timing was dismal, he lofts it in the air and was cleanly caught by the Kiwi opener in the deep. Swirled under it and then positioned himself under the trajectory with a last-minute adjustment. Chest bump with Maxwell and all follow. batsman c Munro b bowler 3(5)"
5180,"FOUR, intention was to hit it over deep mid-wicket into the stands, gets an inside edge and ends up hitting it wide of the short fine leg fielder for a four"
5181,"out Caught by Vijay Shankar!! Poor IPL for batsman continues. He has been in filthy form this season. It was a full toss, batsman mistimes the heave and he has been caught at deep mid-wicket. He is going nowhere and is standing in his crease even after the catch is taken. He thinks it's a no-ball for being above the waist. The umpires have gone upstairs to check for the no-ball. The replay however shows it is below the waist height and batsman will have to depart. batsman c Vijay Shankar b bowler 1(2)"
5182,"SIX, picks up the short length quickly, gets in a good position and deposits it over deep square leg for a six"
5183,"SIX, this has been a dismal bowling change from Iyer. It was touch fuller, batsman uses his power and timing after using feet and sends the ball into the crowd again. Over the head of the bowler"
5184,"SIX, quicker delivery outside off, batsman was deep in the crease, connection was terrific and ball sails into the crowd. Bludgeoned over long-off"
5185,"out Caught by Avesh Khan!! bowler will have the last laugh in the battle of the Australians. batsman loses his shape, he wanted to slog across the line, gets an outside edge and ball scoops up in the air to Avesh, who takes a fine catch at short third man. batsman c Avesh Khan b bowler 44(25) [4s-2 6s-4]"
5186,"FOUR, oh, gosh. How did batsman manage to get this wide of mid-off. Lost timing totally as he went chasing for a drive to an outswinger slanted outside off. Way too early into the shot and canned it off the inner half, evades mid-off who refuses it put in a dive. All the way and batsman is off the mark with a boundary"
5187,"FOUR, edged and past the lone slip. Goodish length, moving away outside off. batsman threw his bat hard at it, ends up feathering a thick outside edge which flew past Uthappa at widish first slip. The third man had no chance as it sped away to the fence in a hurry"
5188,"FOUR, poor poor effort from Uthappa. What an error from the vice captain of team. Flat and quick outside off, batsman punches it from the crease towards Uthappa at cover-point, who clumsily lets it through. bowler is not happy with the effort"
5189,"FOUR, tossed up teasingly outside off and batsman says thank you very much. Leans across, picks it up and lifts it disdainfully over mid-off. Clean swing of the bat!"
5190,"SIX, batsman flexes his muscles and tonks one straight over Kuldeep's head for a maximum. Thrown well outside off, batsman fetches it from there after bending low and slammed it beautifully straight down the ground. Ruins a good over from Kuldeep"
5191,"out Caught by Shivam Mavi!! batsman couldn't have picked the fielder out any better. He knows, can't believe his luck. Punches his bat in anger. bowler provides the breakthrough for team. Landed short and asked batsman to go for it. Watto rocked back and smoked it flat, forgets there is a fielder set for the trap. Hits it straight to Mavi, who takes it at the edge of the bounce. Didn't have to move an inch. Like Faf, Watto also fails to convert his start into a big-score. batsman c Shivam Mavi b bowler 36(25) [4s-4 6s-2]"
5192,"FOUR, brilliant placement from batsman. Safe bet against bowler. Tossed up on middle and leg, batsman sank low and gets under it to sweep it in the gap between deep square leg and deep mid-wicket"
5193,"out Caught by Johnson!! In the air and taken at long-on. Two wickets in two overs for team, they are plotting a turnaround here. Both set batsmen dismissed. Well-flighted delivery outside off, batsman grounds his knee and smacked it - skews it off the toe-end - finds long-on. It was in the slot but batsman couldn't connect it well. batsman c Johnson b bowler 31(26) [4s-4]"
5194,"FOUR, edged and profitable result for batsman. bowler wears a wry smile on his face. Slanted across outside off, lured batsman into playing a false shot. Gets the outside edge and unfortunately for bowler, it flew past a diving DK to his right"
5195,"FOUR, poor line by bowler. Can't bowl such freebies to a batsman in such fine form. Down the leg side and batsman sweeps it away to the fine leg fence. Fielder is nowhere close to cut this down"
5196,"out Bowled!! bowler is bowling a fine spell today. Gets the dangerous batsman, the highest run getter of team with this peach of a delivery. It's the offie that does the trick. batsman waited for it and tried to run it down but the ball spins in sharply, flicks his pads and takes down the sticks. Second scalp of the match for Sunil bowler and the crowd at Eden erupts in joy. batsman b bowler 21(17) [4s-3]"
5197,"SIX, too many short deliveries and MS puts one into the stands. Was getting too predictable there. Shortish in length around off, batsman picks it up early and deposits a flat six over the mid-wicket fence. Sweet sound on that blow"
5198,"SIX, that's a flat six again. Short of a length on leg, batsman swivels quickly and pulls it to perfection over the square leg boundary. That went to the fence at the speed of light, none of the fielders had any time to even react"
5199,"SIX, that's high. That's handsome. On a length on middle and leg, batsman stays put and towers this over long-on for six more. Rinku Singh at the fence was just a mere spectator. The crowd is loving this, when MS is in such form everybody does!"
5200,"SIX, dropped! How costly will that dropped catch prove to be? Was a shortish delivery around off, batsman pulled it hard to deep square leg where Gill lets it through his palms. Tried to reverse cup it and made a mess of it"
5201,"FOUR, 50-run stand up with that blow. Was the googly around off, batsman walked down the wicket and slammed it right past the bowler and the umpire who had to take evasive action"
5202,"byes, FOUR, team will take that! Doesn't matter how they come. Was a quicker delivery around off, batsman tried to slog it away but couldn't connect and Karthik failed to grab it too. That raced away to the fence in no time, so quick that was"
5203,"out Caught by Karthik!! Top-edge and DK takes it. Was short and quick around off, batsman tried to pull it but all he could manage is a top edge. DK sprinted back, called for it and took it. batsman c Karthik b bowler 13(12) [4s-1]"
5204,"FOUR, ah, time for French cricket from batsman. Late swing for Mavi again, batsman squirts an inside edge that almost shaved the leg-stump. Fine leg was inside the circle and it escapes away to the fence"
5205,"FOUR, batsman finishes off in style, with a boundary. Picks the length early on the short one, rocks back and pulls it right into the gap at deep mid-wicket. No fielder there as team end on a competetive score"
5206,"FOUR, no half measures from batsman on this occasion. Spots the half-tracker early, chooses his spot and muscles it to the right of deep mid-wicket fielder. One-bounce four"
5207,"FOUR, oh goodness! What a strike from batsman. bowler and the umpire had to take evasive action as it was struck so hard. Can you believe it? Still runs away to the fence. Full and on off, batsman stomps forward and hammers it back at bowler, who puts up his left hand to take cover. The ball hits him and flies away past a ducking umpire Abhijit Deshmukh to the boundary. That must've hurt and it's his bowling arm"
5208,"SIX, batsman is looking in fine touch. Sees a short ball, backs away and gets under it to smoke it over deep backward square leg stands. Into the crowd"
5209,"SIX, proper pasting for bowler in this over. 19 runs off it and just the momentum team were looking for. Went short, no real threat behind it. batsman swivels across, taking his eyes off the ball and pulls it over short fine leg. Sweet timing and it flies all the way for a maximum"
5210,"out Bowled!! Cleaned up. batsman is hoodwinked by bowler's googly. He was strugging to pick earlier as well. Credit to DK for bringing back the leggie. team draw first blood. It was dropped a tad shorter - the googly - batsman stayed back, waiting for the leggie perhaps. The ball spun back in, goes through the bat-pad gate and crashes the stumps. The South African skipper is absolutely clueless. Eden Gardens roars. batsman b bowler 27(15) [4s-4 6s-1]"
5211,"FOUR, batsman takes on his former statemate. Stretches across outside off, gets under this flighted delivery and lofts it over cover. Excellent execution!"
5212,"FOUR, bowler errs in line and batsman makes him pay. Half-tracker down leg, batsman will keep putting this away to the fence, seven days a week and twenty four hours a day. Half-swivels and helps it away past short fine leg"
5213,"no run, was there a nick? There was a certain deviation and also, a faint noise. I guess, the reaction of bowler suggests that there was an edge. So, will go down as a drop. Guess, who's the culprit? It's the skipper, DK. Googly, turning away from batsman, who went for the drive. Scraps the outside edge, straight in and out of DK's gloves. Costly drop? Surely"
5214,"FOUR, Russell loses radar and spills it down leg. Easy-peasy for batsman, just needed to get some bat on it. Does so and hacks it very fine"
5215,"FOUR, woah. How cleverly did batsman place that? Deft hands. Played it so late, just used Russell's pace, waited deep and glided it to the third man fence. Wonderful from batsman!"
5216,"FOUR, very smart from batsman. Knew there was no fine leg; plants his front leg across and rolls his wrists on the sweep. Sends it very fine and earns himself a boundary"
5217,"SIX, into the stands and the crowd are on their feet. Picks the length early on this short one and swivels quickly to pull that over square leg. Was on to his pull in a flash on that occasion"
5218,"SIX, back-to-back sixes for Lynn. This was a full length delivery on middle, Lynn stayed rooted and timed his loft right over the bowler. Straight as an arrow and over the boundary ropes"
5219,"out Caught by Watson!! Was a short of a length delivery on middle and leg, Lynn went for a pull and got an inside edge before the ball clipped his pads and carried to Watson in the slip. The on field umpire couldn't pick that up in the background noise but UltraEdge comes to Ngidi's rescue. Lynn is back to the hut and all of a sudden there are team, team chants at the ground. batsman c Watson b bowler 12(6) [6s-2]"
5220,"SIX, that's the first one by batsman tonight. Was a shortish delivery around off and batsman cleared his front leg to club it nonchalantly over long-on"
5221,"no run, dropped! Can you believe it? team's best fielder has put one down. batsman slapped the shortish delivery to mid-off where Jadeja spills it out. He tried to take it on the second attempt too, but failed even then"
5222,out Bowled!! Gone! bowler Singh likes it. The quick delivery does the trick. Fired full and on the stumps. Rinku moves leg-side and swings his bat hard; misses completely. He attempted the big heave. Crashes into middle and leg. batsman b bowler 16(18) [4s-2]
5223,"FOUR, good shot to get off the mark. Hint of width on this short of length and that's enough for batsman. He is quick to trek back and employ the cut shot behind square. Finds the gap and fetches his first boundary"
5224,"FOUR, top shot! Bravo overpitches with mid-off inside the circle. Gill stays leg-side of the ball and thumps it over wide mid-off. One bounce and into the fence"
5225,"FOUR, moves leg-side evn before the ball is delivered does batsman and that would have distracted the bowler. bowler fires one well down the leg-side and that's easy pickings for the skipper. Stays low and sweeps wide of the man at 45"
5226,"SIX, that's a stunning shot! That's gone a long way back. His highest score in IPL. Picked the length (short) early, got into a good position on the back foot and muscled the pull over deep square leg. Right off the meat of the bat. Picked it up beautifully"
5227,"SIX, excellent effort from Rayudu, gets a hand on it, but can only parry it over the cushions. Short ball on off, quick hands from Gill who upper-cuts it behind square. Rayudu sprints across to his right from third man and flew with his right hand out to pluck, in vain"
5228,"SIX, 21 off the over and the asking rate has come down to 7.4. team are surely the favourites now. The inexperienced Asif bangs one short, but slightly errs in line. Leg-stumpish and batsman takes heavy toll of it. Walks across and helps it along its way with a hook over fine leg"
5229,"2 runs, maiden IPL fifty for batsman! His team-mates give him a standing ovation. He's played a beautiful innings. Gets to the milestone by driving a fullish ball wide of long-off"
5230,"FOUR, that's delicious. More air on this ball from bowler, Gill reaches out with a stride and gets to the pitch of the ball. Follows it up with a superb drive through extra cover"
5231,"FOUR, now DK tries the reverse sweep and manages to get some bat on it. Off the inside part, misses the batsman's pad and beats the short third man fielder too. The asking rate is below 6"
5232,"FOUR, all too easy. Ngidi doles out a short ball down leg and batsman just helps it on its way. Pulled away to fine leg for another boundary"
5233,"FOUR, bowls a low full toss on the pads from round the wicket. A hit-me delivery. Flicked away very fine. Watson doesn't bother to put a dive. Why would you do that, when you already know the result"
5234,"FOUR, batsman is just toying with the bowler. Well, Bravo hasn't been on target as well. Full toss on the pads, batsman walks forward and flicks it over the square leg umpire's head"
5235,"FOUR, batsman hits the winning runs. Slower ball wide of off, batsman throws his bat at it and slices it wide of backward point, who put in the dive. Runs away to the fence and that's it. team win by 6 wickets!"
5236,"no run, second dropped catch! This is unbelievable really. Is this batsman's night? Went hard at a shortish delivery and miscued it to Jadeja at mid-off. He jumped in order to take it but failed yet again. But you know batsman, he'll give you more chances"
5237,"FOUR, edged away! Full length delivery around middle and leg, batsman takes on the bowler, swings hard and gets an outside edge that flies over the slip cordon to find the fence. Every boundary batsman hits from here on will hurt Jadeja"
5238,"FOUR, pulled away! He'll continue playing the same way, doesn't matter. Short length around around off, batsman clears his front leg again and pulls it over mid-wicket, beats the man in the deep with ease"
5239,"FOUR, how quick is this outfield! Or is the timing by batsman? Fullish on the pads and batsman nicely flicks it through mid-wicket. Beats short mid-wicket and deep mid-wicket with his perfect timing on this flick"
5240,"FOUR, another edge, another boundary! Was a full length delivery angled away from the batsman, batsman went hard at it, swung at it and got a thick outside edge that flew over gully this time. Hit out or get out, this is the only one way batsman knows"
5241,"out Caught by Dwayne Bravo!! The skiddy pace of Asif gets batsman. Was a short and quick delivery around off, batsman went ahead with his pull and got a top edge to mid-on. DJ Bravo won't miss those as he settles underneath and reverse cups it. Two of team's finest batsmen are back to the hut. batsman c Dwayne Bravo b bowler 6(8) [4s-1]"
5242,"FOUR, Harbhajan Singh misfields! This is contagious. First Jadeja, now Bhajji. MS Dhoni would be livid with this. Was a full length delivery outside off, batsman went for a drive and got an outside edge towards third man where a misfield helped him with a boundary. batsman will be thanking team fielders for their generosity tonight"
5243,"FOUR, how well has Gill played that? This was a short delivery and dipping into him. Gill adjusts well and pulls it nicely, beats deep square leg by some distance and gets off the mark"
5244,"FOUR, that's called improvisation. Picks the length early again, goes back in his crease and guides this towards the third man fence. Opened the face of the bat real late and got a cheeky boundary"
5245,"FOUR, that was in the air, but in the gap too. Ends the powerplay with a boundary, does Gill. Was short and wide outside off and Gill placed his square cut right into the gap between point and cover-point. End of a fruitful powerplay for team"
5246,"SIX, batsman won't hang around blocking. Definitely not against a left-arm spinner. Was bulleted on off, batsman stood tall and smoked it over cow corner. Swung hard"
5247,"out Caught by Dwayne Bravo!! Dropped him twice, conceded a six and finally bowler removes batsman. Much-needed breakthrough. The West Indian perishes trying to deposit another one into the stands. The length was on the shorter side and batsman was a touch early to swing his bat. He wanted to go over deep mid-wicket, ended up lofting it to long-on. Bravo won't drop those. Yet another important knock from batsman. He's done his job. batsman c Dwayne Bravo b bowler 32(20) [4s-4 6s-2]"
5248,"FOUR, what a way to greet a new bowler. Looped up delivery, but in the process overpitched, Rinku presses forward and chipped it inside-out over extra cover. Top shot"
5249,"FOUR, nicely done! Risky, but executed it so well. With a slip in place, Rinku employs the late-dab. Played very late and got it wide of the slip fielder. No third man to stop that"
5250,"FOUR, that's an incredible shot. Was a full ball and Gill doesn't get down to sweep. Can't call it as sweep. A half-sweep, half-whip. Powerfully hit through square leg. Raced away"
5251,"SIX, lovely, batsman has been in sensational form this IPL and this was a gift from bowler, full and wide of off, lets batsman free his arms and lift it high and over cover, into the first tier of the stands"
5252,"SIX, cracking shot, this is an exhibition from KL, a gentle loosener from bowler, full and well outside off, batsman leans forward, presents the full face of the bat, high elbow and the ball sails into the first tier of the stands at cover"
5253,"FOUR, similar delivery but the field is slightly tinkered to batsman. Sweeper cover was brought in and extra cover was moved back. batsman knew it, so went deep and flashed it in the pocket between cover and backward point"
5254,"1 run, 24th IPL fifty for batsman, ""He's having a prime time"" says Sanjay Manjrekar on air. And there comes the 'Baby in the arms' celebration. Kings XI Punjab owner Preity Zinta is up on her feet applauding. bowler begins with a cutter on leg, turned gently to short fine leg to bring up the landmark"
5255,"out Caught by Suryakumar Yadav!! bowler's gotten rid of batsman in his first over. Prized scalp this for the Australian. Seemed like the off-paced delivery once again. batsman picked it and went back to mow it over deep mid-wicket. In the process, loses his shape completely and skies it as far as SKY, who settles under it. Throws the ball up in the air, that says a lot of how desperate they were to see the back of Universe Boss. batsman c Suryakumar Yadav b bowler 50(40) [4s-6 6s-2]"
5256,"SIX, vintage Yuvi! Greets Krunal to the crease with a maximum. Floated up in the swinging arc for him, batsman gets under it and smokes it into the deep mid-wicket stands. Too easy"
5257,"out Yuvraj Run Out!! Third umpire called in for a run-out check but Yuvi has already started walking. Oh jeez! Yuvraj is nowhere in the frame. Goner! Unnecessary wicket. There was never a run there, to be honest. ""Crazy running"" was the comment from Haydos on air. There was a mix-up between both batsmen in the last over as well. Dropped in front of point, they set off for a single. Yuvi's bat got stuck in the turf and a flat, neat throw from Lewis to the keeper. Kishan does the rest. Yuvraj run out (Lewis/Ishan Kishan) 14(14) [6s-1]"
5258,"FOUR, some fortune for batsman. Walked across and tried to slog it across the line. Gets a thick top-edge and it flies away to the third man fence. The fielder was inside the ring and had no chance"
5259,"SIX, whack! Too predictable lengths from bowler. The slower ball, tad shorter. batsman picked it up early, employs his strong bottom-hand into play to muscle it over deep mid-wicket, clears the rope for a maximum"
5260,"SIX, batsman decides to have some fun. bowler overdoes the flight here. Feeds it full and in the slot for batsman, who flexes his arms and tonks it a long way into the long-on stands"
5261,"SIX, wowza! batsman sends one into the first tier. Poor delivery from bowler, short without any purpose. batsman moves across his sticks, gets under it and hammers it behind square on the leg-side. Wonderful!"
5262,"no run, direct-hit and Nair would've been on his way back to the hut. Patel gets an inside edge onto his pad, the ball drops into the off-side. bowler rushes forward, collects the ball and sees Nair stuttering at the middle of the pitch. Picks up and rifles a throw at the non-striker's end, but misses the target"
5263,"out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! batsman was iffy with his running right from the start, rode his luck but finally perishes now. Fullish on off, batsman backed away aiming to go inside-out over extra cover. Doesn't get the timing right and ends up hitting it towards Harik at long-off, who had to run to his left and gobbles it up. Made that look so easy, didn't he? Punjab continue to lose wickets in clusters. batsman c Hardik Pandya b bowler 23(12) [4s-1 6s-2]"
5264,"1 run, run-out opportunity missed. An ill-advised single after batsman tucked to straight to short mid-wicket and took off for a single. Was always struggling and a direct-hit at the non-striker's end would've been curtains for batsman"
5265,"out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! bowler has been exceptional today. Deceives Patel with an off-cutter that gripped off the deck. Patel checked his loft, didn't go full throttle and ended up chipping it tamely to Hardik at long-on. Safe as houses! Another one bites the dust. This is superb comeback by team. batsman c Hardik Pandya b bowler 13(12) [6s-1]"
5266,"1 run, kamikaze running from Punjab. Agarwal would've been dismissed for a blob had SKY effected a run-out at the bowler's end. Chopped towards cover, they risk a single and Mayank would've been short by a few inches there, despite him dragging his bat"
5267,"SIX, in the airrr and just clears a leaping Rohit. A handy six for Agarwal and Punjab. Pitched up just outside off, Agarwal went through with the loft with a clean swing of the bat, enough wings on it to take it over the ropes at long-off"
5268,"SIX, ""That's the 500th six of the tournament,"" informs Sanjay Manjrekar on air. Hardik offers a full ball in the slot, batsman sets up a solid base of off and launches it over long-off"
5269,"FOUR, batsman is playing a blinder for Punjab. Sees a short ball, backs away and bludgeons it powerfully wide of long-on. Evades the fielder comfortably"
5270,"out Caught by Krunal Pandya!! Caught by Senior Pandya. Mayank combusts. Had to go for it simply; full and outside off, Agarwal was backing away and had to reach out for it. Threw his bat and lost his shape. Slices it up in the air to short third man. The ball was swirling and Krunal judges it well to hold onto it without much fuss. batsman c Krunal Pandya b bowler 11(7) [6s-1]"
5271,"SIX, awful from Hardik. Cannot bowl short with third man inside the ring. batsman knew the fielder was in, so went back and ramped it over short third man. Such is the timing that it went all the way for a maximum"
5272,"FOUR, wow! This has been a morale-boosting over for Punjab. Banged short, at the stumps. batsman is too strong to miss out. Pulls it witheringly to the cow corner fence"
5273,"FOUR, batsman breaks free and this is his first attacking shot of the night, fraction too full and just outside off, batsman gets his left leg out of the way, brings his bat down and thumps it back past the non-striker, one bounce and over the ropes"
5274,"FOUR, back-to-back boundaries for batsman, fraction too short and wide of off, batsman backs away, gets his left leg out of the way and clatters it to the left of point, no stopping that"
5275,"FOUR, three boundaries off the over and 16 came from it, too short and too wide from Hardik, can't bowl those lengths with third man in the ring, batsman backs away and clears the fielder with the cut, one bounce and over the ropes"
5276,"SIX, massive, batsman has sent this ball into the roof of the Holkar Stadium. Banged in short and at the stumps, batsman backs away, frees his arms and muscles it high and over square leg. This one will not come back, new balls please"
5277,"FOUR, batsman has got going now, predictable delivery from bowler, full and just outside off, batsman gets forward and thumps it over mid-off, one bounce and over the ropes"
5278,"1 run, chance, but it was gone even before bowler could get his hands around, Dropped short and just outside off, batsman stayed back and punched it to the right of the bowler, burst through his hands even before he could react"
5279,"FOUR, nicely played by batsman, too full and on the stumps, batsman gets forward, doesn't bend down completely and plays a half-arm sweep past mid-wicket, bisects the two men in the deep to a nicety"
5280,"out Caught by Duminy!! That's a rank long hop and batsman is gutted as he walks back to the hut. This was the attempted wrong 'un by bowler, dropped it way too short though, might have stuck slightly on the pitch, batsman had to wait that extra second as he pulled, enough to mess up with his timing and he struck it hard, flat and straight to Duminy at deep mid-wicket. batsman c Duminy b bowler 24(20) [4s-1 6s-2]"
5281,"SIX, huge and that's into the top tier of the ground, too full and too wide from bowler, batsman gets underneath the ball and sends it soaring - high and over cover for a maximum"
5282,"FOUR, this is excellent cricket, the wrong 'un from bowler, pitched well outside off and spun away, batsman waited for the ball to do its bit, arched back and carved it over backward point, the fielder gave the chase, but the ball spun away past him and into the fence"
5283,"1 run, edged and dropped, short of a length and just outside off, batsman went hard on the cut, gets a thick edge to the right of the keeper. Ishan Kishan didn't get his foot moving, went one-handed as he dived, the ball hit his palms and bounced out"
5284,"leg byes, FOUR, sloppy from Ishan Kishan once again, low full-toss on batsman's pads, he was looking to flick and missed, went fine and to the right of the keeper. Kishan was late on the dive and lets the ball slip through for four leg-byes"
5285,"SIX, muscled away! Much-needed release stroke for Kishan. He was crawling along and this should help. Fired flat and on a good length, Kishan was down on one knee in a flash and slog swept hard. Flat over deep square leg for a biggie. Nicely struck"
5286,"FOUR, lovely stroke. bowler erred by gifting a low full toss on the pads, Suryakumar with that flourish of his wristed it away through square leg. Rajpoot was stationed well behind square and made a desperate attempt to get to the ball. In vain"
5287,"out Caught by Rahul!! Huge wicket! Massive blow for Mumbai as the well-set Suryakumar has to depart. Have to say that this was a result of the slow scoring by Lewis and Kishan at the other end. Slower ball and the length is dragged back as well, Suryakumar went for the slog but only managed to sky it high in the air. Rahul was quick to call for it and trekked back nicely to sit under it. High pressure catch and it's been taken. Mumbai in a spot of bother here. They need their skipper to take charge. batsman c Rahul b bowler 57(42) [4s-6 6s-3]"
5288,"SIX, helps it away for a biggie! bowler spoils the over with a short ball around leg stump, doesn't rise enough to threaten Kishan who swivels to just control the pull. The emphasis was to just use the pace and get it over short fine leg. In the end, it went all the way"
5289,"FOUR, clubbed wide of long-on. It was in the air but Hardik got his placement right. On a good length from a flat trajectory, he gets under it and flays it away"
5290,"1 run, flatter and outside off, chops the cut towards cover and takes Yuvraj on for the single. The shy at the bowler's end misses but I reckon Hardik may have made it"
5291,"SIX, that's gone deep into the crowd! Best over of the chase thus far and team needed this to be fair. bowler is under pressure now. Full and flat just outside off, Kishan fetches it with a slog sweep over deep mid-wicket. Meaty blow!"
5292,out Bowled!! Excellent comeback from bowler! Got carted for two biggies but the Afghan lad has held his nerve brilliantly. Saw Kishan give the charge and hung it back a bit in the air. Pulled the length back just a touch and that meant that the wild slog was never really on. Kishan misses and finds the stumps in a mess. Back to back overs where the runs have come but so have the wickets and that's what team will be concerned with as team bat deep. batsman b bowler 25(19) [6s-3]
5293,"FOUR, Stoinis lets it through! Poor fielding and his Aussie teammate who is bowling won't be amused at all. Slower and fuller outside off, Hardik absolutely belted the drive but it shopuld have been cut off at sweeper cover. Instead it sneaks through Stoinis and crashes into the fence"
5294,"SIX, dumped into the stands! batsman has been promoted to up the ante and he is at it. Makes a hint of room and gets a fuller ball in his arc, smokes it into orbit at long-on. Powerful hit!"
5295,"out Bowled!! The stumps are in a mess! This is excellent stuff from Tye and this is why he is sought after in the T20 format. Loves bowling at the back end of the innings. This is a big strike for team as the dangerous batsman has to depart. He did get going tonight from the word go but his cameo has been nipped in the bud. The cutter from Tye and he did smartly to attack the stumps, a wild slog attempted and once Hardik missed it, he knew the result. Woodwork destroyed! batsman b bowler 23(13) [4s-2 6s-1]"
5296,"FOUR, good placement and timing to get Krunal off the mark. Finds the fence. Fuller ball on the pads, he shuffled across and flicked this well wide of the deep mid-wicket fielder who had lot of ground to cover"
5297,"SIX, this will help team! The skipper tees off and clears the fence with ease. Fullish and in the slot, flatter trajectory helped batsman as he clubbed it dead straight over the bowler's head. Lovely placement too as you cannot have a fielder there. Not that it would have mattered"
5298,"SIX, what a gigantic strike! batsman is in the mood tonight, that's for sure. Shuffles a tad across the stumps and gets a fuller ball closer his arc. Goes through with that classy bat swing of his to send this way into the crowd at deep mid-wicket. 14 off the over! team are hanging on here"
5299,"FOUR, sublime stroke! Most people would have tried slogging this but not batsman. Uses his timing and placement to find the fence. Full and wide outside off, unfurls the drive with finesse past a diving extra cover fielder. There wasn't any protection in the deep"
5300,"FOUR, an exact replica from Krunal and the runs are coming now. Full and wide outside off, slower ball but the width allows the southpaw to free his arms. Crashes it through extra cover and the man at sweeper is very wide"
5301,"FOUR, raining boundaries now! This is the over team needed to turn this game around and bowler is bearing the brunt of it. Misses the yorker for the second time in as many deliveries and it's a full toss on the pads, easily chipped away aerially but well wide of short fine leg"
5302,"SIX, M-A-S-S-I-V-E! What a blow by Krunal! This over has most certainly sealed the game for Mumbai. Excellent hitting under pressure from these two. bowler errs on the fuller side once more and feeds it right where Krunal was wanting it. He backed away, cleared his front leg and deposited it over long-on for a mammoth six"
5303,"FOUR, not where he wanted to hit this but who cares? team are cantering now. Slower and shortish, foxed Krunal for a moment but the length allowed him to adjust. Lobbed wide of backward point and it races away. Just 11 off 10 needed now!"
5304,"SIX, he has absolutely blasted this away! Krunal is hitting them with such ferocity and also clearing the fence by some margin as well. Fuller ball on middle and leg, he was backing away and slogs it merrily over the ropes. Such a huge hit and with such power. Wow!"
5305,"leg byes, FOUR, Mumbai are alive! They live on to fight another day this season. An anti-climax of a finish, slow yorker and Krunal missed the slog to be hit on the back leg. team were busy appealing for LBW and the ball raced away to the fence. They didn't have any review to challenge the call anyway and so it meant that the game was settled"
5306,"SIX, over Mayank's ambitious one-handed leap at deep square leg! Was pulled away by batsman. Short and at 132ks isn't going to threaten him on this pitch. So he swivels, without bothering to keep the shot down and gets it all the way"
5307,"SIX, that's been picked up like a bestseller on the shelf. Length on the pads and batsman's lovely wrists come into play. Whipped all the way over deep square"
5308,"FOUR, that's been smuggled past Ashwin at mid-on. Slower ball yeah, and batsman clips it safely wide of Ashwin there. Knew the chase, as lethargic as it'll be, will be more for the cameras. And it was.."
5309,"FOUR, so starts with a slower delivery that decks away and ironically allows batsman the room to slap it off the back foot. Through extra cover"
5310,"out Caught by Rahul!! Gets batsman with the back-of-the-hand delivery. But to be honest, that wasn't what defeated the batsman; it was more the drift that was taking the ball away. batsman went for the cut, played out of sync with the lack of pace on the ball, and edged it behind. Sharp catch by KL Rahul, it must be said. batsman c Rahul b bowler 10(13)"
5311,"FOUR, perfect length for batsman. Not too full, not too short, so he could kneel and half-pull half-sweep that through fine leg"
5312,"FOUR, overpitched slower one and that's been burnt down to long-on. Absolutely drilled away with little respect"
5313,"SIX, going...going...going..GONE! That was in the nightsky for an eternity and yet had enough distance to go deep into the crowd. Clean hit! Full and in the slot for Suryakumar who just goes through the line with the loft. Didn't seem like he got hold of it initally but boy, didn't he??"
5314,"FOUR, more runs! Just the momentum team were needing after a lull phase. bowler errs on the shorter side and there is width as well, Suryakumar holds his shape and slaps the cut behind point. Fifty for SKY"
5315,"FOUR, cracking shot! That is not the place to bowl to any batsman. Short, wide and outside off, just the delivery batsman would have liked to get him going, slapped the cut square on the off-side and opened his account in style"
5316,"FOUR, even with a sweeper batsman collects a boundary. bowler is still searching for swing, pitches it up and batsman leans forward to caress the drive through cover. de Grandhomme gave up the chase early"
5317,"SIX, that ruins the over. Tries to scare the debutant with a short delivery, but batsman has made a clean connection with the hook shot, got inside the line and used the pace on the ball to place it over fine leg"
5318,"FOUR, poor ball from bowler, short and angling into batsman's pads, he swivels across, rolls his wrists and pulls it behind square on the on-side for a boundary"
5319,"out Caught by Siraj!! .. and he strikes first ball. It's the big wicket of batsman, dropped short and wide of off, batsman's eyes lit up as he saw the width, went way too hard on the cut, lost his poise and the thick top-edge lobbed gently to Siraj at short third man. Relief for team, but still need 7 wickets to pinch this match. batsman c Siraj b bowler 32(25) [4s-3 6s-2]"
5320,"out Caught by Mandeep!! Short, wide and OUT. Looks like team have found a way of taking wickets, another soft dismissal for team. batsman is the man to go, he saw the width, went with hard hands on the cut, nailed the shot but didn't bother to keep it down. Straight into the bucket like hands of Mandeep at backward point. DO team stand a chance here? batsman c Mandeep b bowler 8(9) [6s-1]"
5321,"no run, chance and Parthiv has shelled it, it was a tough chance, he was standing up to the batsman, on a good length and well wide of off, Bravo went for the flamboyant drive, got a feather and Parthiv grabbed at that, it popped out and he had a second bite at the cherry, but can't hold on"
5322,"1 run, chance and dropped, team simply can't afford this, Kohli looks livid, but Chahal is the man who has dropped it. This was tossed up well outside off, Bravo went for his flamboyant inside out drive, didn't bother to keep it down. Chahal did all the hard yards, ran across to his right from sweeper cover, got to the ball and then shelled it as he tumbled onto the ground"
5323,"SIX, that should relieve the pressure off Bravo, a rank long hop from Ashwin, Bravo rocks back and nails the pull over wide long-on, went a long way over the ropes"
5324,"FOUR, poor ball from Ashwin, drops his length short and well outside off, batsman is all over it like a rash, slaps it past cover and collects his first boundary"
5325,"SIX, massive, that should seal this match. This was the wrong 'un from bowler, batsman spots it early, gets a big stride forward, plays with the turn and smashes it high and over deep mid-wicket"
5326,"SIX, that should be it, this was tossed up well outside off, batsman gets forward and thumps it high towards long-on, didn't get hold of the shot, Kohli at long-off was kept interested, but in the end - the ball sailed over his head"
5327,"SIX, back-to-back sixes for batsman, hitting of the highest order from the former India captain. This was tossed up on off, batsman gets forward and thumps it high and over long-on for a maximum"
5328,"SIX, that is what pace brings. batsman is hardly in control of the pull shot, but the ball has sailed away for a maximum. Rushed the batsman with a short ball and the top-edge flies over the team dugout"
5329,"out Bowled!! The perfect set-up from Umesh. Couple of short of length deliveries before the full one, batsman's feet went nowhere as he tried to get bat on ball, beaten for sheer pace and the ball uproots the off-stump. The direction is what mattered and Umesh got it spot on. Aimed right for the base of off-stump. There's the wicket team were looking for. batsman b bowler 11(14) [4s-2]"
5330,"FOUR, slower delivery and batsman spotted that early, a much needed boundary for team that. Waited for the off-cutter, stood his ground and heaved it over mid-wicket. No chance for AB to pull it back in"
5331,"SIX, wrong length from bowler. The off-cutter is landed short of length, sat up for batsman, who gave it his all to smash the pull over mid-wicket, the in-form batsman has broken the shackles for the home side"
5332,"FOUR, big over for team, 16 off it. Overpitched delivery and right in the slot for batsman, with the form he is, there is no missing out on such freebies, drills the drive wide of mid-off. Did Kohli err in giving bowler a third?"
5333,"SIX, that's the pressure releaser. Needed a boundary or something to get himself going. Backed away to leg and got the length delivery right in his arc, swung it away over long-on. Not quite off the middle but still had enough"
5334,"2 runs, run-out chance missed. This is where team will miss de Kock. He has been brilliant behind the stumps. Very full and outside off, batsman squeezes out to square third man, Ashwin gets across and releases the ball quickly, Parthiv failed to gather the ball. Had he done so, then batsman was gone"
5335,"FOUR, poor delivery from bowler. Rank long hop and batsman had all the time in world to pick his spot, transfers his weight on the back foot and slots the pull past square leg, no chance for the man in the deep"
5336,"FOUR, easy! That is well played by batsman. Short of length delivery, batsman shuffled across to get inside the line, picked it up from the middle stump line and tickled it fine. Runs starting to flow quite comfortably now"
5337,"out Caught by Southee!! batsman is waiting. He has been asked to walk back. Fine take by Southee. With a leg slip in place, batsman had to find other areas to play the short ball, so he moves away to leg and tries to flat-bat it over long-on, got it off the toe-end and it still almost cleared long-on. Southee first held on to the catch, then saw himself overbalancing, threw the ball up and went out before coming back in to complete the catch. batsman c Southee b bowler 25(21) [4s-2 6s-1]"
5338,"FOUR, that's been so brilliantly placed. Short of length but it's just outside off, so escapes the ignominy of being a short-wide ball and adds to the genius of batsman, who's nicely used his hands to glide it right between short third man and backward point"
5339,"out Caught by SN Thakur!! Ngidi runs his fingers across for some magic. Helped by batsman, who came down the track and backed away early, allowing bowler to take pace off the ball. Checked the flat-batted smack that he intended to clear cow corner with, toe-ended it to mid-on, where Shardul made a somewhat easy catch look difficult. Probably the wind. Stuttered on the first attempt but managed to hold onto it. batsman c SN Thakur b bowler 5(3) [4s-1]"
5340,"FOUR, that's over mid-on. And comfortably. Seam-up back of a length ball that allows batsman a cross-batted swat. Not right out of the middle but the shot thrust meant that it cleared the fielder"
5341,"FOUR, fuller and this has been deliciously chipped over mid-wicket. All timing. No show."
5342,"out Caught by Willey!! bowler has his second! He doesn't celebrate like he usually does. Just stares at the batsman. Not sure why he has been subdued today despite getting the wickets. Probably the pressure leading upto today is the reason. Coming to the wicket, not the kind of shot batsman should be playing when you are trying to rebuild. Tries to take Jaddu on with a slog sweep but doesn't quite get hold of it. There is a deep backward square leg in place, precisely for this and he gobbles to up. More problems for team. batsman c Willey b bowler 7(13)"
5343,"1 run, pushed through quicker from a good length, worked off the back foot through mid-wicket. 11th IPL fifty for batsman! He's been the lone ranger so far with the big names failing. Needs to carry on though"
5344,"FOUR, finds the fence! Much-needed one for team to break the shackles. batsman gets into the act. Used his feet to get to the pitch and what he did well was to go straight down the ground. Cannot afford to play across the line on this pitch and he does the smart thing. Hit it dead straight and Shardul from long-on did try to get to the ball but eventually missed it"
5345,out Caught&Bowled!! Another one bites the dust. bowler is having a field day. What a spell! The slowness of the surface does Parthiv in here. He was early into the flick stroke on seeing the flight and only managed a leading edge straight back to Jaddu who accepts it. Again no real celebrations from bowler. This has been a fantastic spell from the left-arm spinner. Fair to say that he has made a fine comeback after all the criticism. A nice innings from Parthiv but he knew that he should have batted through. batsman c and b bowler 53(41) [4s-5 6s-2]
5346,"out Stumped!! team are being spun to the dumps here. bowler's turn to sneak a wicket now, his second. Wonderfully bowled this, slowed it up and got a bit of drift as well. Lured Ashwin into pushing at it and this just straightened a tad to beat the edge. Dhoni has super quick to whip off the bails and as replays showed, the back leg was just on the line. That was never going to be enough. team sink further .batsman st Dhoni b bowler 1(2)"
5347,"out Caught by Raina!! It's all falling apart here for team. First IPL wicket for bowler and he is thrilled. What a horror stroke from batsman though? He knew that all the responsibility was now down to him and instead of playing through, he decides to go for broke. Never the pitch for that kind of batting and he departs. A cutter on a good length and he tried to slog this away but only managed to skew this high towards extra cover. Raina charged forward to take it with ease. batsman c Raina b bowler 8(8) [4s-1]"
5348,out batsman Run Out!! Bulls eye from Willey at mid-off. Charged to attack the ball and fired in an accurate throw at the bowler's end. Umesh was always struggling to get in and eventually was well short. Fullish ball that was driven off the front foot past the bowler and they were looking to sneak a quick single. Not to be. That sort of day for team when nothing goes right. batsman run out (Willey) 1(5)
5349,"FOUR, lucky runs but team will take them any way they come. Low full toss that batsman wanted to slug away on the leg-side. Gets an inside edge that just whizzes past leg stump. Too fine and short fine leg had no chance"
5350,"FOUR, first ball for Bravo and he has been punished. Fuller ball outside off, batsman unfurls a cracking drive through extra cover. Finds the fence, 100 up for team finally"
5351,"SIX, mighty blow from batsman. So this is why he is denying the single on offer. Backing himself to club a few and does so this time in style. Slightly short and slow from Shardul, pulled away over deep square leg after a slight shuffle. Handy runs these"
5352,"FOUR, this is a very vital cameo from batsman, infusing respectability into the team innings. Funny shot though, walked across the sticks for the paddle scoop and instead skied it towards third man. Very fine and Ngidi tried to get to it, even got a hand on it but could only palm it to the ropes. Dropped!"
5353,out batsman Run Out!! 1 run completed A wicket to cap the innings. Full toss that batsman mistimed towards long-on and they were going for the second run. Had to with this being the last ball but Rayudu's throw at the keeper's end was on target. Dhoni whipped off the bails in a flash and even the dive couldn't save batsman. team end with an underwhelming total. batsman run out (Rayudu/Dhoni) 3(7)
5354,"SIX, he's hit this all the way over long-on. Backs away and makes some room whilst doing so, meaning he could pump the ball away even though bowler was bringing it in wide of the crease"
5355,"FOUR, gee that's disrespectful. Transfers the weight on the front foot and flat-bats it over Thakur's head"
5356,"SIX, read the cutter nicely here. Shifted just outside the line of the ball, which is on middle-stump say, and picked it up -- all the way! -- over backward square"
5357,"FOUR, and he makes me eat crow with a dismantling cover drive. Actually not even that. Far from it. A bit of room on this fuller length delivery and he's slapped it through covers. Threw his hands at it and somehow made it look like the prettiest thing you'll see today"
5358,"out Bowled!! Umm, let me watch it again. bowler is so shellshocked that he takes all the time in the world to make sense of what has happened, and forgets to celebrate. That's what we'll assume. Note the pace: 100.7kmph. Hits a length and straightens it just enough to castle batsman, who was looking to glide it down to third man. Beaten by the pace off the pitch. Just hurried at batsman that. Happens. batsman b bowler 8(11) [4s-1]"
5359,"FOUR, sliding on off-stump from round the wicket, and batsman's greeted him with a reverse-sweep that he deftly places wide of the lone slipper"
5360,"1 run, dropped by Bhajji. Slows the pace down, batsman's early and pops it back at Bhajji. Slightly to his right, bowler went with both hands and that was his undoing. Got himself into a tangle and was late to react"
5361,"out Stumped!! Kohli out, and batsman follows him into the pavilion the next over. Bizarre way to get out actually. He's trying to reverse-paddle an off break from bowler. Stretches way in front to meet that, is beaten by a bit of turn down the leg-side, and then Dhoni is quick. Doesn't even allow batsman a chance. batsman st Dhoni b bowler 1(4)"
5362,"FOUR, top shot! Not much gap between backward point and short third man but Parthiv has found it. To begin with, there wasn't any width on offer as bowler darted this around off, the southpaw still managed to get the cut away. Bhajji is not amused"
5363,"SIX, that's a beautiful shot. On a length outside off, Shaw stands tall, reaches for the widish delivery and towers it over long-on for half a dozen. No one has treated Sandeep in such a way so far in the tournament"
5364,"out Maxwell Run Out!! Can you believe it? Maxwell has been run out, what an unfortunate way to get out. Nothing's going right for Maxwell this year. Was a full length delivery around off and Shaw drove it straight back to the bowler. Sandeep in his followthrough got his hand to it and parried it on to the stumps at the bowler's end. Maxwell is well short of the crease and he has to walk back. Got to feel for the Aussie batsman! Maxwell run out (bowler) 2(3)"
5365,"FOUR, crunched away! Short and wide outside off, Shaw throws his hands at it and crunches it through the gap at cover-point, races away to the fence in a jiffy. How good has he looked in his maiden IPL season!"
5366,"out Caught by S Kaul!! Sunrisers' best bowler strikes, gets the young opener. Tossed up delivery around off, Shaw goes after it with a slog and gets a top edge to short third man. Kaul stationed in the position goes down on his knee and reverse cups it. Fine knock by Shaw, nevertheless. He has laid the foundation for the likes of Pant and other Delhi batsmen. batsman c S Kaul b bowler 65(36) [4s-6 6s-3]"
5367,"no run, Saha has dropped it! Could have been the second wicket for Rashid. Iyer tried to work that short delivery away to the on side but got a thick inside edge. Saha behind the wickets makes a mess of it as the Delhi skipper gets a life"
5368,"SIX, rubbing salt on the wounds. Flighted ball outside off, Iyer goes inside out and chips it to perfection over wide long-off. The fielder tried hard, but the ball just cleared the fence"
5369,"FOUR, a rare blip from Shikhar Dhawan in the field, you won't see this often because he's usually a good fielder. A dipping low full toss on off, Iyer smashes it down to long-off, Dhawan was pretty squarer and had to run across to his right. Did so and in the process, sort of took his eyes off the ball. Or got an awkward bounce too, failed to get his body behind the line of the ball and lets it through to the fence"
5370,"out Caught by Dhawan!! Told ya! Shikhar is a good fielder, compensates for the early fault of his in the previous over as he holds onto a catch and does the 'Thigh five' to get the Hyderabad crowd into a frenzy. Full and on leg, Iyer had the license to go for it. Picked it off his pads and whacked hard, no real timing behind it and hits it straight to Dhawan at deep mid-wicket. batsman c Dhawan b bowler 44(36) [4s-3 6s-2]"
5371,"FOUR, a welcome boundary for batsman, this should get him going. Kaul wafts it full outside off, batsman plonks his front foot forward and blasts it straight back at Kaul, who sticks his hand out but can't cling onto it. Brushes his fingertips and trickles away to the straight boundary. Umpire Bruce Oxenford had to take cover as it was coming at him"
5372,"out batsman Run Out!! Suicidal running and DD lose another wicket. Remember, Pant was involved in a run-out against team as well where he ran his skipper out. Today, it's the turn of Ojha, who has to depart early. Defended to the right of the bowler and Ojha took off, Pant responded and stopped, throwing his partner under the bus. bowler moves across quickly and lasers a throw to the keeper, who does the rest. batsman run out (bowler/Saha) 1(4)"
5373,"out Lbw!! batsman has been given out LBW, he reviews. No issues with the front foot. Clearly no bat there. Only factor that could favour batsman is the height. Hit in-line as well. Ball-tracker is out: 2 reds. Pitched - in-line. Impact - in-line. Wickets - umpire's call. Clipping the top of middle. What a fightback from team this has been. Skiddy leg-break from Rashid on a short of length, batsman went back for the pull and it didn't rise much as he expected. Misses and is rapped on the back thigh. Was given out on-field, he reviewed in hope but in vain. batsman lbw b bowler 18(19) [4s-1]"
5374,"1 run, run-out chance at the non-striker's end missed! Why didn't Kaul collect the ball and break the stumps? Had ample time there as Christian had given up. Poked airly to extra cover, KW fires a throw and misses the target. No backing up and they take the single eventually. Skipper gestures to Kaul that he should've collected the ball"
5375,"SIX, this should ease Shankar's nerves. Much-needed hit for DD. bowler overdoes it; full and outside off, Shankar lines up and smacks it with ferocity over long-on"
5376,"FOUR, Shankar picks the leg-cutter on this occasion. Took a stride forward, opened his bat face and flayed it past point. Sweeper cover fielder couldn't get across and it runs away to the boundary"
5377,"SIX, greets bowler with a glorious shot. Tossed up delivery outside off, Shaw leans forward and times his chip over covers for six more, that's his second one of the night"
5378,"FOUR, boundary to end the over. Short one on the pads and all Shaw has to do is help it on its way. Does so and drags it past the fielder at short fine leg, finds the fence and moves on to 28* with that, was the knuckle ball and Shaw picked it up nicely"
5379,"FOUR, straight down the ground! Another slower delivery on a full length on middle, Iyer stays put and drives it straight back, almost takes down Shaw at the other end who takes evasive action and loses balance. Can't keep a fielder there as Iyer scores his first boundary"
5380,"SIX, he's picking those slower deliveries, those knuckle balls to perfection. This was a full one outside off and Shaw simply smoked it over long-off. Third one of the night for him, he's approaching another fifty"
5381,"FOUR, pulled away! He's looking to make the most of the powerplay. This was a short delivery around off, Shaw picked the length early and pulled it nicely over mid-wicket"
5382,"FOUR, Kaul is feeling the pressure. Struggling with his lines and lengths. Has tried the knuckle ball, the short one but nothing's going his way. This was on the pads and Shaw dragged it down to fine leg with ease"
5383,"FOUR, 20 runs off that Kaul over! Think this is Kaul's most expensive over of IPL 2018. Coming back to the ball it was a shortish one outside off, Shaw transfered his weight on to the back foot and crunched it through the gap at cover, two fielders went for the chase but none could stop that"
5384,"1 run, another fine fifty for Shaw! Has been consistent right throughout. This was a short and low delivery on middle, he flicked that away to deep mid-wicket for a single to reach the milestone"
5385,"FOUR, doesn't even spare bowler. Short one, probably the googly, Shaw camps back and pulls it well past the fielder at deep square leg"
5386,"SIX, that's into the stands! Iyer joins the party, scores his first maximum of the night. Gets to the pitch of the ball and sends it sailing over the man at long-on for a perfectly timed six"
5387,"FOUR, that's a perfect example of a square cut. Was another short delivery outside off and Iyer was on to it in a flash. Rocks back and chops it right into the gap between point and cover-point"
5388,"FOUR, lousy beginning from Avesh. Whangs in a short ball on leg-stump line, forgets the fine leg is inside the circle. Easy picking for batsman, swivels across and helps it over the man at 45. Didn't get it off the middle but enough to clear the fielder"
5389,"FOUR, batsman is aware of the field. Perhaps realised another short ball was coming. Moved away to the leg-side, opened himself up and ramps it over short third man"
5390,"1 run, Maxi drops a skier. He's having a horrible tournament, not amongst the runs and now puts down a sitter. batsman miscues the pull, gets it high on the bat and sends it high into the night sky. Maxi from deep square leg, runs in and slides with both hands cupped. Straight in and out, embarrasses himself and DD"
5391,"out Bowled!! A long stare to the batsman, followed by a loud roar - that's bowler's reaction. He has removed both the openers. Beautiful bowling. Tosses this well above the batsman's eyeline and that entices batsman into a false stroke. He cleared his front leg to hack it over the leg-side and missed it completely. Was bowled full and batsman was beaten in the flight. Middle stump takes the brunt. Replay shows that it was a wrong 'un. batsman b bowler 33(30) [4s-2 6s-1]"
5392,"FOUR, two fielders run across, see each other and neither go for the ball. Comical. Two overseas fielders - Roy and Boult. Was a low full toss and Pandey got underneath it to bunt it over the bowler's head. Long-on should have cut that off. Ordinary stuff!"
5393,"FOUR, now these two boundaries have made a mess of bowler's figures. The length was shortened by bowler, Pandey danced out of his crease and slapped it through covers. In the gap and 13 came off that over"
5394,"SIX, superb shot! Bouncer well outside off, a slight move across from batsman, followed by an upper cut over third man. Both his feet off-ground when he made contact with the ball. Classy shot. Timing and placement was spot on"
5395,"out Caught by Prithvi Shaw!! The teenager takes a high-pressure catch. The cross-seamed fuller length ball, Pandey went too hard on his lofted shot and lost all his shape in the process. Wanted to go downtown and the bat face turned at the point of impact. Went miles up in the air and Shaw settled under it after running back from extra cover. Reverse-cupped. batsman c Prithvi Shaw b bowler 21(17) [4s-2]"
5396,"1 run, dropped! Vijay Shankar at deep backward square leg has put down. Probably lost it a bit and was late to go for the catch. Was a shortish ball on leg and Pathan heaved it flat behind square leg. How costly will that be?"
5397,"SIX, that's a massive hit! Picked the slower ball, was in his slot, and then butchered it over long-on. Fullish and misses his yorker. 22 off 11 now"
5398,"FOUR, gold! bowler misses his mark. Doles out a wide-ish full ball and Pathan reaches out with hard hands. Sliced through backward point and that's gone for a boundary"
5399,"SIX, oh, bowler, what have you done. A full toss and gets the treatment it deserved. Was slightly outside off, Pathan crouches low, got underneath and bludgeoned it over long-on. Poses for the photographs as well. Stylish.."
5400,"FOUR, just 2 needed now! Has to be team's game from here. Pacy bouncer and Pathan goes for the pull. Off the top-edge and goes over the man at short fine leg"
5401,"FOUR, overcorrects and lands a fuller length delivery on the pads. batsman shuffled a bit and that must've put bowler off-guard. Moves inside the line and glances it very fine. The fielder was inside the ring and didn't have any chance"
5402,"FOUR, bowler is spraying it all over the place. Misses the line and ends up offering a buffet ball for batsman down leg. Just needed to get some bat on that. Does so after a half-swivel and runs it down to the fine leg fence"
5403,"SIX, bang! ""Don't ball short to me,"" seemed like the body language of batsman. Knew what was coming, was ready on the back foot as he muscled it way back into the deep square leg stands"
5404,"SIX, no respite for Avesh whatsoever. Tests Alex with a short ball, much like batsman he gets under it and blasts the pull over the mid-wicket fence"
5405,"SIX, this is turning out to be an expensive over for DD. Went full outside off, batsman jumped across and lifted it over mid-off. Not off the sweet spot but enough to take it all the way for a maximum"
5406,"SIX, 27 runs off the over. Avesh has been taken to the cleaners. Drops it short on seeing batsman move to leg. batsman throws it bat and smashes it over the in-field on the off-side. Sails over the ropes by a few inches. Just the momentum team needed at the end of Powerplay"
5407,"FOUR, that's a gift and batsman takes full toll of it. What was that from bowler? Darts a full toss on the pads and batsman won't miss out on those. Bends his back leg and clouts it behind square leg. There's none to stop that"
5408,"out Bowled!! That's an absolute peach. batsman had no clue, still doesn't. Stands in his crease and stares at his stumps in total disbelief. That ball reminded me of the famous ball bowled by Warne to Gatting. bowler gives air on this occasion, gets it to drift in and beats him with the away-turn. Pitched around middle and leg, beat the outside edge and crashed into the off-stump. There's the breakthrough DD were looking for. batsman not happy with Mishy's celebration in his face. Maybe something was said. Kept looking back while walking. batsman b bowler 45(31) [4s-3 6s-3]"
5409,"FOUR, edged and four, a second slip would have swallowed it, back of a length and in that channel outside off, Lynn pushed at that tamely, got a thick edge that flew past the lone slip"
5410,"FOUR, back-to-back boundaries for Lynn and he's away, the slower ball from bowler, it was a back of a length delivery as well, Lynn spotted it early, got on top of the bounce and punched it through cover. Krunal Pandya gave the chase, but the ball sped away to the ropes"
5411,"FOUR, that's good anticipation. Knew bowler will be slow and around off, so shuffles across on his knees and swept this through fine leg. Nicely done"
5412,"FOUR, another slower delivery. Not much to guess out there for batsman at the moment. Stays put and flashes the late cut in front of the backward point fielder. 79 off 51 needed"
5413,"FOUR, first fifty of the season for batsman. He's making a day out of Markande's drop. Another short ball, batsman stays front-footed and heaves that over mid-wicket. Gloriously weird shot"
5414,"FOUR, short and into his right shoulder, and here's what batsman does: Swivels and pulls it through fine leg. Life's ridiculously easy at times"
5415,"out Caught by Cutting!! The cameras rightly pan to Hardik Pandya, who was furious when bowler had dropped batsman on four. Redemption for the young leggie here. First ball to batsman in this new spell and he's taken him out with a leg break. Got it to spin, which meant that batsman, on his front foot and going for the big hit, had to slice it. Carries nice and high to long-off. batsman c Cutting b bowler 54(35) [4s-6 6s-3]"
5416,"out Caught by Bumrah!! Mumbai have found a way past their ex. batsman, as strong as he's through square on the off-side, has a few issues against the short ball. So bowler does exactly that. Angles this seam-up short ball across from over the wicket, has batsman fetching the pull from outside off, and has him top-edging. Taken at deep square leg by Bumrah, who drops down to take it one-handed amidst fears of a spill. batsman c Bumrah b bowler 31(27) [4s-3 6s-1]"
5417,"FOUR, that wasn't too short but look at Russell pin all his weight on the back foot, and deep in the crease, and swat it disparagingly wide of long-on. That fact that he had to summon the ball from outside off tells how powerful Russ is"
5418,"out Caught by Krunal Pandya!! That's a terrific catch from Krunal and Russell falls to a top-edged pull. Hurried by the pace, so looked in no position to play the shot. Backed away, and met the ball with weight on his front foot. Krunal swerved in the deep, anticipating the trajectory and then dived in front at deep backward square to take the catch. Good effort, running back from short fine leg. batsman c Krunal Pandya b bowler 9(10) [4s-1]"
5419,"FOUR, short and wide, and pumped away with an uppish cut shot behind square on the off-side"
5420,"leg byes, FOUR, given as leg byes. Goes for the slower delivery but gets the radar wrong. Slipping down leg; beats the batsman and then the keeper too. 43 needed off 3 overs!"
5421,"FOUR, good follow-up with the slower delivery but got the length wrong. And the line. Shortish outside off, allowing batsman to stay back and flash it square on the off-side"
5422,"SIX, what about the height on this full toss? Looked like it was below the waist. This time batsman makes hay. Slogs it over deep mid-wicket, where Milne is trying to catch that one-handed and leaping. Well over him"
5423,"FOUR, misses the yorker by inches and that's good enough for DK. Went back and got under it, drilling it uppishly through a very straight long-on"
5424,"FOUR, Duminy drops it at deep square and then also lets it go for a boundary. Low full toss, batsman got into a position early and swiveled the hack round the corner. It was right upto Duminy, who went for the reverse cup but lets it through. What's worse: it bounces once before the boundary ropes. Bad. Very bad"
5425,"FOUR, gee this is going south. Krunal has done nothing to allay fears. Bowls a full toss and is hammered down the ground. 19 off 5 needed"
5426,"out Caught by Rohit!! Oh, that's it for batsman. Three consecutive boundaries from team and here's the wicket. KP angles this across batsman, who was always going for it. Gets a toe-end and Rohit nicely traces a few yards back at extra cover to take this. batsman c Rohit b bowler 5(4) [4s-1]"
5427,"FOUR, wide full toss and batsman's carved it over the infield square on the off-side"
5428,"byes, FOUR, a hat-trick of boundaries ruins the over, lovely ball from bowler, cut back in sharply from a length outside off, Lynn was caught on the back-foot as he wafted, got beaten on the inside edge and the ball further swung away, leaving Ishan Kishan stranded"
5429,"FOUR, team are dealing in boundaries at the moment, tad too full and wide of off, Gill gets forward, closed the face of the bat and drives it in between the non-striker and the umpire, no need to run for those"
5430,"FOUR, this is turning out to be a fine start for team, too short and on the stumps, Lynn swivels across, rolls his wrists and pulls it behind square on the on-side, beat short fine and rolled away to the fence"
5431,"FOUR, cracking shot, this short-ball plan isn't working for team, too short and just outside off, Lynn swivels across, rolls his wrists and pulls it in front of square on the on-side, the man in the deep is too square and has no chance"
5432,"out Caught by Bumrah!! A soft dismissal, this came from nowhere but team will gladly take it. The short ball has got them a wicket, Lynn is gutted as he walks away. Banged in short and at the stumps, Lynn had all the time in the world as he pulled, just didn't pick the gap, hits it straight into the hands of Bumrah at short fine. Relief for bowler and team. There's the customary check for the front-foot no-ball, but bowler is fine on that count as well. batsman c Bumrah b bowler 17(13) [4s-4]"
5433,"out Caught by Krunal Pandya!! The Pandya brothers in action and team have lost both openers now. This is a horrendous shot from young Gill though, the slower off-cutter from Hardik, Gill was looking to hoist it out of the stadium, the bat turned on impact as the ball gripped on the surface, the steepling toe-end went high and towards mid-off. The elder Pandya was under the ball, completes it with great composure and all of a sudden - team have lost two. batsman c Krunal Pandya b bowler 7(5) [4s-1]"
5434,"FOUR, lovely, too full and too wide of off, allows Rana to free his arms as he scythes it past cover-point, off the mark with a boundary"
5435,"SIX, short, wide and six, the plan was to bowl short at Rana, bowler had a backward point and a fielder square at point, but this was too short and too wide. Rana got on top of the bounce, used bowler's pace and lashed it over the head of third man"
5436,"no run, chance and dropped, that's a dolly and Markande has somehow dropped it. Then slower short ball outside off, batsman swivelled across on the pull, doesn't get hold of the shot and hit it straight to mid-on. It came at a very good height, Markande went reverse cupped and somehow let the ball pop out"
5437,"SIX, beautifully played, he pre-empted that Krunal was flighting this one, backed away, gets underneath the length and lifts it back over the bowler, clears the sightscreen and it's batsman's first maximum"
5438,"FOUR, cracking shot, the quicker ball from Krunal, but the length was short and wide of off, Rana backs away and beats the man at point with a fierce cut"
5439,"FOUR, nicely played! Rana is looking a million dollars today, tossed up well outside off, Rana picked the length early, bent down low, rolled his wrists and swept it behind square on the on-side, beat the diving fielder in the deep"
5440,"SIX, 4000 IPL runs for batsman, this is excellent cricket, tossed up nicely outside off, it was the wrong 'un and batsman spotted it early, got a big stride forward, hit it with the spin and into the crowd at wide long-on"
5441,"SIX, back-to-back sixes for batsman, bowler drifts this one wider of off, batsman gets forward and thumps it back over the bowler's head, all the way for another maximum, 17 from the over"
5442,"1 run, slower and on off, eased down towards long-on for a single"
5443,"FOUR, a gift and batsman accepts it with glee, full-toss outside off, all batsman had to do was to find the gap, he gets forward and drills it to the right of extra-cover, no chance for the fielder getting across from long-off"
5444,"FOUR, a gift and batsman will not miss out. bowler lost his line as he attempted another slower ball, ends up drifting down the leg-side and all batsman had to do was to whip it into the gap - he does so, behind square on the on-side and team continue to bleed boundaries"
5445,"FOUR, 134.3kph, short and wide outside off, batsman spots the length quickly, gets on top of the bounce and cuts through point. Perfectly placed between backward point and cover-point. First boundary of the match"
5446,"FOUR, fabulous shot! Wee bit of space offered from bowler on this flighted delivery and that is enough for batsman to put it away, strides forward and creams the drive through cover. The timing ensures that sweeper is also beaten"
5447,"1 run, fifty for Yadav. Fourth of the season and it has come against his former team. The sea of blue awaken to applaud the innings and he responds with a wave of the bat. Nudged with the spin past mid-wicket"
5448,"out Caught by (sub)Rinku Singh!! Big wicket for team. Another failure for batsman this season. Only three times he has gone past 20 this season and Mumbai have won on all three occasions. They need someone now to take them close to that 200-mark. An off-spinner and it was too full to be sweeping, batsman could not get underneath it completely and the top-edge skies towards deep mid-wicket. Rinku on as a substitute takes it calmly. batsman c (sub)Rinku Singh b bowler 11(11) [4s-1]"
5449,"FOUR, dropped! Narine got fingertips to it. Floated up around off, Yadav stayed leg-side to play the inside out loft, didn't get the elevation he was looking for and Narine parried it over him. A more agile fielder might have taken it"
5450,"SIX, one-handed six for Pandya. Tossed it up on off, Pandya used his reach to get to the ball and just went through with the loft, the bottom hand comes off and the ball sails over long-off"
5451,"out Caught by Karthik!! Russell might not be bowling at full tilt but he's provided crucial wickets for team throughout the tournament. Got Lewis earlier in the innings and now accounts for a well-set Yadav. A tired shot from Yadav though. Sees the short of length delivery outside off and looks to play the back cut, thin edge and Karthik does the rest behind the stumps. batsman c Karthik b bowler 59(39) [4s-7 6s-2]"
5452,"FOUR, the elder Pandya has made his intentions clear. Anything there to be hit, he's going for it. Short and slanted across off, Pandya transfers his weight back and pulls it over mid-wicket. No protection in the deep there"
5453,"FOUR, slapped! In trying to shorten the length Krishna offers width outside off, Pandya stands tall and cracks the cut square on the off-side, raced away quickly beating sweeper cover"
5454,"FOUR, the last two deliveries ruins the over for Krishna and team. Superb batting though from Pandya. Shuffled across and paddled the back of a length delivery over and wide of short fine leg. Just used the pace of the bowler"
5455,"SIX, bowler became a bit predictable there. Bowling offies on back of a length, Pandya waited back in the crease and then slotted the heave over wide long-on. Enough legs to carry over the rope"
5456,"out Caught by Shubman Gill!! Not happening this time. Similar kind of delivery and similar kind of stroke from Pandya, but he finds the man at long-on. bowler bowls the off-break with a dragged back length, Pandya with his weight back looks to muscle it over Gill, doesn't get enough and the youngsters takes it calmly. batsman c Shubman Gill b bowler 14(11) [4s-1 6s-1]"
5457,"SIX, batsman needs to kick on here. He knew what bowler was doing - bowling back of a length, so he moved across his sticks and muscled the pull over deep mid-wicket. Had to manufacture all the power and he got enough to clear the man"
5458,"FOUR, streaky! This is a cruel game. Krishna deceived the batsman with a good slower delivery, Pandya was through the shot and the outside edge bisects Karthik and short third man perfectly"
5459,"FOUR, if he is going to bowl the wide yorker, then third man needs to be back. Yes, it was a bottom edge but the bowler and captain need to be smart, Pandya reached out with a bent back knee and squirted it off the toe-end to the fence"
5460,"no run, low full toss and Pandya swings so hard that the bat flies out of his hand, he then tries to steal a bye with the bat lying near square leg and Karthik misses to run him out. He was gone by a mile, in the end they don't even go through with the run"
5461,"SIX, in the air and goes all the way! The man in the deep was interested, but the ball goes well over his head. The bouncer from bowler and batsman was hurried by the pace. Still goes with the pull shot and gets a fat top-edge. Had enough wood to clear deep backward square leg"
5462,"FOUR, over-corrects by overpitching outside off. batsman won't miss those. Leans into the drive and caresses it through covers. Raced away"
5463,"FOUR, there's the width and there's the slash to follow that. Bullets away. The length was perfect to be hit. Shortish and angling away, batsman stands tall and cuts it fiercely through backward point"
5464,"FOUR, didn't time it well, but manages to fetch a boundary. This was bowled fuller and batsman went hard on the drive. He probably wanted to go through mid-off and got it off the inside edge. Beats mid-on by a long way and once it beat him, the quick outfield did the rest"
5465,"FOUR, nothing wrong on this occasion from batsman. Saw the length on the shorter side, quickly rocked back and cut it ferociously beating the cover fielder to his left"
5466,"SIX, nicely done! If batsman gets going, it'll be tough to stop him. Krishna pounds in a shortish delivery. batsman is expecting that. Stays back in his crease and pulls it over backward square leg with a swivel. First six for the West Indian"
5467,"SIX, my goodness! That was absolutely murdered. A juicy loopy full toss upfront from bowler. There is no way batsman was missing that. Moves slightly off-side and clouts it over deep square leg. That's colossal"
5468,"FOUR, four more! It was the googly from bowler, not sure if batsman picked it. He went through with his lofted drive and slices it off the outside half. Over the cover region and that dribbles away over the bouindary rope"
5469,"FOUR, got to feel for the bowler. Bamboozled batsman with another googly and batsman was caught in his crease looking to block. Takes the outside edge and races away to the third man fence"
5470,"SIX, good use of the feet from batsman. Puts on the dancing shoes, gets close to the pitch of the ball and swings his bat hard in the direction of the spin. Into the deep mid-wicket stands. Clean strike"
5471,"FOUR, that's a terrific shot! Wristy shot. Fired on leg and batsman had his back leg off-air while he made contact. Whipped powerfully and finds the gap between long-on and deep mid-wicket. Raced away"
5472,"FOUR, how did that go for a boundary. Rana saw the batsman back away and fired a yorker, batsman brings his bat down a touch late and manages to get a toe-end on it. Luckily for the batter, misses the stumps and runs away to third man for another boundary"
5473,"1 run, dropped! That came at a rapid pace and bowler could only get a hand on it. A full toss and batsman hammered it straight down the ground. Rana stuck his left hand out and could only parry it towards mid-wicket. A single nabbed"
5474,"FOUR, 16 runs off the over! Another glorious shot. Bottom hand power. Shimmies down the track, converts into a half-vollet and batsman drove it exquisitely through extra cover. All along the carpet and into the fence. 82/0 after 8 overs!"
5475,"FOUR, wow! That was superbly played. Wasn't a bad ball from bowler. A good length ball on off, batsman went deep in his crease and that allowed him to free his arms. Plays the back-cut perfectly to beat a diving backward point fielder to his left. Third man was inside the circle as well"
5476,out Caught by Chris Lynn!! Andre Russell provides the breakthrough. The slower ball - off the back of the hand - does the trick. On a fullish length outside off and batsman was early into his shot. Looked to biff it downtown and could only get an outside edge that ballooned straight to Lynn at short third man. The 91-run stand has been broken. batsman c Chris Lynn b bowler 43(28) [4s-5 6s-2]
5477,"FOUR, batsman wants to show who is the boss here. He backs away, goes on the top of the bounce and punches it though cover for a four"
5478,"SIX, drifts it on leg-stump and that's been handsomely picked up over long leg. Cross-seamed and skidding on, so batsman had the pace to work with"
5479,"2 runs, nurdles the ball round the corner and hurries back for second run. Stokes with the running one-handed throw but batsman makes it back in"
5480,"out Bowled!! Looked like the knuckle ball. Banged in on a back of a length outside off, batsman looked to pull and chops an inside edge onto his stumps. Another pretty Karun batsman innings that cries for more deliveries at the crease. batsman b bowler 31(23) [4s-2 6s-2]"
5481,"out Caught by D Arcy Short!! Excellent catch! We've seen a few crackers already in this match and here is another one. The pressure was telling on the aggressive batsman and with a spinner on, he decides to take a chance. Slogs this over mid-wicket but only gets height on it and not the distance. Well, actually almost cleared Short who took the catch calmly and ensured that his foot didn't touch the ropes. Smart work. team are clawing their way back here. batsman c D Arcy Short b bowler 4(5)"
5482,"SIX, connects well this time! batsman was getting foxed a bit and decides to transfer the pressure right back on the bowler. Tossed up once more but this was in his arc, he lofted straight through the line over the bowler's head. Into the sightscreen. Relieves the pressure a touch for team"
5483,"FOUR, just past a flying Buttler to his right! Excellent bowling from bowler, totally bamboozled batsman with this off cutter and induced a thick edge on the drive. Buttler did all he could with a dive to his right but couldn't reach it. Raced away fine to the third man fence"
5484,"1 run, direct hit would have got batsman! Rahane was the man at extra cover and his reaction says how much team wanted this. Slower ball that was tapped gently into the off-side, was always a risky run and batsman escapes"
5485,"FOUR, slammed away! Archer just misses his yorker and ends up dishing out a low full toss. Width on offer too and this is crashed past a diving extra cover. Sweeper cover ain't stopping this"
5486,"SIX, that's gone all the way! What a shot! That too under pressure! Mind you this shortish length ball clocked 145kph but that's also what aided batsman here. He stays back and upper cuts it over short third man. Deep into the crowd. Just the over team wanted to ease a few nerves in the dug out. What a way to get to fifty! Top knock but he knows that the job isn't done yet"
5487,"SIX, he is in a hurry to finish this off now, is batsman. Probably not interested in taking this deep. Gets a freebie, slower short ball around leg, doesn't came easier than these with short fine leg in place. He swivels to get inside the line and helps it away down the leg-side with a well-timed pull"
5488,"FOUR, more runs! bowler is being taken to the cleaners here. Came round the wicket and actually got his line right but batsman is in such a mood that he will put even the good ones away. Makes room by backing away and steers it to find the gap. Bisects short third man and backward point with ease"
5489,"SIX, stand and deliver stuff! Poetry in motion, this shot. Length ball alright but look at the way it's been put away by batsman. Holds his shape and lifts it straight over Archer's head. Straight as an arrow and clears the ropes with ease. Just a hit away now, team"
5490,"FOUR, fittingly a batsman signature cover drive to finish the game. He's been fantastic tonight and has calmly ensured an easy win for team. Overcooked from Archer and it's been creamed away off the front foot. Long-off had no chance of cutting it off. team return to winning ways"
5491,"FOUR, batsman backs away and cuts it to the right of cover for a four. Excellent timing and placement!"
5492,"FOUR, cheeky from batsman. He brings out the reverse sweep and plays it fine of the short third man for a four"
5493,"FOUR, He is timing the ball really well. batsman goes inside the line of the ball and slog sweeps it over short fine leg for a boundary"
5494,"FOUR, brute power! Fuller in length from bowler this time, batsman clears his front leg and absolutely smashes it wide of the mid-off fielder for a four"
5495,"out Caught by Samson!! bowler has the last laugh in this mini battle. It was another short of length ball, batsman stays put and smashes the cut shot straight to Samson at point. Ball came at a lighting speed and Samson does really well to hold on it. Universe boss will have to depart without contributing much. batsman c Samson b bowler 8(11) [4s-2]"
5496,"out Caught by R Tripathi!! Dismal IPL for batsman continues. He will consider himself massively unlucky, a meter to the fielder's right or left and that was a four. It was a short of length ball, batsman gets in a good position, connects well, he does everything well but finds the fielder at deep square leg. This just get to show how imperative placement is in cricket. batsman c R Tripathi b bowler 2(3)"
5497,"FOUR, throws his bat at a wide one and sends a thick edge wide of Rahane at second slip. Good effort from Shreyas Gopal at third man to cover a lot of ground to his left, but he fumbled a touch while on the dive and it runs away for a boundary"
5498,"FOUR, terrific shot, batsman portrays his class. It was a fuller length ball at the stumps, batsman brings his bat down gun-barrel straight and drives it straight down the ground for a four"
5499,"FOUR, touch short and batsman makes full use of it. He goes deep in the crease and pulls it to the deep mid-wicket fence for a four"
5500,"FOUR, that shot had class written all over it. He waited and waited for the ball to come and just opens the bat face at the last moment, timing was perfect and so was placement. Ball beats the short third man fielder for a four"
5501,"SIX, batsman doesn't reach the pitch of the ball but he still goes through with the shot and connects well. It was a flighted delivery at the stumps, batsman comes down the track and lofts it over cover with the turn for a six. He hit it inside-out, one of the hardest shots to execute. Ball hit the ropes on the full and umpires are confirming it"
5502,"out Caught by Andrew Tye!! Skipper strikes!! Aimless slog from batsman, stays low and hacks across the line; Ash slowed it up nicely to get that extra rip, it catches the top-edge and flies high for mid-on who takes a tumbling catch after a swirling dance. Tye it is. batsman c Andrew Tye b bowler 2(2)"
5503,"FOUR, that's easy for batsman! Bowls short and outside off, batsman lets his lovely hands take over. Crisply punched through covers. CYA LATER"
5504,"FOUR, batsman is such a dangerous player at the top and this is why? Gets a short ball outside off, he half-swivels and pulls nonchalantly over mid-wicket. No-one there"
5505,"byes, FOUR, unlucky for the bowler but batsman and team won't mind. Shuffled miles across his off-stump to try the funky paddle-scoop over the keeper, but bowler sprayed it too far outside off to foil his plans, result? It flies past the helpless keeper"
5506,"FOUR, short and wide, batsman lashes that behind point. Gee, he's hit that with some power. Third man ain't getting there"
5507,"out Caught by Nair!! That was middled to perfection, but right to the fielder near the fence at the same time. Shortish delivery around off, batsman picks the length early and pulls it nicely but Nair stationed at deep square leg moves to his right and reverse cups it just near the fence. batsman fails to capitalise on the start as Royals lose their third wicket. batsman c Nair b bowler 28(23) [4s-2 6s-1]"
5508,"FOUR, sweet sound on that cracking shot by batsman. This was pushed through outside off by bowler and batsman was quick to camp back and slam it to the right of long-off. Beats the man chasing it with utter ease"
5509,"FOUR, is it batsman' night? Looking at the way he's played so far, definitely looks like. This was a flat delivery and full in length outside off, batsman went for the reverse sweep and got it right past the fielder at short third man"
5510,out Caught by Manoj Tiwary!! This is an excellent catch! Brilliant work by the two fielders in the deep. A tag-team effort by Mayank Agarwal and Manoj Tiwary results in his down fall. batsman came down the wicket and towered it to long-off where Mayank grabbed it and just as he was about to lose balance he parried it to Tiwary who comes running in from long-on and takes it. batsman stands there in disbelief but he has to walk back. Was looking so good but nothing to take away from the fielders there. batsman c Manoj Tiwary b bowler 12(9) [4s-2]
5511,"FOUR, successive fifties for batsman. Moving up the order is certainly doing wonders for him. Short and wide outside off, batsman camps back and cuts it through the gap at cover point"
5512,out Caught by Rahul!! batsman departs soon after reaching his fifty. Maybe a lapse in concentration there. This was darted outside off and as batsman tried to run it down to third man he got a thick outside edge. Rahul behind the wickets takes a sharp catch as Royals lose their fifth wicket. bowler gets his second wicket. batsman c Rahul b bowler 51(39) [4s-7]
5513,"out Bowled!! What a jaffa! bowler is on a hat-trick. Archer had no clue about this, stands there in disbelief just like Stokes did earlier when that catch was taken. This pitched on off and came back sharply to go through Archer's defence. Takes down the middle stump and Royals are in danger of getting bowled out well within the 20 overs. batsman b bowler 0(1)"
5514,"FOUR, misfield by Mujeeb results in a boundary. bowler isn't pleased one bit with the effort and has his hands on his hips. This was a short and wide delivery that was cut to square third man by batsman. Mujeeb guarding that region lets it through and gifts four runs to the opposition"
5515,"out Caught by Stoinis!! Another one bites the dust. Was a short delivery around off, batsman went for a pull but the pace was too good for him and the batsman ended up splicing it to short mid-wicket. Can't get any easier for Stoinis who grabs it with both hands. This is why bowler was brought back into the attack and he gets a wicket, doesn't disappoint his skipper. batsman c Stoinis b bowler 5(3) [4s-1]"
5516,"FOUR, won't be able to stop this though. Short again and outside off, Tripathi makes the most of the provided width and cuts it in the same direction once again. Mujeeb sprints to his right but the ball is too quick for him"
5517,"out Caught by Ashwin!! Punjab continue to chip at the wickets. It was the slower delivery this time around. Full without much pace in it, Tripathi lofts it but is too early in his shot. The ball spoons up to wide mid-off where Ashwin completes a safe catch. Can Punjab clean up Rajasthan's tail? Or will we get to see a fight from the Royals? batsman c Ashwin b bowler 11(13) [4s-1]"
5518,"FOUR, that shot was all about timing. How quickly it ran away to the fence, quite surprising. A low full toss on leg and Gopal times his on-drive. Mayank at long-on tried hard to cut this down but couldn't stop the boundary"
5519,"FOUR, these are useful runs for Royals. They'll take it and Gopal is playing a sweet little cameo here. A full length delivery outside off and the batsman slices it over point and gets a boundary"
5520,"FOUR, four more! Drags the length back and bowls a slower one outside off, Gopal goes after it with hard hands and gets an outside edge. Eludes the man at short third man and gets back-to-back boundaries"
5521,"FOUR, not again! Another short delivery in batsman's arc, he transfers his weight onto the back foot and smashes the hell out of that leather over mid-wicket"
5522,"FOUR, batsman is pouncing on anything short. He opens up his stance slightly to give himself enough leverage on the off-side, jumps back and clatters it past extra cover"
5523,"out Shreyas Gopal Run Out!! Wicket to end the innings. That sums up the innings for Royals as Rahul denies them the bye. It was a slower delivery around off, batsman was early in his pull again, got beaten and as Gopal tried to sneak in a bye, Rahul had a direct hit at the striker's end. Shreyas Gopal run out (Rahul) 24(16) [4s-3]"
5524,"out Caught by Gayle!! Chris Gayle is claiming a catch and the replays suggest it is O-U-T. batsman's struggles continue. Dropped short and ripped away from batsman's reach, he goes for the cut and slashes it hard in front of backward point and guess who? It's the Universal Boss, Chris Gayle. Dives full length and nestles it inches above the turf. Good reflexes. batsman c Gayle b bowler 5(7)"
5525,"SIX, batsman likes it there, no spin and slightly short, he sends it into the orbit over wide long-on. So easy. Just makes batting look so simple this lad"
5526,"FOUR, dished wide of off-stump, batsman frees his arms and clobbers it past backward point"
5527,"FOUR, half-volley outside off, batsman's back lift is so high that it allows him to cream those drives through extra cover. Advantage batsman when you bowl full. Timed and placed to perfection..."
5528,"FOUR, more than 80 percent of batsman's runs have come off short deliveries so far. team aren't learning. To make matters worse, Tye sprays it down leg and all batsman needed to do was help it on its way. Karun Nair dives, but all of that sliding effort goes in vain"
5529,"FOUR, beautiful shot! The inswinger from bowler but it's a touch too straight. Parthiv flicks it elegantly through in front of square on the leg-side and beats the fielder in the ring. Races away"
5530,"FOUR, finds the gap this time. Just past a diving mid-on to his right. Fuller ball attacking the stumps, forced away off the front foot past the bowler. Once it beat the infield, it was always going to the fence"
5531,"FOUR, flashes at this googly turning away from him and the edge zooms over slip. Dhawan barely had any time to get his hands up"
5532,"out Bowled!! He's got him this time and off goes Rashid. Oh what celebrations. It's the big wicket of AB batsman, who goes for the cut shot again off the googly and perishes. Tried backing away to it, but the ball kept creeping in to deny the room. Eventually, crashes into the stumps off the under-edge. This game has come alive. batsman b bowler 5(8)"
5533,"FOUR, two boundaries for Moeen so far, one off the outside edge and this one off the inside. Almost chopped it back onto off-stump. Back of length outside off, loosely wafts at it with cemented feet and gets lucky"
5534,"out Caught by Saha!! Given. Sunrisers bowlers roaring back into this. They could be ahead in the game now actually. Back of length delivery angled away from off, Moeen fancies a front-foot pull but all he does is get a faint under-edge through to Saha. Didn't look comfortable during his stay at all. batsman c Saha b bowler 10(7) [4s-2]"
5535,"FOUR, oh this is not good from Siddarth Kaul. A good over is spoiled as he lets the ball slip through his hands at the boundary. Back of length, batsman drags his pull through mid-wicket wide of the deep fielder. Should still have only been two at most. But Kaul couldn't get a hand on it while tumbling to his left"
5536,"SIX, what a blow! He takes this leg-break on and hacks it across the line over mid-wicket. Brute power from Colin batsman. Hits the cushions on the flush"
5537,"SIX, COLIN DE GRANDHOMME! Back-to-back sixes off bowler for the New Zealand batsman. Sits on his back knee and wallops the slog-sweep over deep mid-wicket"
5538,"FOUR, good yorker from bowler, but he has to watch in agony as batsman's toe-edge runs away past short third man"
5539,"1 run, the inside edge saves him. An inswinging full ball on middle and leg, crashes into batsman's back pad as he sets up to slog. They'll take the single towards backward point. What an over from Kaul. Brilliant death bowling"
5540,"FOUR, nails this one. Parthiv is keen to take bowler on. Sees it floated up into the left-hander and launches the slog-sweep over mid-wicket. Clean strike"
5541,"FOUR, hammered away. Parthiv is on a roll here. Baffling though to see KW hand the ball to a left-arm spinner in the Powerplay with the ball not really turning. Fuller ball around middle and leg, lofted cleanly over mid-on and it races away to the fence"
5542,"out Lbw!! Okay, I take my words back. Masterstroke it has turned out to be from KW. There was risk in bringing the left-arm spinner but the idea was to tempt Parthiv into a rash stroke. He did get a couple away but not this time. It was pushed through quicker in line of the stumps and he went for a slog sweep across the line. Missed and it pinged him flush on the pads. Easy call for the umpire as far as the LBW is concerned. Parthiv did wonder about the review but then rightfully continued walking. batsman lbw b bowler 20(13) [4s-4]"
5543,"out Bowled!! Sensational bowling from bowler Kumar. Just brilliant. No way anyone's hitting this ball for six. De Grandhomme anticipates the yorker, walks across premeditatedly but he still can do nothing about it. Drags it off the inside edge and leaves his stumps in a mess. Leaves team's season in a mess. batsman b bowler 33(29) [4s-1 6s-2]"
5544,"FOUR, the signature Virat batsman cover drive! Short cover got a hand on it, mid-off tried to get to his left and put in a slide but it beat them both en route to the fence. Too full from bowler and it's creamed away off the front foot"
5545,"FOUR, mowed away over mid-wicket. batsman has had enough of plodding around. Sees this arm ball on a good length and clobbers it over mid-wicket. Easily over the infield"
5546,"SIX, glorious stuff from the team captain! He has come out with clear intent and has decided to unsettle bowler. Expects the floater and is down the pitch in a flash. Lofts it dead straight over the bowler and into the sightscreen"
5547,"FOUR, got it finer than he intended to but he won't mind. Flatter and closer to off, executes the late cut and it dribbles away off the outer half. Beats short third man easily and speeds to the fence"
5548,"FOUR, new bowler but the strategy from batsman continues to be the same - attack! Charges down the track early and plays his favorite pick-up stroke over mid-wicket. Rashid in the deep had a bit of ground to cover and tried hard but in vain. The team skipper is pumped up, that's for sure"
5549,"1 run, Kaul spills a dolly! He had enough time to judge this but rushed into the catch and eventually, it slipped and crashed into his neck before falling to the ground. Was a quickish delivery and batsman mistimed the pull due to the bounce. Kaul from deep backward square leg anticipated it well and got to it nicely as well, just couldn't complete the job. batsman lucky in the end. How much will this cost team?"
5550,"out Bowled!! The drop doesn't cost team at all in the end. Atrocious stroke from batsman though and is undone by some wily bowling from Sandeep. Slower ball and batsman was early into the sweep by moving across the stumps. Took a piece of the bat, the pad and then disturbed the stumps. batsman stood there in disbelief, probably wondering how he got out. I reckon he should wonder why he tried this shot. batsman b bowler 8(10)"
5551,"FOUR, goes through KW's hands at first slip! Is this the game for team? Massive moment in the game. batsman plays this leg break off the back foot and ends up edging it straight to his opposition counterpart. Williamson didn't expect it to come so quickly perhaps and it went through him to the fence"
5552,"out Caught by Y Pathan!! One-handed ripper from Yusuf! What's with IPL these days? Gayle picked up one yesterday and another big man does today. Huge wicket for team and bowler has picked this up with a nothing ball to be honest. Skidded through off a good length and batsman wanted to go across the line. Got hurried into it and ended up spooning it towards short third man where the big Pathan leapt, stretching his right hand. And it stuck folks, it stuck. Look at the joy on the team fielders' faces. Game on, then. batsman c Y Pathan b bowler 39(30) [4s-5 6s-1]"
5553,"FOUR, picks the slower delivery and pulls wide of mid-wicket. On the front foot too, with the weight going forward, hit the gap perfectly and it raced away"
5554,"FOUR, poor delivery to follow. Very short, batsman had all the time to rock back and pull. Chooses his area and gets it wide of CdG at deep square. Should've dived but didn't"
5555,"FOUR, CdG comes on and serves up a short and wide delivery outside off, again batsman shows off his cutting skills. Plays it late and gets it to the right of backward point. No chance for third man who is pretty square, well placed"
5556,"FOUR, anything drifting into the pads is easy for batsman. He glances and gives fine leg no chance. Poor from Yadav"
5557,"SIX, what a waste of an extra ball and batsman is too good a player to let that full-toss sliding down leg go. Nonchalantly whips and leaves deep backward square a spectator. Sailed over his head and that's a good over for team"
5558,"SIX, that's a beautiful shot. Class from batsman. Tossed up leggie outside off, too full and he has knelt down and slog-swept it flat over deep mid. Consecutive maximums for the team skipper"
5559,"1 run, tossed up outside off, pushed to deep cover. 50 for KW. What a player and captain he has been for team. And to think that he wouldn't have got in had Warner been here. Fifth fifty of the IPL and once again he is shepherding this innings"
5560,"FOUR, mid-off is in and batsman goes over extra-cover, slower delivery outside off, batsman waits and waits, before lofting into the gap. He is getting a move on now"
5561,"out Caught by Mandeep!! High in the air and caught at long leg. Very tight call. As far as no-ball is concerned. Umesh has an inch of the spike behind the line. That should do. batsman walked across to this slower delivery, aimed to go leg-side, but it looped off a thick top edge and Mandeep made no mistake. Just when batsman was changing gears he gets out. team needed that. batsman c Mandeep b bowler 56(39) [4s-5 6s-2]"
5562,"FOUR, backward square is in and batsman splits him and short fine leg, with a heave. Length ball on off, thick inside edge is enough to go into the gap"
5563,"FOUR, brilliant improvisation. Takes it from middle and scoops wide of short fine. Nothing wrong from bowler who attempted the yorker, didn't nail it and it was the cleverness of batsman that outwitted him there"
5564,"out Caught by U Yadav!! bowler gets batsman. Good bowling. Bowled the cutter outside off, made batsman fetch the slog and he cannot clear backward square. Last over he managed a boundary, not this time. batsman c U Yadav b bowler 35(32) [4s-5]"
5565,"FOUR, Pathan knows what is coming. Gets inside the line to this short of length delivery, pulls over and wide of short fine, races away. bowler became to predictable there. Needs to bowl the yorker"
5566,"FOUR, no he doesn't. A slower ball short bouncer, at the head of Pathan, who hooks and gets it fine of Parthiv Patel, no chance for him. Successive fours and poor from bowler"
5567,"out Bowled!! That's pace and it has knocked Pathan's leg stump out of the ground. bowler leaps and punches the air to celebrate. Big wicket that. Hint of tail on this angled in delivery, beats the heave and takes out the stump. batsman b bowler 12(7) [4s-2]"
5568,"SIX, smashed. batsman backs away and clatters the half-volley on the stumps back over the head of bowler, flat hit and it went all the way. Power from the diminutive batsman"
5569,"out Bowled!! The stumps are a royal mess. 146 clicks this one and it has beaten batsman for sheer pace. Fired in on middle and leg, batsman was looking to scoop and saw two of his pegs splattered. bowler jumping and punching the air for joy. End of a very good spell. batsman b bowler 8(5) [6s-1]"
5570,"out batsman Run Out!! 1 run completed. No chance of two and batsman is miles out. Spliced pull by batsman, lands in the mid-wicket area, Kohli charges and fires in an accurate throw to Parthiv Patel who does the rest. batsman run out (Kohli/Parthiv Patel) 1(3)"
5571,"out S Kaul Run Out!! 1 run completed. Confusion and Kaul is gone. Swiped to deep mid, again Kohli is quick and a bit of an yes-no situation, accurate throw on the bounce to Parthiv Patel who whips the bails off, leaving Kaul out. He needed to dive but didn't. team finishing strongly. S Kaul run out (Kohli/Parthiv Patel) 1(1)"
5572,"FOUR, full on off, batsman goes through with the loft and even though he didn't get it off the middle of the bat had enough power to clear the fielder at mid-off. The extra ball goes for four and the team crowd including actor Venkatesh are on their feet"
5573,"out Bowled!! The middle stump goes for a toss. bowler does it again. A cross-seam delivery on middle, which batsman missed. Pretty ordinary as he was looking to turn it to leg, closed the bat face too early and saw his middle stump flattened. batsman b bowler 5(5) [4s-1]"
5574,"FOUR, easy for batsman. He is a class player. A gift from bowler, down leg, with fine leg inside the circle, a beautiful leg-glance and batsman is off the mark with four"
5575,"out Lbw!! Review off the last ball. Would you believe it? It is bowler who has asked Kohli for it. Has Sandeep got outside the line? The original call was not out. Hawk-Eye in and it shows that Sandeep hasn't got outside the line. Three reds and gone. Cheeky from Sandeep, tried to reverse-sweep a full ball on off, missed and once he didn't get bat on that he was dead. Strong final over from bowler and team. batsman lbw b bowler 0(1)"
5576,"FOUR, bowler got that wrong. Tried something different with the slower delivery, floated it up full and wide outside off, batsman crashed the drive wide of mid-off. Left everyone motionless. Replays show that it was the knuckle ball from bowler, went wrong"
5577,"out Caught by Southee!! batsman holes out and the local boy bowler has his arms raised in triumph. Short at the body, batsman pulls but this is a big ground, so didn't have the power to clear Southee at deep backward square. He is a very good fielder and won't drop those. An important wicket for batsman is one man who can score at a fast clip. batsman c Southee b bowler 13(19) [4s-1]"
5578,out Caught by Kohli!! What a soft dismissal. And full credit to Kohli for placing himself there. Chipped in the air and straight to the team skipper. Did batsman not realise Kohli was right in his face? He swings the air with his bat in frustration. Held up on the pitch and tamely played by Manish. bowler was surprised as well as how easily he got that wicket. batsman c Kohli b bowler 5(7)
5579,"FOUR, that's a good cut. Dangerous but batsman plays late and takes it from off, delays the shot to get it wide of the diving Umesh at short third. Much needed boundary for team"
5580,"FOUR, beautiful batting. Down the pitch and to the flight of the ball, lofted clean over bowler and bisects the two men on the straight boundary. Brings the crowd back into life"
5581,"FOUR, batsman responds by coming down the track, he reaches the line of ball and lofts it over cover for a four"
5582,"out Caught by Rahane!! Half the side back in the hut. team are back in this!! A nothing shot from batsman, sits back and looks to loft-drive bowler over cover, but he hadn't quite read the pace on this. It did stop a tad and he ended up spooning it towards cover where Jinks dives full length to grab it cleanly. batsman c Rahane b bowler 7(8)"
5583,"byes, FOUR, it's a Test pitch now. Or seems like it. Spins in from outside off, sneaks through batsman's drive away from the body and misses off-stump by a whisker - in the way also beating Buttler to his left"
5584,"FOUR, heaved away. That kinda slower delivery that gives away its cards early because it's been pitched on a length. batsman delays his cross-batted mow and picks a boundary through wide long-on. Uppish and safe"
5585,"out batsman Run Out!! 1 run completed. Run out appeal here. Slower and wider, batsman dragged it to long-on, where the fielder ran across and fired a throw to Buttler, with the batsmen trying to go for the second. batsman wasn't sure about the second, even put his hand up but Rahul was through, and he had to oblige. That's touch and go actually, the run out. Diving batsman's bat is just about at the line when Buttler takes the bails off. Oh dear, that's a tough one for the third umpire. And it's been given out.. Small margins and it goes against the batsman this time. batsman run out (Binny/Buttler) 9(5) [4s-1]"
5586,"FOUR, leg cutter and batsman's smashed him off the front foot. Shortish, decking away, and hammered through mid-wicket with utter disadain. Another day at work, another fifty for batsman"
5587,"1 run, yorker on the stumps this time, batsman opens the face of the bat to point. Quick single but Stoinis makes it in"
5588,"FOUR, fetches it from outside off and heaves it between mid-wicket and long-on. Shuffled just a bit from leg to off, got behind the line and let his bottom hand take over"
5589,"FOUR, not great cricket overall, except from bowler. Bowled the slower one that spins away, batsman looked ungainly while chipping this, because he was aiming cow corner. Just manages to clear mid-off, and there's Unadkat in the deep, sliding with the ball into the ropes.."
5590,"FOUR, oh that's another stunner from batsman. Shuffled across and timed his pick-up scoop just right. Not easy if that's almost a yorker from bowler. Perhaps an inch short but how good was batsman, laying into it like it's a right he's earned"
5591,"FOUR, this boundary means that 32 is required off the last over. batsman gets into the scoop position again, and ramps this up over short fine leg"
5592,"out Caught by Gowtham!! Sehwag's smiling in the dug out, perhaps because he's seen Gowtham take the catch and put the ball in his pocket. Very cool. A full toss outside off that batsman timed well but this is a big ground, we must remember. So there's Gowtham waiting at a square deep cover, timing his leap just perfect to reverse-cup the ball above his head. batsman c Gowtham b bowler 11(16)"
5593,"SIX, he's ready for the cutter. Stays leg-side of the ball and pumps the free-hit delivery over covers. Highest score for him in IPL"
5594,"FOUR, now he's opened his stance completely here. Chest facing the bowler as he reverses this over short third man"
5595,"SIX, this is a much better shot from batsman. He backs away, makes room for himself and cuts it over point, connection was so good that it sails over the ropes"
5596,"wide, out Stumped!! Astute bowler gets the better of batsman. Terrific plan this and equally good execution. It was fired down the leg-side, batsman came down the track and was strangled outside the crease; Buttler behind the stumps takes off the bails quickly. Back to back failures for the universe boss against team. batsman st Buttler b bowler 1(1)"
5597,"out Bowled!! batsman had taken a couple of brilliant decisions this season, but this was an absolute disaster. Dream of a delivery from bowler, his confidence was high after taking Gayle and he gives this ball ample air; the ball turned, gripped and went through the bat-pad gap of batsman. Ash was trying to mow across the line and it ended up looking silly. batsman b bowler 0(2)"
5598,"FOUR, another similar open-chested reverse-hack over short third man but unfortunately, it's not enough for team. Rajasthan Royals win by 15 runs"
5599,"out Caught by Unadkat!! Oh dear! What are Punjab doing here, self-destruction of the highest order. It was a short ball at the body, batsman was hurried by the extra pace as he wanted to pull it, but the ball got big on him and he ends up slicing it. Unadakat from mid-wicket goes back and takes a brilliant catch, it is never easy taking such catches, but Unadkat made it look easy. batsman c Unadkat b bowler 3(5)"
5600,"FOUR, batsman latches on anything loose, he absolutely does. It was a fuller length delivery outside off, batsman reaches for it and slams the drive over point"
5601,"FOUR, treat to watch! Good length delivery outside off, batsman gets into good position and drives it sumptuously through cover, raced away all along the carpet"
5602,"no run, fuller length delivery and batsman hits it straight to cover, he wanted a single but Akshdeep Nath wasn't interested at all. And when the fielder picked up the ball batsman was almost in the mid crease, he had given up but throw was wayward and batsman gets away with it"
5603,"no run, team have gone up for a lbw review against Nath. The pertinent point is whether it has hit the bat first or pad? No bat involved. It hit the pad first, but the ball straightened enough to miss the off pole. It was a flighted delivery, Nath was prodding forward to tap, but the ball gripped off the pitch to clip him high on the front pad"
5604,"FOUR, excellent shot from batsman. This will give him some confidence. He comes down the track and at the same time makes room for himself to loft it over deep cover for a handsome boundary"
5605,"out Caught by Gowtham!! bowler was bowling beautifully and this was always on the cards. It was a flighted delivery at the stumps, batsman went for a wild swing against the turn, he ends up mistiming it high in the air, long-off comes under it and takes it easily. Punjab are in real trouble now. batsman c Gowtham b bowler 9(13) [4s-1]"
5606,"FOUR, touch short, batsman picks up the length quickly, goes deep in the crease and pulls it through deep mid-wicket for a four"
5607,"FOUR, 135.7kph. Strays. Feeds the pads, trying out the surprise inswinger after the set up with a couple of away ones, gets it wrong and batsman is quick to whip, neatly behind square"
5608,"FOUR, oh the punch. Walks down, gets behind the line, on top of the good length, and straight bats, down the ground"
5609,"FOUR, gets the width, makes it look worse moving away and inside-outs it over extra cover. Ah, the delight of watching him open"
5610,"SIX, fuller, wider, worse. batsman doesn't need to make room, there's plenty already. Crouches low and lofts an uppish slap. Over covers, again"
5611,"FOUR, very, very poor effort from Tye. Too lazy to bend down and bowler is not happy at all. Slashed wide of long-off, Tye moves across to his left, went with one-hand pretty late and ends up letting it roll away to the fence"
5612,"SIX, this was the shot he was looking off the last ball, gets it right on this occasion. bowler drops it short just outside off, batsman goes back and flat-bats it with brute power to smash it over long-on"
5613,"FOUR, 50-stand comes up between the duo. Overdoes the carrom ball. Short, wide and width for the taking, batsman accepts it with glee and slaps it past cover-point. No sweeper cover and it'll be a boundary"
5614,"out Caught by Manoj Tiwary!! bowler strikes. Suckered batsman by tossing it up and the Kerala lad fell into the trap. It was in the slot for batsman, he cleared his front leg and whacked hard - the bat face turns on impact and he ends up slicing it straight to long-on. Dolly for Tiwary and Punjab break the stand. Rahman, with the golden arm. batsman c Manoj Tiwary b bowler 22(18) [4s-1 6s-1]"
5615,"FOUR, biceps and triceps. Wrists and fists from batsman. Gets into business by backing away to leg and hammers it over the bowler's head. So powerful! Picked the safest spot in the ground as well"
5616,"3 runs, in the air and batsman gets away. Akshdeep Nath puts down a toughie. batsman loses his shape and sends a leading edge into the night sky towards long-off. Nath sprinted forward, guess he picked it late as he saw Tiwary approaching from extra cover. Decided to go for it in the end, got both hands but shells it. bowler won't be happy"
5617,"out Stumped!! And batsman doesn't make use of the reprieve. His watch is ended, however has done his job. The wily mystery spinner from Afghanistan picks up his second wicket. Saw the batsman advancing, pushed it through quicker and held it short too. batsman didn't get to the pitch and misses his attempted slog. Easy stumping for Rahul. Two set batsmen back in the hut for the Royals. Rahman tops the wicket-takers chart with this scalp. batsman st Rahul b bowler 82(58) [4s-9 6s-1]"
5618,"SIX, whoa! batsman gets into the act. Read the knuckle ball from Tye, it was full in the arc for batsman. He just extended his arms and lofted with a clean swing of the bat over long-on"
5619,"out Binny Run Out!! 1 run completed. Another one falls. Royals in a bit of strife here. A fuller length delivery outside off, batsman blasted it to long-off. Karun Nair, the fielder was a little squarer and the second run was on. But after collecting it with a sliding stop, Nair released the throw in a flash accurately to the bowler. Binny was too casual and didn't bother to dive, which would've saved him. Not to be today. Binny run out (Nair/bowler) 11(7) [6s-1]"
5620,"out Caught by Ashwin!! A wicket against run of play and Tye nets the big fish. batsman gone. The wheels are coming off for Rajasthan Royals. Tye hurls a low full toss outside off, batsman goes for the across-the-line swipe and loses his shape completely. Skews it off the bottom to extra cover. Skipper Ash swallows it up. Tye is chuffed to bits. batsman c Ashwin b bowler 14(11) [4s-1]"
5621,"out Caught by Manoj Tiwary!! team continue to lose wickets in clusters. Two wickets in three balls now. Superb bowling from Tye. Unleashes the knuckle ball and dupes Archer, who swung high in the air. Only height. Skies it into the dark sky towards long-off. Tiwary is safe as houses. batsman c Manoj Tiwary b bowler 0(1)"
5622,"FOUR, oh, this will do for the Royals. Finally, batsman gets some bat. Goes low and scoops this full ball at the stumps over short fine leg"
5623,"FOUR, 134.6kph. Warms up with a rather innocuous back of a length sitter. batsman doesn't need any further warming up though. He stays up tall, rocking back and flat-bats. Hard. Crunched through mid-wicket"
5624,"FOUR, third man isn't there. batsman has a measure of it, and holds his cut back. Waits, lets it get close and chops it to pierce slip and short third, to perfection"
5625,out Caught by Nair!! A wicket to cap off the innings. Fourth scalp for Tye - who's had a field day with the ball. Lands the knuckle ball on a fuller length at the stumps. batsman had to go for it and lifted it high. Straight into the gullet of Nair at long-on. Catching has been really good from Punjab today. batsman c Nair b bowler 0(1)
5626,"out Caught by Akshdeep Nath!! His lack of runs continue. And the first change up of the day - the knuckle ball has an instant reward. batsman doesn't spot, tries going airy over mid-wicket with his flick. Runs down as well as he does so, closes early, spooning up the leading edge. Only as far as extra cover. And Akshdeep has a calm auspicious start. batsman c Akshdeep Nath b bowler 9(10) [4s-1]"
5627,"FOUR, 134.1kph. So damn deft. A seam up outside off, and batsman, lines himself up, opening his bat face very late, just to guide it through the cordon. The empty cordon"
5628,"SIX, the punch. The pose. Gets the length right in his slot, loads, shows up the full face and tonks it straight down. Talk about the lack of respect"
5629,"FOUR, overcooked on the legs. And batsman owns him, all bottom-hand in this whippy on-drive. He knows there's no long-on, and he bisects the ones inside the ring to perfection"
5630,"FOUR, further dismissive. Tye overcorrects his line, goes outside off, but the length remains just as friendly. Matters taken over the covers now, leg-bent, hands flowing and creaming it one-bounced"
5631,"out Caught by Manoj Tiwary!! The promotion experiment to force things along doesn't pay off. batsman has a role to slog, he clears his front leg and tries hoicking the fuller length into long-on. But the pace is just not there, sticks into the surface, spits up, miscues and finds long-on to perfection. batsman c Manoj Tiwary b bowler 8(6) [6s-1]"
5632,"1 run, shuffles to take it on the pads, and tickles it to short fine. What's more - it's a fifty, stealing the opening spot"
5633,"FOUR, sprays it down leg. batsman's quick to latch on, swivelling, swiping flat and hammering it fine"
5634,"FOUR, just over. For a second batsman would have had his heart in his mouth. The full length delivery from bowler, batsman stays leg-side and toe-ends the loft over Rohit at mid-off. He was standing well inside the circle. Had he been on the edge, he would have gobbled that up"
5635,"out Caught by Krunal Pandya!! batsman gone. This was always on the cards. The short of length delivery has caused problems for batsman and he succumbs to it. bowler angled it into the left-hander and batsman went through with the flat-batted pull, high on the bat and a skier to mid-on. Krunal steadies himself under the night sky and pouches it calmly. Perfect start for team and not so for team. batsman c Krunal Pandya b bowler 4(2) [4s-1]"
5636,"FOUR, streaky! But Lynn won't mind it. He's off the mark with a boundary. The idea from bowler is to push it across the right-hander, Lynn throws everything at the drive and the outside edge runs away fine"
5637,"FOUR, now on the other side of the ground. bowler needs to stick to one plan. Short and on leg-stump, Lynn didn't go hard on the pull, just relied on placing it fine and pocketing a boundary"
5638,"FOUR, streaky! Once again Curran plays down the wrong line. He wanted to punch the back of a length delivery and got an inside edge, the ball flies over the stumps and goes away to the fine leg fence"
5639,"FOUR, short of length delivery angled away outside off, batsman delightfully ramps it over slip. Lovely touch"
5640,"out Caught by Ishan Kishan!! Very loose shot, especially with a slip in place. He's trying to steer this back of length delivery with an open face down to third man. All he does is poke it off the outside edge to Ishan Kishan. team going down in a heap. batsman c Ishan Kishan b bowler 5(3) [4s-1]"
5641,"FOUR, short of length, sits up for Curran who whacks it away through mid-wicket. Dismissive pull shot"
5642,"FOUR, awful delivery. Short of length ball down leg, batsman helps it away past the keeper"
5643,"out Caught by Suryakumar Yadav!! Holes out in the deep. Swiped across the line of this slower ball, but got it right off the toe-end. The line was a touch wide of off, which didn't work in his favour either as he had to fetch it. Right down the throat of Suryakumar at deep mid-wicket. batsman c Suryakumar Yadav b bowler 11(13) [4s-1]"
5644,"2 runs, healthy deflection off the edge, can't attach much blame to Ishan Kishan. Another googly from bowler, drew Kuldeep forward and took the edge. It hits Kishan on the thigh before deflecting past slip"
5645,"FOUR, he's done well to make the contact he's made. Floated up very wide, Curran reaches out and belts the flat-batted drive wide of long-off"
5646,"out Caught by Duminy!! Not quite to the pitch of the ball as he dances down, goes through with the loft nonetheless and lobs it off the inside half to long-on. Krunal gets on the wickets column as team lose their ninth. batsman c Duminy b bowler 18(17) [4s-3]"
5647,"out Lbw!! Kuldeep reviews a leg-before call, inadvertently extending team's misery by a couple of minutes. Went for a reverse-sweep and missed it by quite a bit. The ball pitched around middle and leg, straightened and would have knocked the stumps over comfortably. team go down to their eighth consecutive loss against team. batsman lbw b bowler 5(15)"
5648,"SIX, smashed! That has gone around 30 rows back. Back of a length and bowler had become predictable there, Lynn lined up for that length and muscled the pull over deep square leg. That came right off the screws"
5649,"FOUR, bowler has lost the plot a bit against Lynn. Goes short and at the body, no pace this time and Lynn is able to pick his spot, swivels around and places the pull backward of square. All along the ground"
5650,"SIX, not middled but batsman will take it. He loves facing the spinners. Bit of air given by Krunal and that is enough for batsman to get underneath it, sliced the on-drive over the wide long-on fence"
5651,"out Chris Lynn Run Out!! Yes-no and Lynn is gone. Massive wicket for Mumbai. Lynn was looking in good form and batsman has sold him down the river. Made room to punch the flatter delivery to cover-point, called for a single and took a couple of steps out, then said no and by that time Lynn was more than halfway down the wicket. All Suryakumar had to do was throw the ball to Krunal and he did the rest. Lynn is fuming as he walks back. Chris Lynn run out (Suryakumar Yadav/bowler) 21(15) [4s-3 6s-1]"
5652,"SIX, wow! batsman has had his problems against the short ball this season, not this time though. Picked the short of length delivery early, transfers his weight onto the back foot and nails the pull over deep square leg. Went a long way back into the stands"
5653,"FOUR, nice way to start the over. Rana gets a leg-stump half volley and he puts it away nonchalantly, leans forward and flicks it backward of square leg, fine leg was inside the ring and the man in the deep was square"
5654,"FOUR, bisected Ishan Kishan and wide slip to perfection. The off-cutter from Pandya and Rana read it early, waited back in his crease, opened the bat face and glided it right between the two fielders"
5655,"out Caught by Suryakumar Yadav!! bowler strikes in his first over. batsman scored a fifty in the reverse fixture but not today. And like the previous game, he falls to the leg-spinner. Backs away slightly to the leg-side, bowler pushed it through a bit and hence the slog sweep is not connected properly, hit it flat and straight to deep mid-wicket. Yadav did not have to move much to take that. batsman c Suryakumar Yadav b bowler 14(13) [6s-2]"
5656,"out Caught by Markande!! Is that the game? Small moments make such a big difference. Rana wanted the single off the previous ball, but Russell was not interested. Had he crossed over, then he would not have been on strike. Off-cutter outside off, Russell was backing away and expecting another short delivery, then has to reach out to play the lofted drive, doesn't get the elevation and offers a simple catch to Markande at extra cover. batsman c Markande b bowler 2(4)"
5657,"SIX, much needed maximum for team. They have lost the momentum completely. Flatter delivery and Rana is quick to kneel down and deposit it over deep mid-wicket. Not off the middle but enough to clear the fielder"
5658,"FOUR, smacked! batsman needs to get on with the game. Tossed up on off and middle, batsman bents his back knee and powers the sweep in front of square, splitting deep backward square and deep mid-wicket"
5659,"out Karthik Run Out!! Huge moment. The ball kissed the stumps but the LEDs didn't light up then, but it did when Hardik got his fingers to it with the ball still in contact with his forefinger. So the third umpire had a few replays and gave it in favour of Hardik. Very poor running this from team. Second run-out of the innings. Rana tapped the slower delivery towards backward point and took a few steps out, the ever eager Karthik was more than halfway down before being sent back, Duminy was the one who threw the ball and the rest as mentioned above. Karthik put in the dive but still was well short of the crease. Karthik run out (Duminy/bowler) 5(3) [4s-1]"
5660,"out Caught by Cutting!! That surely should be the game. Two in two for team. Fantastic catch from Cutting. Short delivery angled across the left-hander, Rana had to fetch the pull and all he could manage was a toe-end towards deep square leg, Cutting had to cover a lot of ground, he got there and slid across to complete the catch. He was out in similar fashion in the previous game as well. Problem area for Rana? batsman c Cutting b bowler 21(19) [4s-2 6s-1]"
5661,"FOUR, he's in sublime touch and couldn't have got off with a better shot. This was short and wide outside off, Suryakumar makes the most of the provided width and slaps it past the man at point. Was timed well and raced away to the fence in no time."
5662,"FOUR, batsman is going to play his shots. Premeditated and makes good contact. A powerful reverse-sweep and strikes cleanly. Got it over short third man and there is no one to stop that"
5663,no run. An lbw appeal against batsman and the umpire isn't interested. The fielding side decide to go up. Fair delivery. No bat. Pitched outside leg. No need to go further. Was a shortish ball that zipped through and Kishan missed the sweep after going down on a leg. Struck on the back thigh. Would have missed off too
5664,"FOUR, nicely done! Fullish ball, batsman gets down and paddle-sweeps it behind square leg"
5665,"FOUR, in the air, in the gap and that's batsman's third boundary in this over. Once again, bowler bowls one on the shorter side and Kishan went back to heave. Didn't quite get it off the middle, but the placement was right"
5666,"1 run, dropped! Nitish Rana is the culprit. That has to be taken at this level. batsman saw the line outside off and threw his bat hard at it. Sliced it over backward point and the ball went quickly to the fielder there. Rana could not hold on to it. How costly is that going to be?"
5667,"FOUR, glorious shot! Full and outside off, was probably overpitched and batsman pounced on it. Crouches low, reaches out and powerfully cracks it through extra cover. Raced away"
5668,"FOUR, edged and four! The Mumbai captain saw the width outside off and slashed his bat hard. Takes the edge and runs away to the third man fence"
5669,"FOUR, miscued pull and the lightning quick outfield ensures that it is a boundary. Got to feel for the bowler. Bowled two good balls and both have gone for fours. Banged it short and got good lift, cramped batsman for room. batsman, despite not being in a good position, went for the pull. Got decent wood and more importantly it went in the gap between deep mid-wicket and long-on"
5670,"FOUR, nothing wrong about this shot. Picked the short ball got early, gets into a strong position shuffling across and elevates it over backward square leg with his front foot off air. Pulled away!"
5671,"SIX, bad ball and he gets the treatment! Leg-break that pitches outside leg and turns towards the left-hander's pad. Kishan won't miss out. Gets down on a knee and nails the slog-sweep over backward square leg. Came down the track as well"
5672,"SIX, six more! This time goes over deep mid-wicket. This was flighted, Kishan stayed deep in the crease and mowed it powerfully over deep mid-wicket"
5673,"SIX, hat-trick of sixes. bowler was brave to toss the ball again. Danced down and bludgeoned it over long-on. 17-ball fifty for batsman! A superb knock from the southpaw"
5674,"SIX, make it four in a row! 25 off Kuldeep's over. The previous ball - he came down. Now, he stays deep in the crease. The ball is in his arc and he uses his wrists to whip it over cow corner"
5675,"SIX, oh my goodness! Even bowler won't be spared. High and handsome. Slightly fuller in length and Kishan sends another one into the deep mid-wicket stands. Down on his knees to clout it over deep mid-wicket"
5676,"out Caught by Uthappa!! End of an entertaining knock. Rohit knows the value of it. He pats Kishan's back as the latter walks off. Premeditated slog-sweep goes wrong this time, as he didn't generate sufficient power. He dragged it straight down Uthappa's throat at deep backward square leg. Takes just in front of the boundary rope. batsman c Uthappa b bowler 62(21) [4s-5 6s-6]"
5677,"1 run, direct-hit would have been curtains for batsman! Short of a length, Pandya cross-bats it to extra cover and he gave up as he was sprinting towards the other end. Chawla missed the target at the bowler's end and Pandya survives"
5678,"SIX, slogs and connects well. Moved off-side even before the ball was delivered and positioned himself for the big mow. The offie was in his slot and batsman clouted it over deep mid-wicket"
5679,"SIX, slower ball at 112.6kph, on a short of length. Pandya waits, clears the front leg and heaves it over deep mid-wicket"
5680,"SIX, one-handed six. Full toss wide of off, Pandya throws the kitchen sink and slices it behind square on the off-side. The bottom hand comes off the handle as well. But, he's got enough wood to collect a six there"
5681,out Caught by Rinku Singh!! batsman is caught at long-on. A full toss and Pandya went too hard at it. The bat turns at the point of impact. Easy catch for Rinku Singh. The umpires go upstairs to check if it's a no-ball. Just below the waist height. batsman c Rinku Singh b bowler 19(13) [6s-2]
5682,out Caught by Uthappa!! Maiden IPL wicket for bowler Krishna! Bowls the off-cutter at 113.4 and deceives the Mumbai captain. batsman was early to swing his bat - an attempt to loft downtown. The bat turns and the ball lobbed to long-off off the cue end. Uthappa ran back from mid-off to gobble that. batsman c Uthappa b bowler 36(31) [4s-2 6s-1]
5683,"SIX, this is why batsman is here! It was another slower delivery from Krishna, batsman walks across and uses the long levers to excellent effect. Powers the pull over deep mid-wicket"
5684,"SIX, long-on would have been interested, but he has to watch it sail over his head. Fullish ball on leg, batsman stands tall and bludgeons it over long-on"
5685,"SIX, back to back sixes. Darted at 117kph, on the shorter side as well, that's all too easy for batsman. Muscled the pull over deep mid-wicket"
5686,"FOUR, now a four. Another fast-paced delivery, batsman swings hard and makes good contact. Goes into the cow corner fence"
5687,out Caught by A Russell!! Russell takes a calm catch just in front of the boundary rope. The quick wrong 'un that zipped through and batsman gave a mighty heave. Doesn't get the required elevation and Dre Russ snaffles it at deep mid-wicket. batsman c A Russell b bowler 24(9) [4s-1 6s-3]
5688,"SIX, first one of the night. Was bowling so well before this delivery. Should have stuck to his lengths. Offers a juicy half-volley outside off and Suryakumar goes hard at it, swings hard and gets a thick outside edge that flies over third man. Not convincing enough for the batsman but he'll take that"
5689,"FOUR, cracking shot! Sweet sound on that blow. Full length delivery outside off, batsman doesn't miss out and crunches this one through the gap at cover. Was in the air for a while but no fielder was anywhere near"
5690,"FOUR, ahh, the form he is in! Lovely shot by Surya there. Was a length delivery outside off, Suryakumar waited for it and opened the face of the bat real late. Gets it past the man at wide slip to find the third man fence"
5691,"SIX, 22 off the final over! Third six of the over. Piyush bowler fires another one flat, batsman expected that. Stayed in his crease, stood tall and hammered it over deep mid-wicket"
5692,"FOUR, beats Russell's sprint. Another example of how quick this outfield is. Even the fastest runner in team couldn't reach anywhere close to this. Was a short delivery outside off, batsman was quick to rock back and crack it to the wide of long-off. That boundary will spoil bowler's over"
5693,"FOUR, wasn't middled. Pitched up on a full length outside off, batsman shuffles a bit and gives it all. Throws his bat at it and gets the outside edge beat the man at third man. No chance of stopping that"
5694,"FOUR, what a poor delivery to start off. Gifts a juicy full toss on middle and leg, Yadav gets down on his knee and sweeps it over square leg"
5695,"FOUR, this was even better. A full and tossed up delivery around off, Yadav strides forward and lofts it to perfection over extra-cover. His confidence is high and that shot will make him feel even better"
5696,"out Caught by Chris Lynn!! What an unlucky dismissal this for Evin batsman. Was a short delivery on leg, batsman tried to drag it away but got beaten and struck on the pads. The momentum of the bat was such that as the ball lobs after clipping the pads, it flicks the back of the willow and deflects towards short third man. Lynn is the man who takes it. batsman c Chris Lynn b bowler 18(13) [4s-3]"
5697,"FOUR, the boundaries from Suryakumar continue to flow. On the pads and the batsman does well to get down and sweep it sweetly to the fine leg fence"
5698,"out Caught by Rinku Singh!! Rohit Sharma is livid with this dismissal. The skipper thinks Surya should have carried on after getting off to such a good start. A short delivery around off, Suryakumar goes back in his crease and pulls it away. Fails to middle it though, not much power on that shot too. Easy forward catch for Rinku Singh at deep mid-wicket as the umpire signals time-out! batsman c Rinku Singh b bowler 36(32) [4s-5 6s-1]"
5699,"1 run, that could have been a soft dismissal. Was a tossed up delivery and batsman chipped it straight back. Kuldeep was quick to move to his left and put in the dive but the ball just eludes him"
5700,"SIX, that's a big one to get off the mark. Puts on his dancing shoes, gets to the pitch of the ball and deposits it over long-on for a massive six. Was middled and timed to perfection"
5701,"FOUR, uppish and just past the diving cover fielder! Dhawan tried but it was past him in a flash. Fullish ball and batsman was committed on the drive, doesn't bother to keep it down but the good thing was that he found the gap"
5702,"SIX, not quite his day, it seems. Conceded 15 runs in the first over, concedes a big one early in this one. Was a shortish delivery around off, Harshal was quick to camp back and deposit it over mid-wicket for a flat six"
5703,"FOUR, another poor delivery. He's struggling with his lines and lengths tonight. Bowls a short one again but on the pads, easy for the batsman to help it on its way to the square leg fence with an easy whip. No fielder anywhere close to cut this down"
5704,"FOUR, batsman is playing a gem here. Delhi need him to play a few of these. Flat and quick around off, batsman premeditates and reverse sweeps it through short third man. Was a well played shot by the southpaw"
5705,"FOUR, successive boundaries for batsman. This was full on middle and leg, batsman gets down and goes for a sweep, gets a glove to it and manages to evade short fine leg this time around"
5706,"FOUR, that's the third boundary of the over. batsman is showing no mercy against Rashid. Another short delivery down the leg side, batsman does well to drag it down to the long-leg fence. 15 runs of that over and batsman moves into the 40s"
5707,"SIX, now you know why he has been promoted up the order. Picks the length early on this short one and slaughters it over the long-on for an impressive six. Was middled to perfection as it went deep into the stands. Held the pose for the cameras too"
5708,"FOUR, easy pickings for the batsman. On the pads and can't get any easier for batsman who glances it past short fine. Needs one boundary more to reach his fifty"
5709,"1 run, 50-run stand up for the fourth wicket. How pivotal has this knock by the youngster been. Short of a length outside off and batsman does well to slap it to cover, a slight misfield too but the batsmen are satisfied with the single"
5710,out Harshal Patel Run Out!! 1 run completed. What is batsman doing? That's the second run-out he's involved in tonight. Flicks the flatter delivery to short mid-wicket and gets the single. Calls for the second too but as the throw comes in at the striker's end he sends Harshal back. Goswami fumbles on the first attempt - doesn't gather the ball cleanly - but reacts quickly and gets the direct hit right on the second one with an underhanded flick onto the stumps. Harshal Patel run out (Shikhar Dhawan/Goswami) 24(17) [6s-2]
5711,"SIX, smoked it! Tossed up delivery around off, batsman has smacked this one over the mid-wicket fence for half a dozen to reach his fifty."
5712,"FOUR, another impressive hit by batsman. Comes down the wicket, converts the length into a full one and hammers it past bowler. That raced away to the fence in no time"
5713,"SIX, Kaul keeps on getting thrashed, like he has throughout this innings. Dishes in a full length delivery on middle, batsman waits for it and pummels it over for long-on, high and handsome. The crowd absolutely loved it, they are up on their feet"
5714,"FOUR, he has all range of strokes in his kitty. Brings in the reverse sweep into play and gets it over the point fence on a couple of bounces"
5715,"SIX, bowler taken to cleaners. He has the Orange Cap now. A floated delivery around off, batsman goes after it with all might and clears the long-off fence"
5716,"SIX, even he gets punished. Tries to bowl a yorker but ends up bowling a half-volley. batsman doesn't miss out and deposits it over mid-wicket. Way into the stands as batsman moves on to 86*"
5717,"FOUR, on to 90* is batsman. On a length outside off, batsman throws his hands at it and smacks it over the cover fence, on a few bounces and into the fence"
5718,"FOUR, amazing shot that. Was a length ball outside off, batsman does well to ramp this over short third man. The ball is just flying all over the place, to all the corners. Awestruck by this display of batsmanship!"
5719,"FOUR, that's batsman's maiden century in the IPL. Has missed out on a few occasions previously but doesn't miss out tonight. Gets a full toss around off and makes sure to muscle it over mid-wicket with all his might. Gets to the milestone and celebrates in style. Maxwell gives him a tight hug!"
5720,"FOUR, first one of the night for batsman. Another full toss around off, batsman stays put and smacks it right past the bowler, intercepts long-off and long-on to perfection"
5721,"out Caught by Hales!! batsman looks to go big but misses. Was a back of a length delivery around off, batsman went at it with hard hands, swung at it only to get a top edge to wide long-off. Hales is the man who settles underneath and takes it. More importantly Pant is back on strike. batsman c Hales b bowler 9(8) [4s-1]"
5722,"FOUR, have run out of adjectives to describe this masterclass by batsman. Was a full length delivery around off, batsman gets into position early and scoops it over short third man with an angled bat"
5723,"FOUR, how easy? Similar to the previous shot. An exact replica. A fullish one around off, batsman is quick to get into position and scoop it over short third man once again"
5724,"SIX, don't think Bhuvi has been treated in such a way this season by anyone. He's under the pump! Bowls a short one around off, batsman transfers his weight on to the back foot and pulls it for a clean six over fine leg"
5725,"SIX, that's a one-handed six! Short of a length around off, batsman goes hard at it, in the process one hand comes off but he somehow manages to clear the long-on fence"
5726,"FOUR, smart batting! batsman has sussed the pitch and decides to go straight with his aggressive shots. Pays off instantly. A touch fuller from bowler and it's been launched straight over the bowler's head"
5727,"SIX, 26 runs off the final over as batsman ends on a scintillating 128*! Walks back to a standing ovation as he muscles the full toss over mid-wicket"
5728,"FOUR, excellent footwork from Shaw! This wasn't all that full but he came down the track in a flash and lofted it over bowler's head. Mid-on was a mere spectator. Top stroke! Not a bad ball at all, just a top shot"
5729,"out Caught by Dhawan!! bowler strikes! It's a huge wicket as well, that of the in-form batsman. This skid off the track from a good length and Shaw wanted to smash this over mid-wicket. Got it off the toe end and it spooned high up towards extra cover where there were a few fielders vying for it. Dhawan called for it and took the skier with glee before letting out his trademark slap on the knee. batsman c Dhawan b bowler 9(11) [4s-1]"
5730,"out Caught by Goswami!! 2 in 2 for bowler! This is an absolute jaffa that leaves batsman clueless. Drifted into him from a good length and spun away sharply to square him up. He tried to reach out but could only get a feather on it and Goswami was sharp to pouch it behind the stumps. Even if there wasn't an edge, batsman would have been stumped as he had got out of the crease in the bid to reach it. Excellent start for the Sunrisers. DD have been starting well of late but today, have been jolted early in the Powerplay. Alarm bells ringing for the hosts on this tricky surface. batsman c Goswami b bowler 11(13) [4s-2]"
5731,"FOUR, that's a typical batsman stroke! Back of a length and a bit of width on offer. He throws his hands to slam it on the up and finds the gap at cover as well. Raced away in a flash"
5732,"FOUR, does it again!' Squarer this time, result is the same. Short again from Kaul and more width on offer, he stands tall to force it away through backward point. Finds the gap once more. batsman is intent on taking it on"
5733,"FOUR, flashy runs this time but another boundary! Three in a row for batsman who isn't going to die wondering. Round the wicket from Kaul and angles this into the left-hander, it's a drive with hard hands and the edge flies past the diving Goswami to the fence"
5734,"out Shreyas Iyer Run Out!! Disaster for DD! For the second time in the tournament, batsman has ran Shreyas Iyer out due to some terrible running between the wickets. Waste of a wicket really and now, the Daredevils are in serious trouble. Another cutter and batsman got a thick inside edge onto the pad as the ball rolled to the left of an alert Goswami. Shreyas Iyer wanted the run and by the time it was denied, he was almost near a shakehand distance from batsman. Too late to go back and Goswami's throw is on the money to Sandeep who does the rest. Out by a countrymile. Shreyas Iyer run out (Goswami/bowler) 3(8)"
5735,"FOUR, back of a length ball and that's been swatted away. Rocks back, opens his stance and swivels a boundary through mid-wicket"
5736,"FOUR, back of a length but there's enough room outside off. batsman makes some of his own and punches it behind point. Softly done"
5737,"FOUR, that's no way soft. No way near to soft. Back of a length again and this time bowler angles it in. Umm, only for batsman to swivel and pull that round the corner. Used that incoming angle to his advantage, does batsman"
5738,"out Lbw!! You can see why bowler is pumped here. Was taken to the cleaners with two back-to-back fours and now comes up with a very full cutter, that skids on and raps batsman low on the pad. That was as out as the appeal suggested. batsman was as much beaten by the fullish length as he was by the slowness of the delivery. P-L-U-M-B. batsman lbw b bowler 14(10) [4s-3]"
5739,"SIX, that slow-and-wide plan to KW from bowler was better. Drifts this in and is slog-swept by KW over mid-wicket"
5740,"FOUR, now batsman was almost hoodwinked in the air. bowler saw him charging down and bowled it slow down leg. But batsman was upto it. Would have been stumped otherwise. Gets some bat and deflects it wide of the keeper"
5741,"FOUR, he's read this slower ball! gosh he has. Slow and short, batsman stays on the front foot as he mauls this over deep mid-wicket. Raises his bat to a fifty but we are left wanting for the pat-thigh-Mo'-twirl celebration"
5742,"SIX, hundred run stand. You have to ask batsman how he got under this full ball. Drifted in by bowler, and batsman's waited that extra second to nail that loft over long-on. A wristspinner from bowler that!"
5743,"SIX, strewn full and into the pads, and batsman's picked his area on this. Dispatches this over mid-wicket with a bat swing that suggests many more similar hits. He's hit the purple patch again, if this innings is any omen. 58 needed off last 7"
5744,"FOUR, there's no mercy in the world for things that're short. In cricket too. batsman rocks back and smashes the pull through square leg"
5745,"FOUR, is welcomed to the crease with a boundary. Kiwi to Kiwi and batsman greets him with a flick of his wrists to the fence and brings up his fifty as well. Superbly constructed knock from the team skipper, waves his bat to the dug-out. His 6th half-century of the season. It was too leg-sidish from bowler, batsman moved across and wristed it nonchalantly through square leg. In the gap!"
5746,"FOUR, bowler is not learning. Sprays another full ball and it ends up as a half-volley again. Drilled fluently square on the off-side"
5747,"1 run, run-out chance missed. KW had almost given up. Nothing going DD's way at the moment. Squeezed to point and they take on Iyer's throw, who misses the target at the non-striker's end"
5748,"SIX, another tripe ball on leg-stump line, it's half a dozen. Banged in short, on leg-stump. batsman swivels and helps it over disdainfully to fine leg. The ball lands on the ad cushions, the umpires took the confirmation of the third umpire before signalling it a six"
5749,"FOUR, this boundary brings the 150-run stand between the duo. Harmless length delivery outside off, no mercy whatsoever. batsman leans across and bashes it over extra cover"
5750,"FOUR, bowler ends his spell with a four. He has taken quite a beating today. Overpitches this time, batsman accepts the gift with glee and drills it through extra cover"
5751,"FOUR, batsman moves into the nineties. Short, aiming at the body. No problems for batsman, who gets into a strong position and pulls it witheringly through mid-wicket. No chance for the fielder in the deep"
5752,"FOUR, game, set and match - team. batsman finishes things off in style. Slanting on middle and leg, KW gets across and whips it over square leg to take team into the Playoffs. No-one in the deep and it'll be a boundary"
5753,"FOUR, bowler has bowled exactly like he didn't need to. Got it right first ball but not this time. Pacy ball wide of off, and batsman's scorched it away through point. Free swing of the arms and poof, the ball disappears"
5754,"FOUR, Harshal at square third man can't get to it. Played much finer by batsman this time, opening the bat face and slicing it just wide of the keeper. No pace lost here. bowler bowling them at over 140 clicks and batsman ensuring that they run to the fence as quick. Conservation of pace"
5755,"FOUR, length ball and a front-footed batsman mows it over mid-on. No shame in conceding a boundary to that"
5756,"SIX, gee, this cutter gets a treatment even worse. Drags it from outside off too -- meaning imagine the biceps he's built -- and then carts it over cow corner with a little bit of a crouch. Ungainly looking but effective"
5757,"FOUR, slowish leg break and that's a feeder to batsman's glory. Opens the punch and splits it between backward point and short third man. bowler isn't happy but pretty sure he wouldn't have been able to field it either. Pretty sure."
5758,"FOUR, over mid-off. And by a long way. Goes through the line and lofts it disdainfully there"
5759,"SIX, and this one's across the line. Shankar's angling it in, and that helps batsman's shot there. Swivels with the angle and plonks it all the way over deep square leg"
5760,"FOUR, ala laser beam. Ues his feet and drills that straight down the ground"
5761,"FOUR, he's gawked at bowler's release and read the slower delivery. Full too, so he's knelt and drilled that drive through extra cover"
5762,"FOUR, ""that's terrible, I am sorry,"" says Bishop on air. Another full slower delivery from bowler. He's not giving up on the plan. And batsman, not for the first time this over, creams the drive past the diving mid-off fielder"
5763,"FOUR, that is the form talking. Shimmies down and though he isn't close to the pitch of the ball, but still goes through with the loft over extra cover, one bounce and over the fence"
5764,"FOUR, batsman has decided to play his shots in the powerplay. The ball was come on nicely and that is the best time to score. Dances down and lofts it straight back over Ankit, Gowtham does well to get across from long-on and get a hand to it, but the ball still rolls into the ad cushions"
5765,"FOUR, freebie and batsman accepts it gleefully. Short and sliding down leg, batsman crouches low with a bent knee and sweeps it powerfully backward of square leg, split the two fielders there to collect his first boundary"
5766,"FOUR, that's nicely done. Goes back in the crease, picks the length early on the short one and helps it down to the fine leg fence. Short third tried hard to cut it down but it's a lightning quick outfield"
5767,"FOUR, edged but safe! So unlucky for the bowler. Bowls a pacy short delivery around off, batsman goes hard at it with a pull but a thick top edge eludes the keeper to find the fence"
5768,"out Caught by Buttler!! Quite similar to the previous delivery. Another short delivery around off, batsman goes for the pull once again, gets the top-edge too. But this time around it skies up towards short fine leg and Buttler has plenty of time to settle underneath and gulp it down. Second wicket of the match for Archer. Got Rayudu earlier, gets his opening partner now. batsman c Buttler b bowler 39(31) [4s-2 6s-2]"
5769,"1 run, another fifty for batsman. He continues to keep piling on runs against the Royals. This was a short delivery again and batsman helps it around the corner to reach his milestone. His job is not done yet though. Would be interesting to see how he deals with the spinners from here on"
5770,"out Caught by Binny!! The googly it is. Got away with earlier in the over but falls this time around. Was a googly around leg, batsman went for the sweep and got a top-edge. Binny at short fine leg somehow manages to hold on to the catch. That swirled in the air but Binny makes sure to not disappoint the leggie. batsman c Binny b bowler 52(35) [4s-6 6s-1]"
5771,"FOUR, that's an impressive drive. Only the second delivery he's facing, superb stuff. Fullish delivery, slower in pace too, batsman reads it well and creams his drive and gets it past wide mid-off"
5772,"SIX, finally! Too many slower deliveries, one had to go big. batsman picks it up nicely and deposits it well over the mid-wicket fence. First one of the night for MS"
5773,"no run, that was smacked hard by batsman. Middled his shot but hit the stumps at the bowler's end. Billings wanted the run but bowler was quick to gather the ball and uproot the stumps with the ball in his hand. Billings was out of the crease for while but makes sure to get back in time"
5774,"FOUR, no he doesn't. Was a good delivery fired into the blockhole, batsman went after it with a huge swing, got an inside edge, past the stumps and past short fine leg to meet the fence"
5775,"FOUR, boundaries in succession. batsman finally gets one right. bowler bowled a shortish delivery and his team mate did well to connect his pull, beats the diving fielder at deep square leg"
5776,"FOUR, a cracking boundary to bring up the 50-run stand. Moves away, picks the length on the fuller one and lofts it well over mid-off"
5777,"2 runs, dropped! Chopra puts one down on his IPL debut. This was whipped to deep square leg by batsman, Chopra came running in, got his hands to it but failed to hold on to it."
5778,out batsman Run Out!! A direct-hit by Buttler and batsman has to depart. He failed to dig out the yorker and tried to sneak in a bye. Before he could turn back and get into the crease Buttler had done his job. The batsman had given up! batsman run out (Buttler) 27(22) [4s-3]
5779,"out Bowled!! Dragged on! First ball wicket for Archer. And it is the dangerous batsman who has been sent back. He lets out an ooh as he sees the stumps disturbed. Back of a length delivery outside off, batsman stays leg-side of the ball to carve it through off, but the slow nature of the surface does not get the ball quickly to him and hence the inside edge onto the stumps. Much needed wicket for team. batsman b bowler 12(9) [4s-2]"
5780,"FOUR, batsman opens his account with an elegant flick. Archer goes round the wicket and fires in a full delivery, angled into the left-hander and batsman whips it past the man at short square leg. Raced away to the fence"
5781,"FOUR, batsman makes the most of the free-hit. Archer is not impressed. Very full and outside off, batsman bends down and uses the pace of the bowler to squeeze it behind point. No chance for third man to cut that off"
5782,"FOUR, fraction short and batsman is quick to make bowler pay, he goes back and punches it square on the off-side, he used the pace of bowler to beat the fielder at point"
5783,"FOUR, top shot! This is batsman at his best. The slider which skids on from a fullish length, batsman makes room, exposes his stumps and drives it inside out through the packed off-side field"
5784,"FOUR, that is a horrible delivery from bowler. Tried the slower short of length delivery, sat up nicely in the surface, batsman had all the time to pick his spot and he muscled it over mid-wicket, for a one bounce four"
5785,"SIX, there's the release shot. He's been looking for it for quite some time. Fraction short and that is all batsman needed, quickly moves back in the crease and smashes the pull a long way into the deep mid-wicket stand"
5786,"SIX, this over compensates for the previous two overs. batsman gets into the act. It was the googly and batsman was hitting it against the turn, but still had enough to clear the wide long-on fence"
5787,"1 run, run-out missed. batsman was a goner. Backs away to leg and is made to reach out to his slower short of length delivery, chops the cut towards cover and sets off, Rahane had one stump to aim and he misses. batsman was gone by a fair distance there"
5788,"SIX, wow! batsman starting to unleash. bowler goes round the wicket and bowls the back of a length delivery, right in batsman's arc and he has no half measures as he deposits it into the deep mid-wicket stand"
5789,"FOUR, that's a gimme! No room for error when you are bowling to Jos batsman. He likes it short and gets some width to work too, just stands back and stabs the ball through the off-side ring"
5790,"FOUR, we have seen this in the last game! Anything short and batsman will pounce on it. Gets another back of a length dart wide of off-stump, he transfers his weight onto the back foot and drills it wide of mid-off"
5791,"FOUR, brilliant hand-eye co-ordination. bowler continues to bowl short and wide, batsman set himself up early on this occasion, raced away off the sweet spot behind point"
5792,"FOUR, drifts on batsman's pads and gets picked away, wasn't a controlled shot that, but batsman made enough contact off the bat to send it fine past the keeper"
5793,"FOUR, reverse slap. batsman is not hanging back. Makes his intentions clear, sees the ball outside off and times the pants of it, got it in the gap too. Just behind backward point"
5794,"SIX, halfvolley, dispatched! Loads it up full and bowls straight, batsman uses those long levers to smack the life out of that leather. All the way over long-on"
5795,"FOUR, really lucky for batsman. Pressure was building on him, he makes some room and slices this up off a thick edge over short third man. The idea was to go over backward point, but it spooned up over Bhajji off the edge"
5796,"out batsman Run Out!! Oh dear, total breakdown between the two batsmen, so much so that they were almost caught together at one end at one point. Back of length delivery, batsman pats it towards backward point and takes a couple of steps down the pitch, which lured Buttler for the single. However, batsman was guilty of ball-watching and quickly turned his back to him, while Buttler ran through to the striker's end. Eventually, batsman may have sacrificed himself. Raina passes the ball onto Bravo who under-arms it back onto the stumps to catch the struggling batsman short. batsman run out (Raina/bowler) 21(22) [4s-2]"
5797,"FOUR, beautiful timing. That sped off his bat through backward point. Back of length just outside off, not that bad a delivery, but batsman leans back and spears a cut through to the fence"
5798,"FOUR, full at the pads, batsman gets his bat down from the big back-lift and flicks it stylishly behind square. Beats the fielder's dive in the deep"
5799,"out Caught by Dwayne Bravo!! The big back-lift probably works to his detriment here. Full at the pads again, the ball slightly stops on him, but due to the velocity at which the bat comes down, he's unable to check the flick shot enough. Chips it off a soft leading edge straight to short mid-wicket. batsman c Dwayne Bravo b bowler 8(6) [4s-2]"
5800,"FOUR, throws his hands at the width on offer and lashes it through backward point. Two ordinary deliveries from Thakur back-to-back. Not good"
5801,"1 run, clears his front leg and smacks this slower ball straight at bowler, who tried putting his hands together in front of his face but it burst through them. Half a chance, if you want to be harsh"
5802,"FOUR, audacious from batsman, but then that's what he is about. Slower length ball, he gets into position early and slaps the reverse-hit through backward point. Much needed boundary off the over"
5803,"FOUR, oh well well. Where is sweeper cover? The fielder was very square in his position, and batsman made some room to slap the ball away from off-stump. Brilliant batting. But was that the plan or did the fielder stand out of place. bowler shakes his head as he walks back"
5804,"SIX, length ball from Bravo, disappears. What a blow from batsman. His base was steady as he launched it brutally over long-on"
5805,"out Caught by Watson!! Full toss at the stumps, should have disappeared too. Instead, Bravo's got very lucky. batsman swung across it too early, and lobbed it up off a leading edge. No mistake from Watson at extra cover, with his hands like buckets. batsman c Watson b bowler 22(17) [4s-1 6s-1]"
5806,"1 run, dropped by Dhoni. Could have been the match right there. Fine leg is inside the ring, which tempts batsman into looking for the scoop. But this is a slower ball, making it really difficult to get any leverage on it. He deflects it to Dhoni's left, who dives with one hand but can't cling on"
5807,"SIX, stunning strike from Krishnappa batsman, that too off his very first ball. The crowds jump out of their seats as he muscles his flat-batted heave over long-off. It's gone soaring into the stands"
5808,"SIX, this is remarkable from batsman. He's come out and nailed two balls out of the three he's faced. bowler misses his mark with the yorker, offers it in the slot and batsman tonks it over long-off's head"
5809,"out Caught by Dhoni!! Back of length outside off, width on offer, batsman slashes at it but only gets an edge through to Dhoni. Precious little cameo though. It's got the equation down to 12 off the final over. batsman c Dhoni b bowler 13(4) [6s-2]"
5810,"SIX, the Rajasthan dugout erupts. Back of length slower ball, not easy to hit, but batsman hacks it with stunning power over mid-wicket. Wow what a shot. This should be the blow which seals it"
5811,"FOUR, this is batting of the highest class from Jos batsman! Steps outside leg to create room and lifts it nonchalantly over extra cover. The timing on that takes cares of the rest"
5812,"FOUR, that's so effortlessly done! So, its a short ball on middle, batsman jumps back to create that extra leeway on the leg-side, spots the ball and punches it crisply through mid-wicket. Easy peasy"
5813,"FOUR, makes room once again and swings wildly, the drift picks the thick inside edge and runs fine of the keeper to his right"
5814,"SIX, nothing wild about this one, sets himself on one knee and launches Bhajji for a many-a-mile over mid-wicket. Clean as a whistle"
5815,"out Bowled!! batsman is livid, yells out all the frustration after he missed the shot. Looks to charge at the bowler and exposes his cards way too early in the process, Bhajji fires it in quickly to defeat batsman's bat swing and hit the middle of middle. batsman b bowler 11(7) [4s-1 6s-1]"
5816,"FOUR, dragged short and drifting down, batsman clears his front leg and helps it away through backward square"
5817,"out Caught by Raina!! Spin, spin and spin. Ah, this is going to be some contest. Jaddu gets enough rip off the pitch, lands it around the ideal length and gets some purchase off the surface, hits the seam and turns just enough to kiss the outside edge. Raina at first slip has bucket hands, he doesn't miss many, does he? batsman was caught in two minds there, wasn't fully forward neither back, just hung in there and poked at it. Late spot: The ball deflected off Dhoni's glove before it lobbed up to Raina. batsman c Raina b bowler 4(3) [4s-1]"
5818,"FOUR, batsman's game keeps getting better and better! Employs one of the best tactics to play spin. Gets down on one knee and swats the reverse sweep from outside off, right in the gap behind point, sweeper cover can't get there"
5819,"2 runs, straighter one, batsman paddles it fine to bring up his fourth successive fifty to match Virat Kohli's feat. Only Viru has five in a row"
5820,"FOUR, spins away from a shorter length, batsman goes hard and sends a thick edge fine of third man. Streaky, but batsman won't mind"
5821,"FOUR, that's a gift. Full and down leg, batsman glances it off his pads and off she goes..."
5822,"FOUR, how lucky is Lynn? This could have easily chopped on. Short and wide outside off, Lynn plays it with hard hands and gets an inside edge that goes past the stumps and all way to the fine leg fence"
5823,"FOUR, replica of the previous delivery. Believe in luck? Another short delivery outside off, Lynn goes after it and gets an inside edge, past the stumps again to meet the fine leg boundary in succession."
5824,"1 run, a direct hit there and it was curtains for Narine. He was nowhere in the frame and had given up. Short of a length around off, batsman chops it to short third man, calls for a single and completes it. Mohit Sharma is the one who fails to score the direct hit"
5825,"SIX, how good is his bat? Or is the ground? Whatever it is, six runs in batsman's account. Was a slower delivery on middle and leg, batsman waited for it and flicked it over mid-wicket. High, handsome and just over the fence"
5826,"FOUR, carnage! Haven't seen a better knock from him. Was a full toss and batsman made sure to time his flick through mid-wicket. team chants in the crowd as the batsmen are showing no mercy"
5827,"SIX, unstoppable! Shortish delivery around off, batsman camps back and pulls it over the mid-wicket fence. The fielder near the fence watches it sail over him. Has been the story of the match so far..."
5828,"FOUR, full and wide outside off, batsman stands tall and pumps it over cover. One bounce and into the fence. Running out of adjectives here"
5829,"out Caught by Rahul!! Tye gets the second wicket too. Bowls a short delivery around off, batsman tries to pull that away but ends up getting a top edge. Easy take for Rahul to hold on. It's Andre Russell who walks out to bat at batsman's fall. Was such an entertaining knock by the all-rounder. Has left the Kings stunned and speechless. batsman c Rahul b bowler 75(36) [4s-9 6s-4]"
5830,out Caught by Mohit Sharma!! Double strike in the same over for Tye. This spell might help the Kings to get back in the game. Was a fullish delivery outside off but batsman got deceived due to the slower one. He reaches for it and ends up slicing it to Mohit Sharma at backward point. Has been the story of the season for batsman. Has got his eye in and thrown it away more often than not. batsman c Mohit Sharma b bowler 24(17) [4s-2 6s-1]
5831,"FOUR, played, well played DK! This was a flighted delivery and batsman played with an angled bat to pierce the gap on the off-side. Gets it past short third man and the timing was such that it races away to the fence"
5832,"FOUR, edged away! If there was a slip, this could have been a catch. An easy one. batsman went back in his crease to cut it but got an outside edge, through the empty slip cordon to find the third man boundary"
5833,"SIX, woah, that's a biggie. And someone's caught it in the top tier. Massive swing of the bat by Russell. Clears the front leg and swipes to glory over cow corner"
5834,"FOUR, swept from in front of off-stump and Tye's lazy at the deep square leg ropes. Doesn't bend down enough as he picks it one-handed"
5835,"SIX, that's an okay slog-sweep. Stretches far in front, picking it from an off-stump line and swamping it over backward square leg"
5836,"SIX, we need a replacement ball. You know why? This one's on the roof. An uncouth slog that pays off this time. Half-crouched, front leg outta way and hocus pocus - that's sailing over deep mid-wicket. 19 runs off the over"
5837,"SIX, team right now are an efficient courier service, sending everything into the crowd. Angled in, batsman played with it, slogging it over deep mid-wicket"
5838,"FOUR, that's the front of the hand cutter kinda delivery. Slow off the deck and bouncing, and batsman got a top-edge as he looked to swat it leg-side. Wide of the keeper and it runs away, deflecting off KL's helmet"
5839,"SIX, gets into the position early. Stays in the crease and dispatches this carom ball through square leg. Wafting it across"
5840,"FOUR, it's gone a little wrong for bowler this over. Overcooks the googly down the leg-side and Russell's helped him through short fine leg for a boundary. A 19-run over followed by a 21-run over"
5841,"SIX, how nicely has that been played. That's a slower short ball but batsman steps out and loops the pull over his shoulders. Just helped the ball there to the fine leg fence"
5842,"FOUR, squeezed away over Gayle at short third man. Wide yorker length delivery, Russell threw his hands at it and popped it over the fielder. Very deliberate, with the open bat face"
5843,"out Caught by Rahul!! He's finally picked him with a seam-up back of a length ball. Russell preps for a big swing over mid-wicket but doesn't get hold of the ball. Miscued high in the air, and back, and Rahul takes care of the steepler with a little swirl. batsman c Rahul b bowler 31(14) [4s-2 6s-3]"
5844,"SIX, cameras pan to Mohit's face and he's clueless at the monstrosity of his home venue. Slow ball angles across, but batsman's dispatched him over deep mid-wicket first ball. Is there a pitch in the pavilion?"
5845,"FOUR, Miller's jump at long-off isn't good enough. This was barelled away by batsman. Absolutely brutal. Gets a fullish delivery and he got under it, pumping it with a straight 45-degree bat for a hit in the V. Now who doesn't like it"
5846,"out Caught by (sub)Miller!! That was a wide.. had batsman left it. But he doesn't. Goes after the slower ball, slices it up in the air, and Miller comes in a few yards from long-off to catch it. batsman c (sub)Miller b bowler 11(4) [4s-1 6s-1]"
5847,"FOUR, switches his stance open and reverse-pulls that to the third man fence. Cricket in modern times is truly ridiculous. And fun"
5848,"FOUR, Gayle's fielding in boots so heavy that it doesn't allow him to move. Standing at short third man, intending to field this outside edge from batsman, but his feet don't move. And he surrenders to his constraints"
5849,"1 run, inches short of a yorker and he's squeezed it out to backward point. batsman's 15th IPL fifty - and his first this season"
5850,"out Caught by (sub)Miller!! He's done two things wrong here: a) gone against the angle on this slow short ball from over the wicket, and b) played the slog-pull off the front foot. Misuced to Miller at long-on but he's done his job, has batsman. batsman c (sub)Miller b bowler 50(23) [4s-5 6s-3]"
5851,"FOUR, played the slower ball at 93ks brilliantly here. Waits and pulls, splitting the two fielders in deep square on the leg-side"
5852,"FOUR, tries to bowl the pacy full-wide ball from over the wicket but batsman's reached out and ushered it to the ropes off the toe-end. Through to square third man"
5853,"SIX, his first ball in the match has sailed over long-on. wow. Full and swung away. team finish with whoppin' 245"
5854,"no run, dropped! That was a tough chance as it was struck hard by batsman. bowler hardly had any time to react there. Got his right hand to it but failed to cling on. He's in some pain, in fact he's going off the field. How costly a blow will that be for Kings XI? He has been one of their best bowlers this season."
5855,"SIX, finally connects. Was trying since quite some time. Receives a short delivery and batsman makes sure to camp back and heave it over the mid-wicket fence. Clean as a whistle!"
5856,"FOUR, bowler goes full this time. Tossed up delivery around middle, batsman clears his front leg and smacks this one over mid-on. The fielder there tried all that he could with a leap but the ball eluded him with ease"
5857,"SIX, this is massive, out of the park. Literally. Bowls a slower delivery to start off, Lynn picks it early, gets into position and smokes it over mid-wicket, over the roof and six runs for the big man"
5858,"FOUR, up and over! Shortish delivery, bowled at express speed. batsman goes after it with a swing and gets an outside edge. Beats short third man and finds the fence on one bounce"
5859,"FOUR, boundaries continue to flow as batsman continues to take them on. This was a full length delivery and batsman manages to heave it over mid-on. Expensive first over by Sran!"
5860,"SIX, even the Purple Cap holder hasn't been spared. Stands tall and towers the length ball over long-on to welcome Tye into the attack"
5861,"out Bowled!! Lynn finally runs out of luck. Got lucky on quite a few occasions earlier but not this time. This was a short one around leg, he tried to pull it away but the ball clips his thigh, then it deflects off his glove to disturb the stump. He has given the start team required though. batsman b bowler 27(17) [4s-2 6s-2]"
5862,"FOUR, batsman keeps marching on. Wickets won't make any difference to him, he'll play like he always does. This was a short delivery aimed at the hips and all batsman had to do is help it on its way. Manages to do so and beats short fine leg"
5863,"SIX, excellent shot! Moves inside the line, swings hard and towers it right over the bowler's head for a maximum. He's looking in good touch today"
5864,"FOUR, there's no stopping him. Walks down the wicket and chips the widish delivery over cover. Long-off sprints across to stop it but the ball wins the race"
5865,"FOUR, successive boundaries! Goes straight this time, smacks the tossed up delivery hard and beats the fielder at long-on this time around"
5866,"FOUR, first one of the innings for Robbie. Stays put and times his loft right over the bowler's head. The man in the deep was a bit wide and even if he was fine, wouldn't be able to stop it"
5867,"1 run, third fifty for batsman in IPL and second one this season. Nudges the floater away to deep mid-wicket to reach his milestone. But he needs to carry on. Usually throws it away after reaching fifty"
5868,"FOUR, pulled away! Shortish on the pads and batsman goes back in the crease to pull it past deep square leg. Striking at a rate of over 200 at the moment"
5869,"FOUR, Gayle has given up! As soon as this was swept. Was the leg spinner around the leg stump and batsman did well to elude Gayle at short fine leg"
5870,"SIX, that's the second 50-run stand of this match. team showing some intent. This was slogged over the mid-wicket fence by batsman to perfection"
5871,"SIX, that's meditative. Pure timing. Uses his feet and times this carom ball over long-off"
5872,"SIX, again shimmying down and going inside-out with this loft over cover. Got right to the pitch and under it. KL batsman's good. Real good"
5873,"FOUR, 137ks and on a back of a length, batsman looked a little cramped for the glide to third man and squeezed it out off the splice. Wide of the lone slipper"
5874,"FOUR, good use of the feet. batsman puts on the dancing shoes and gets close to the flighted delivery, then muscles the drive straight of long-on, where Russell's dive is an after thought"
5875,"SIX, now sends it over Russell. Not connected properly, but the small boundaries aid him in. Shuffled across to the conventional chinaman and heaved it with a bent back knee over long-on, just over"
5876,"out Caught by Searles!! Wicket for Kuldeep. That should get back his confidence, especially after what Ishan Kishan did in the previous game. Switched to round the wicket and fired the full delivery outside off, batsman moved a bit and lofted it to long-off. The length was tad too full and hence batsman could not get underneath it. A well-judged catch by Searles, who timed his jump to perfection. batsman c Searles b bowler 19(11) [4s-2 6s-1]"
5877,"SIX, half tracker and batsman dismisses it from his presence. Real poor bowling from Kuldeep. Gave batsman all the time to pick his spot and muscle the pull over the cow corner fence"
5878,"SIX, consecutive sixes for batsman. He needs to kick-on, at least to get his form back. Wrong 'un and batsman had to fetch it from outside off, cue-ends the slog sweep just over a leaping Searles at long-on"
5879,"FOUR, similar to the previous delivery and this time batsman uses the pace on the ball smartly, waits and back cuts it behind point, bisected the two fielders there to perfection"
5880,"SIX, batsman is not given up yet. Length delivery right in the slot, batsman winds up with the front leg cleared and gives it his all, heaved away into the deep mid-wicket stand"
5881,"out Caught by Kuldeep Yadav!! And he's gone.. batsman is livid. Lets out a grunt before storming off. bowler went round the wicket and hurled it across the right-hander, batsman shuffled across and did well to get under the ball to play the scoop, couldn't find the elevation and Kuldeep takes a good catch at short fine. Either side and that would have been a boundary. FYI, maiden IPL wicket for bowler. batsman c Kuldeep Yadav b bowler 34(20) [6s-3]"
5882,"SIX, off the mark in style. Tye does not want to hang around. Back of a length and not much wrong with the delivery, Tye just goes through the line and smashes it over the leaping long-on fielder"
5883,"SIX, third six of the over. This time off batsman's willow. bowler hurls it full and in the swinging arc, batsman presses forward and sends it sailing over long-off. bowler ends with 4-0-52-1 on IPL debut"
5884,"FOUR, delicate. The quicker offie and batsman picked it alright, camped back in the crease and used the pace on the ball to direct it fine past short third man"
5885,"FOUR, now shows his power. bowler offers him the space to free his arms and batsman thumps it straight back over Tye, no chance for long-on to get across and stop that"
5886,"FOUR, length delivery and Tye gives it his all, shuffled across to get inside the line and powered it away along the ground to deep mid-wicket, no chance for Gill to get around"
5887,"SIX, wow! That is a massive hit from Ash. Picked the back of the hand slower ball, lined himself up for the big heave-ho and gave it the full monty, cleared long-on quite comfortably"
5888,"SIX, batsman is helping his team's Nteam with these strikes. Back of a length and at the stumps, batsman cleared his front leg and hammered it over cow corner. Got the elevation and the distance"
5889,"FOUR, team are in this mathematically. 38 off 7. batsman is playing a gem here. Short delivery and batsman cheekily periscopes his bat up and ramps it over DK. It almost went the distance"
5890,"out Caught by Karthik!! Excellent take! Sharp short delivery on middle and leg, Tye moved across, got inside the line and attempted the pull, the pace was just too quick for him, kissed the glove and flew to the left of DK, who flings full length to glove that. batsman c Karthik b bowler 14(10) [4s-1 6s-1]"
5891,"out Lbw!! Ouch! batsman is limping off the field. DK helped his state mate compose himself. He was struck on the right knee. Length delivery right on the stumps, batsman with a cleared front leg missed the slog to the on-side, hit flush on the back knee in front of middle. The umpire took a while before raising his finger, but he made the right decision. batsman grunted in pain after the blow and was on his haunches for a bit. batsman lbw b bowler 45(22) [4s-4 6s-3]"
5892,"FOUR, fuller and outside off, a handsome square drive to get off the mark from Mohit, he presses forward and creams it with an open bat face square of the wicket, giving sweeper no chance"
5893,"FOUR, this is why the first ball to batsman was into the batsman. A bit of width and batsman's found the room to slash it disembowelingly wide of backward point"
5894,"FOUR, switches to round the wicket to batsman, who's laid into this room offered outside off. Cracks it with a slash over third man"
5895,"FOUR, action-reaction law? batsman rubbished it. Hits it harder than it arrives. Full, he's drilled it off the toe-end and you had to look at Russell and the umpire ducking to save their lives"
5896,"1 run, dropped by Karthik. A leading edge kinda top-edge there as batsman looked to run it into the leg-side. Looped behind, DK leaped but deflected it off the tip of his gloves. A bit high that but it'll be recorded as a drop"
5897,"SIX, 143ks and that's why it's rushed away to the third man fence. Full and wide, batsman made some room and carved it away with disdain"
5898,"1 run, 50 up. Length ball at 143ks, worked effortlessly through mid-wicket"
5899,"SIX, that isn't for aspiring fast bowlers. Look away! batsman backs way and pummels this pull off the front foot. Over deep mid-wicket without any fuss"
5900,"out Caught by Karthik!! He had to fall to a short ball, didn't he? Fast bowling mostly wins. Got his front leg outta way to similarly hack the ball open-stanced over square leg -- like he had done first ball of this over -- but he's in a horrible shape, is batsman. Gets a top-edge that carries nicely to Karthik behind the stumps. batsman c Karthik b bowler 21(17) [4s-2 6s-1]"
5901,"out Caught by Searles!! Mayank falls for a first-ball duck, and gets Russell on a hat-trick. Another short ball does the trick. He's pulling a short ball that's climbing at him off the front foot. Gee, that deserves to be punished with a wicket. They're checking Russell's front foot, but he's landed well behind the line. You'll have to question the on-field umpiring here. Oh wait, I'm told that they also checked for the second bouncer for the over, and Russell was okay there too. batsman c Searles b bowler 0(1)"
5902,"SIX, stand and deliver. Pings the sightscreen. bowler errs by going full and it is right in batsman's arc, he latches onto it and dismisses it straight back over bowler"
5903,"SIX, fifty for batsman. A thumbs up to his partner followed by a bat wave to the crowd. Third on the trot for him. He's to continue if team have to win this. Shuffled a bit in his crease before making room to this short delivery, upper cuts it into the second tier over third man. Also gets the orange cap back"
5904,"out Caught by Prasidh!! Dre Russ doing all the damage for team. Third wicket for him. The off-cutter on a length, batsman spots it early and goes through with the lofted on-drive, seemed to have struck it enough before Krishna came into the frame, ran to his left from long-on, went with two hands over his head, but the ball got stuck in his left hand. Lucky! But that will do. batsman c Prasidh b bowler 3(6)"
5905,"SIX, that's outta here. Third time the ball has been smashed out of the stadium today. batsman once again picks what bowler is bowling, runs down the wicket and gets close to the ball, lofts it handsomely over long-on and out of the ground"
5906,"SIX, bowler being taken to the cleaners. That is the fourth six batsman has struck off bowler. Half tracker on leg-stump, batsman transfers his weight back and deposits the pull over deep backward square leg"
5907,"out Bowled!! bowler has his man. Big moment in the game. That might be the match. Even bowler enjoyed out. He lets out a roar. Never seen him express his delight after picking a wicket. The round the wicket ploy has worked, carrom ball on the stumps, batsman kneels to play the slog sweep, gets an inside edge onto the front thigh, the backspin on the ball takes it onto the stumps. Unfortunate way to get out. batsman b bowler 66(29) [4s-2 6s-7]"
5908,"FOUR, crunched! 100 comes up within 10 overs and team still need to strike over 14 per over. On a length and outside off, batsman stands and thumps it on the up past Russell at extra cover. Raced away!"
5909,"out Bowled!! What a rippah! bowler shows who's the boss here. Imparts loads of revs on this and gets the ball to straighten at a rapid pace to bamboozle the 18-year old. batsman clearly didn't pick that. Was standing languidly on the back foot hoping to milk that across the line, wasn't to be. Pegs are back... batsman b bowler 2(4)"
5910,"SIX, this is what batsman can do? Such a brute of a player. It's a sit-up outside off, begging to be smashed; batsman nonchalantly pulls it into the stands over mid-wicket. Simple ain't it?"
5911,"FOUR, tad full and that's all batsman needed. Transfers his weight onto the back foot to cream the punchy-drive through covers. No-one moved"
5912,"FOUR, nice use of the pace from batsman, sits back in the crease and opens the bat face at the right moment to send it fine of third man"
5913,"SIX, into the stands! Premeditated hack and he's got all of it. Nicely floated up by Mo Ali and the next thing he sees is the ball sailing into the mid-wicket stands"
5914,"SIX, fuller and wider, batsman frees his arms and lays into it, sends bowler for a 83-metre maximum over long-on. He's striking the ball clean as ever is Rishabh batsman, just one short of his fifty now"
5915,"FOUR, 7th IPL fifty for Rishabh batsman! The DD dug out is up and applauding this wondrous talent. Slightly short and he's laced all the power into the pull shot, raced away behind square"
5916,"FOUR, that's a one-handed hoick. Saw the line (drifting down leg) and swiped it as hard as he can, no-one there at fine leg. Great placement"
5917,out Caught by de Villiers!! That's a sliding specky from AB. Makes up for the catch he dropped earlier. batsman went for his go-to shot - agricultural slog - and couldn't quite manage it off the middle. Flew off the bottom hand to the left of long-on where AB covered great distance to slide and gobble it before tripping over with a tumble. All of that inches inside the rope. It certainly needed some brilliance to end batsman's blitzkrieg. batsman c de Villiers b bowler 61(34) [4s-5 6s-4]
5918,"FOUR, oh dear. With nobody at fine leg, Yadav for some strange reason decides to feed the ribs. Shankar swivels, pulls, one-legged. And his strike-rate's up to decency"
5919,"out Caught by Kohli!! No, no. None of his late antics tonight. The innings was always painful .. to play, to watch. And it ends painfully. It's quick from bowler, zipping in a little too straight. But Iyer decides to swing him over cow corner. Barely connects, gets the elevation. And Kohli's waiting. batsman c Kohli b bowler 32(35) [4s-3]"
5920,"FOUR, oh the swagger. It's supposedly his first ball in the IPL and he starts off in all glory. A juicy pitch up, he gets under, flows through the line and lofts it over mid-off. Well over"
5921,"FOUR, on the dance down, flings his hands out and slices. Can't keep it down. And Siraj running in from third man can't keep it in. Misjudges his dive"
5922,"SIX, oh yes. That's off the middle alright. bowler tries the sucker full ball to follow. And Abhishek tonks it straight down, full flow, full elegance, full pose. And to imagine he's 17"
5923,"SIX, some more. bowler loses his line, ends up too straight and finds it swatted. Hard, flat, cow corner"
5924,"SIX, he's toying here. And from Pant's brutal attack, it's come down to Abhishek's delicacy. bowler threatens him with a bouncer, it's off target, it's with width and he carves/upper-cuts it over a vacant third man"
5925,"FOUR, and now Shankar rubs it in. He's playing second fiddle mind you, but he's got enough punch lines with himself. Another horrific delivery, down leg, all it needs is a tickle and Shankar gives it a glance instead. Save your legs"
5926,"SIX, he's lighting it up. Gets the front leg out, loads up, from that massive backlift as he hoicks. Meaty. Long-on. Murder"
5927,"FOUR, and now save your heads. bowler dishes out friendly length at this stage, Abhishek gets under and puts all his muscle in drilling it straight back. Everyone in the firing line .. and everyone can only jump out. Boundary + the 50-run stand"
5928,"out Bowled!! bowler is doing what he's been asked to. Bowls the wrong 'un and catches batsman by surprise; no clue. Knocked him over. batsman was prodding forward to drive, thought it was a conventional legbreak, wasn't to be. The ball lands on a good length and snakes in viciously to sneak through the bat-pad gate. team couldn't have asked for a better start. batsman b bowler 12(9) [4s-1 6s-1]"
5929,"FOUR, googly again, Iyer picks it out of the hand, had enough time to pick his spot; just backs away and stabs the ball behind point. Raced away..."
5930,"FOUR, short and smashed! batsman picked the length early there, the line was there to help him too. Just swivels and belts the pull backwards of square leg"
5931,"FOUR, short and no sparing this. batsman gets into good position to maul this pull through mid-wicket, gee! He's hit that with some power"
5932,"FOUR, width on the other side this time, batsman frees his arms and thrashes it over extra cover"
5933,"SIX, get outta here, Rishabh batsman's bat screamed with delight. Saw the length (short) early and launched this flat over mid-wicket at the rate of knots. Phewfff!"
5934,"SIX, he is constantly feeding to batsman's strengths. That ball sat up nicely outside off, batsman uses all his bottom hand power to hammer it straight of long-off. All the way"
5935,"1 run, 50 partnership! Gets there with a flick off the pads to short fine"
5936,"FOUR, that's a friendly dart outside off stump, Iyer makes use of the width on offer and glides late with an angled bat wide of short third"
5937,"1 run, slapped back. Would have been a brilliant reaction catch from bowler. Sticks his right hand out and only manages to cut some pace on that"
5938,"1 run, dropped by AB. Didn't pick that clearly. At least that's what he's indicating to VK. Iyer tried to loft this straight, ended up hitting it miles in the air and it hung in for an eternity. AB backtracked all the way from covers, but ended up swirling all around it before grazing the ball off his fingertips"
5939,"byes, FOUR, foxing through everyone. Patel doesn't read the wrong 'un, pulls all around it, and it's too good for Pant behind as well. Never mind the dive at the ropes, Harshal Patel's boot is touching. Just"
5940,"out Caught by Prithvi Shaw!! Nope, the Mo experiment ain't coming good today. bowler hits his hard good length, Moeen tries crashing through the line as he goes to loft an uppish drive. The ball though gets big, gets the fat miscue and Prithvi Sahw at cover can catch, tonight. batsman c Prithvi Shaw b bowler 1(3)"
5941,"FOUR, draws the edge. But this is no England, this is not 2014 - so this will be a boundary. batsman's squared up with the angle going across him on off, jabs his bat out, outside-edging it past the lone slip"
5942,"FOUR, cheeky! This guy is not all about power! Full ball and he's smartly moved across to scoop this over the infield with fine leg inside the ring"
5943,"SIX, he's hit that in the airrr, not timed that well, there is a man at deep backward square leg, he jumps and it's evaded him. The length was just a bit too full, batsman got inside the line of this flighted delivery and slog-swept it over backward square leg"
5944,"SIX, finally, a 100-run partnership between batsman and AB this season. bowler bowls a good length delivery down the leg-side in trying to follow batsman, but the Indian captain is so good with his wrists and whips it away over mid-wicket"
5945,"FOUR, oh lovely. Third man is inside the ring and that is exactly why batsman wants to give himself a bit of room. Short of a length delivery outside off stump, batsman cracks the cut past backward point"
5946,"SIX, that's masterful! Masterful because he's picked this slower ball, waited and muscled the loft over long-on. Fifty for AB batsman as well. team fans would be delighted to see both AB and Kohli score fifties in the same innings. Part of the reason why they weren't clicking as a batting unit this season. Kohli is so happy for AB"
5947,"FOUR, oh you are unreal man! This fella has bowled a pretty decent leggie and you've whipped it with your rubber wrists from the within the stumps, finding the cow corner fence. Not many would have split deep mid-wicket and long-on because it's hard to time that ball so well with such a shot"
5948,"out Caught by Pant!! Now then, now then. Is this a bit of a turning point? Look at the turn for bowler. Pitched just outside off stump and spun big, sucked batsman into the drive and he went for a big drive targetting cover. He couldn't counter for the spin and got an edge, Pant somehow managed to cling on. batsman walks without waiting for the umpire. He's done his part, but he's livid with himself because he normally loves finishing games when set. batsman c Pant b bowler 70(40) [4s-7 6s-3]"
5949,"SIX, how easy was that? batsman has been in good touch, getting starts this season. This was a short delivery down the leg-side, batsman easily pulls it over long leg as he got inside the line"
5950,"out Bowled!! Oopsy! Why would you swipe across the line from a good length on this pitch. Made it look as if it stayed low. The scrambled seam delivery and the ball ignited the stumps after beating the ugly swipe from the batsman. Dan Vettori gestures to someone to go out now from the dugout. Okay, it's Sarfaraz! batsman b bowler 13(14) [6s-1]"
5951,"FOUR, lovely lofted drive and this should lift batsman's confidence. Straightaway looks to the heavens after connecting well. Full ball outside off stump, Sarfaraz hits this over cover"
5952,"FOUR, oh superbly guided away past point and he thanks the heavens again. Short of a length delivery outside off stump, Sarfaraz uses the pace on the ball and beats third man"
5953,"out Caught by Prithvi Shaw!! You got to be kidding me. Take a bow Shreyas Iyer. He's placed a man very straight behind the keeper and this ball goes to him. For a moment it looked a brilliant, cheeky scoop shot from batsman to this low full around off stump, until the little fella - Prithvi Shaw - sneaked across to his right into the frame. He almost made a mess of it, juggled and took it on the second attempt. Don't be harsh on batsman people, he actually played a good shot, but fell in the trap set by Iyer. batsman c Prithvi Shaw b bowler 11(8) [4s-2]"
5954,"SIX, bowler has actually bowled a full toss way outside off stump, but that big back and across movement of batsman helps him easily time this kind of sweep shot over backward square leg. He's just awesome to watch"
5955,"SIX, fitting finish from AB batsman. team are still alive and DD have officially been knocked out. Slower delivery outside off stump, AB waits for the ball and lifts this over long-off"
5956,"FOUR, goes straight. From the back of the hand goes bowler, flighting it full and Patel is quickly down slamming it down, with all the anger"
5957,"out Lbw!! There comes Nepal on a scoreboard -- you've officially been inducted. Sandeep after being smacked down gets it quicker, fuller, on middle. Parthiv done in for the length, it's just not there to be sweeping, but he tries, misses, and finds himself struck plumb. A rewind of his fall in Pune. Doesn't even bother considering a review, walks, quickly. batsman lbw b bowler 6(8) [4s-1]"
5958,"FOUR, that one sighter is enough. Premeditates another back of a length, gets his front leg out and delightfully crunches it, flat-batted through mid-wicket"
5959,"SIX, wo-aw. Picks up the length, with that jabby whip of his. And swishes it to split mid-on's left. It's a return show"
5960,"FOUR, keeps bettering them. Dala keeps it full, batsman isn't complaining, leans out, and inside-outs it over extra cover"
5961,"FOUR, his famed cut. Those four dots were always leading into this, doesn't try and go too hard, waits for the room dished out outside off get big and bisects mid-off and extra cover"
5962,"FOUR, you mind-reader batsman. Knows he's going to get it full, so moves away, gives room and with a measure of mid-off in the circle, goes inside-out in his lofted drive over. So very easy"
5963,"SIX, stands, plants his leg out and holds his position to punch it through the line. High, mighty, and Kotla's switched sides .. team, team. And you thought the earlier one was the shot of the night. Poor you"
5964,"FOUR, nothing half-tracker, AB's quick to pounce. And he does with a swipe, mowing it into mid-wicket. On, on"
5965,"FOUR, no it gets better. Some width in the float up, batsman crouches, with his rubber wrists, whisking it through extra cover"
5966,"1 run, flat and short enough for batsman to go back and tuck into the on-side towards long-on"
5967,"SIX, okay, you have to learn! Got away with one previous ball bowling full, this time the line is outside off and allows batsman to swing his arms. Easily lofted over long-off and AB is pretty good with his timing, isn't he?"
5968,"FOUR, tickled and fifty for captain batsman. Immediately raises the bat to the dug-out and the crowd. Looks determined as always. Really terrible short of length delivery down the leg-side, just helped on its way with fine leg inside the ring"
5969,"SIX, that's the bowler getting greedy with the turn on offer and offering a freebie. Way too full, the length is still acceptable, but the line is way outside off stump, got to be closer to the sticks. AB just waited for it and smashed that lofted drive over extra-cover"
5970,"FOUR, Sandeep offers width and batsman doesn't let it go scot-free. Flails his hands and creams it with super timing past a diving Manish Pandey at cover-point. First boundary of the innings"
5971,"SIX, bowler goes short and batsman dispatches it over long-on. Went back and flat-batted it disdainfully. The key was - he picked the length early"
5972,"FOUR, just bowled a slower ball, tries to repeat, but this is well outside off stump and the batsman read this from the hand. No third man, so batsman camps back and cuts past backward point. A 31-ball fifty for Watto, another very handy innings at the top"
5973,"SIX, gee there's a lot of audaciousness with the way he bats. He knows Kaul way too well. Two short balls first up in the over, but expects Kaul to try another one, the bowler dished out exactly what the batsman wanted and that back and across movement from batsman makes a strong statement that he is bossing the show, out comes the pull shot and clears deep mid-wicket. Brilliant fifty"
5974,"FOUR, wow! Just wow! The yorker goes as a juicy full ball and batsman thrashes the drive wide of extra-cover. Interesting to see Kaul try three bouncers and then only try the yorker. What's the thought process there?"
5975,"SIX, has he sliced this? Yes he has, but that bat in his hands is very good and it takes the ball all the way. The leggie outside off stump, batsman gets down on one knee and goes hard at it, looked like it was going to long-off for a moment, but this isn't Uppal. The boundaries are smaller"
5976,"SIX, this is precisely why team need batsman ASAP! Just look at him run down at team's key bowler. Got beaten previous ball, but no respect whatsoever and he forces Bhuvi to shorten the length, with it swings across the line with a pull and powers it over the mid-wicket boundary. He's just toying with them"
5977,"FOUR, the runs are leaking. Short of a length on the leg stump, poor line with not much of protection behind square on the on-side, batsman pulls and sends it to the long leg boundary"
5978,"SIX, oh my god! This guy is playing some outrageous shots. Flighted delivery from bowler, batsman steps out, gets closer to the pitch of the ball and slogs it hard over deep mid-wicket"
5979,"out Watson Run Out!! Shane Watson was moving slowly as he went for that run, wonder if he was carrying a niggle there. batsman pushed this flatter delivery towards extra-cover and set off, Watson was slow to take off, captain Kane threw it to the keeper, who did the rest. Finally a breakthrough for team, but Watson has done his job. Watson run out (Williamson/Goswami) 57(35) [4s-5 6s-3]"
5980,"out Caught by Williamson!! Now then, is there a change in the tale? team are masters at staging comebacks from nowhere. Don't write them off yet. Short of a length delivery it was from bowler, batsman wanted to play across the line, but he ended up slicing it towards mid-off, hit high on the bat, Kane ran to his left from extra-cover and put in the dive to complete the catch. batsman c Williamson b bowler 2(3)"
5981,"1 run, I can't believe my eyes. Manish Pandey has dropped a sitter by his standards. It's MS batsman too! Pandey is one of team's finest fielders. Flighted delivery on the stumps, batsman steps out and mistimes the loft, hit flat to long-on, Pandey was close to the rope, took it too casually and it popped out"
5982,"SIX, he's back to taking the aggressive route again. Advances, takes it on the full and muscles it over the man at long-off"
5983,"FOUR, use of the feet again, batsman is just rubbing it into bowler, who has had a catch being put down. Goes straight down the ground and over the umpire's head. Into the 90s now"
5984,"SIX, he got away with a couple of full tosses earlier in the over, but batsman has had enough. Absolutely tonks it flat over the square leg boundary. Just 8 needed now."
5985,"FOUR, oh he's hit this for four. team need 3 more to win and Rayudu needs one for a hundred. Length delivery down the leg-side, batsman swings it away behind square on the on-side"
5986,"1 run, that's it! Maiden IPL hundred. The crowd roars. What a knock from Ambati batsman. He takes the helmet off, raises the bat and enjoys the moment with a big smile. He has been exceptional this season. The teams applauds and Dhoni congratulates him too. Short of a length delivery on the leg stump, batsman moves across and works it towards square leg"
5987,"SIX, Sandeep's slower ball goes awry. It was the knuckle ball and batsman spotted it early. Squated low and helped it over short fine leg. Clears the rope for a maximum"
5988,"SIX, 'don't bowl short to me' - batsman's body language suggested as Sandeep overbakes and goes short. batsman stays in his crease, allows for the ball to come and pulls it with brute force over mid-wicket"
5989,"SIX, batsman gets into the act. Reaches out for a fuller length delivery outside off and effortlessly lifts it over extra cover"
5990,"FOUR, batsman brings out the sweep. Safe bet against the spin. Went low, rolled his wrists and placed it in the gap in front of square on the leg-side. Hooda from the deep ran across and dived near the ropes, but in vain"
5991,"FOUR, begins with a tripe on leg-stump. batsman accepts it with glee and glances it off his pads, beats short fine leg and races away to the fence"
5992,"FOUR, 50-up for team with this boundary. batsman takes on bowler, uses his feet and reaches the pitch. Lets his bottom hand do the talking. Lofting him over bowler's head"
5993,"FOUR, short, no real purpose and batsman pulls it away to the mid-wicket boundary. Didn't time it alright, but placed it in the gap. The ball hurried onto him a bit and that foiled his timing"
5994,"SIX, in the air and clears Hales at long-on. He seemed to have misjudged it there, runs forward and later realises that the ball is sailing over his head. Short again, batsman stayed back and smacked it flat and hard - enough wood to take it all the way"
5995,"FOUR, magnificent. No half-measures whatsoever. Saw a pitched up delivery outside off, props forward and presents a straight bat to drill it past mid-off. Third boundary of the over so far"
5996,"FOUR, splits the gap perfectly. bowler goes short once again, batsman stays low and pulls it through mid-wicket. Beats long-on and deep mid-wicket"
5997,"FOUR, half-tracker and punished. batsman camped back, twirls his wrists and hammers it to the cow corner fence. Shikhar had no chance cutting that off"
5998,"FOUR, a french cut to get his first boundary. On a good length around off, shaping into the batsman. batsman tries to fend it late and ends up getting an inside edge. Past the leg stump and all the way to the fence she goes, in a jiffy."
5999,"FOUR, that was four the moment it was hit. A good length delivery around off, batsman is quick to camp back and punch it away. Beats the fielder at extra cover and the man at sweeper cover too"
6000,"1 run, another 50-run stand up between these two. This was a short delivery and batsman pulled it down to long-on"
6001,"SIX, only a hit away from his fifty now. This was a full delivery outside off and batsman smoked it over long-on for half a dozen. Great shot by the southpaw"
6002,"FOUR, the boundaries have started to flow. A good length delivery outside off, batsman moves away and carves it over point. No chance for the fielder at third man to cut this down"
6003,"SIX, impressive! How well was this timed! Length ball on middle and leg, batsman pulls it over square leg for a well timed six. Came right from the meat of his willow"
6004,"SIX, what a shot to reach his fifty! Shortish delivery around off, batsman doesn't miss out on the opportunity and swings it over mid-wicket. Flat and over the ropes, she goes!"
6005,"SIX, if Dhawan from other end is changing gears, batsman decides to up the ante as well. Skips out, bowler gives more flight. KW isn't to the pitch, but still goes through by getting his weight forward. Sends it soaring over long-off. All the way!"
6006,"SIX, bread and butter for batsman. It looked as though he was waiting for it. bowler drops a rank long hop, batsman sits back and smokes it over cow corner. Into the crowd"
6007,"FOUR, 100-run stand comes up between the duo. Cross-seamer from bowler, but it's too full outside off. Can't bowl there with mid-off in the circle. batsman leans forward and drills it over the fielder's head beautifully"
6008,"FOUR, swings south does batsman. But the ball goes in the direction of north. He won't mind though as long as boundaries are coming. Shortish outside off, batsman goes hard and gets a thickish outside edge that flies away to the third man fence"
6009,"FOUR, stand and dismiss stuff from batsman. Just admires the shot, knew the moment he connected it was a boundary. bowler serves it full, in the slot and batsman blasts it with ease to the long-off fence. The fielder was squarer and had no chance"
6010,"FOUR, Bravo is welcomed to the crease with a boundary. Feeds it full, overpitches it a tad and batsman makes him pay by cracking it through extra cover"
6011,"1 run, and that's fifty for team's skipper batsman. His 10th IPL fifty. Continuing from where he left off from the last game. Eases a single to long-off and reaches the milestone, raises his bat to soak in the applause from the dug-out"
6012,"FOUR, expertly done. Uses his quick-silver hands to direct this wide yorker into the third man fence. Gets his bat down in time and threaded the gap between short third man and backward point with perfection"
6013,"out Caught by Harbhajan!! The breakthrough has been achieved. End of the 123-run stand between batsman and Williamson. Bravo, the man, with the much-needed wicket for team. Change of pace deceives batsman, who was into his cheeky lap way too early. Had to generate some power to get it over short fine leg, couldn't and ended up hitting it straight to Harbhajan, who pouches it at the edge of the ring. batsman c Harbhajan b bowler 79(49) [4s-10 6s-3]"
6014,"out Caught by Dwayne Bravo!! Woah. Screamer from DJ Bravo. This wicket purely belongs to him. Two wickets in two balls for team and they are fighting back here. Both set-batsmen back in the hut. Thakur went wider of off, batsman sliced it airly, there was a fielder at deep point. Bravo had to run across to his left, does so and brilliantly gobbles it up. He's a mighty fine fielder, breaks into a jig as well. batsman c Dwayne Bravo b bowler 51(39) [4s-5 6s-2]"
6015,"FOUR, mid-off in the circle and Hooda goes over his head. Scrambled seam lengh delivery around off, Hooda backs away and gives charge to lift it over mid-off"
6016,"no run, Hooda has been given out LBW, he has a word with his partner and decides to review. Bravo's foot is way behind the line, so no problems with the no-ball. Moving on, looks like no bat as well. Ultra-Edge confirms it. HawkEye in - Pitching - In-line. Impact - In-line. Wickets - missing. Superb review from Hooda. It was full and spearing in, Hooda was shuffling across and misses the clip. Is thudded low on the pad, the on-field call was OUT and Hooda challenged it. Gets the decision in his favour in the end with the ball missing the leg-stump"
6017,"out Caught by Willey!! Pandey perishes. team lose their fourth wicket. Cross-seam full ball from Thakur, Pandey went hard at it and the bat turned on impact in his hands. Hence, skies it towards long-off. Willey steps forward and grabs it with ease. The visitors are losing steam here. batsman c Willey b bowler 5(6)"
6018,"SIX, in the slot and out of the park. Thakur gets his line closer to off, Hooda stays still and biffs it powerfully over long-off"
6019,"FOUR, just eludes Rayudu's outstretched right hand. Bravo lands the slower ball on the middle stump, batsman gets low and slogs it across the line. Rayudu tried his best at square leg, but it evaded him"
6020,"FOUR, that'll give him some confidence. Length delivery on middle, batsman stands tall and pummels this one over mid-wicket, that's a fine shot by the southpaw"
6021,"FOUR, this one is even better. Full length ball outside off, batsman reaches for it and slaps it through the gap at extra-cover. The fielders on the off side had hardly any time to react"
6022,out Caught by Raina!! First blow of the match for Sunrisers. His struggle finally comes to an end. Never looked comfortable at the crease. Throws his hands at an away swinging length ball and ends up chipping it straight to Raina at cover-point. He wont miss those and reverse cups it in that region. Another fine start for the pacer. How often have we seen him doing this? batsman c Raina b bowler 2(9)
6023,"FOUR, that's the form he is in. Picks the length early on the shortish delivery. He's quick to transfer his weight on to the back foot and pull it to perfection through mid-wicket. Made sweet sound of the willow as the ball met it"
6024,"FOUR, well played! This was a tossed up delivery, batsman comes down the wicket and smokes it right over the bowler's head. Straight as an arrow, on a bounce and over the fence. Hit the cushions in fact"
6025,"FOUR, here it is! Finally a boundary against bowler. This was a half-volley outside off, batsman is quick to lean ahead and cream his drive through cover. Beats the two fielders chasing to stop this from reaching the fence"
6026,"FOUR, finally a boundary of batsman! That'll give him some relief. This was short one on leg, batsman does well to drag it down to the fine leg fence"
6027,"FOUR, poor effort by Bhajji near short fine leg. Perhaps he slipped there, hence couldn't stop the ball. This was a short one down the leg-side and batsman pulled it away, beating Harbhajan at short fine"
6028,"FOUR, now the homeboy roar. On the dance, in the slot and tonking it straight down. Oh the bat flow"
6029,"FOUR, defensively wide. Suryakumar smart enough, stays back, stretches and carves it away through extra cover"
6030,"FOUR, oh boy. If 0.3 was timing, this is its square. Pitched up, batsman strides, flows through with a defensive push. Yeah, that's all. And screeching past mid-off. Wow, Wankhede .."
6031,"no run, chipped up. And just short of a diving mid-on. Suryakumar's early into his flick, miscues, balloons, but Gowtham just can't dive down in time. Blame his frame. Oh no wait, these dastradly slomos tell us it's into his fingers first before it pops out"
6032,"FOUR, width. A helpful dragged back length too and he stays back, opens his bat face and whacks, hard, square"
6033,"out Caught by Unadkat!! All it required was for Archer to come back. Bends his back, digs it into the surface, climbing into Yadav, who given the pace is predictably late into his pull. Off the splice and Unadkat at fine leg almost makes a mess -- loses it in the light, spots it very late and plucks it right off the grass. batsman c Unadkat b bowler 38(31) [4s-7]"
6034,"out Caught by Unadkat!! And another. Oh batsman can't score against the Royals .. it's certified. A golden duck in Jaipur. A golden one now. Archer's bouncer ploy consumes him, with batsman being the compulsive puller going through with the swivelling flat-bat, timing it rather well in fact, but just not right when fine leg is that square. Another wobble, carrying on from the SMS? batsman c Unadkat b bowler 0(1)"
6035,"SIX, full toss. Talk about ruining a quiet over under the radar. batsman has his muscles blowing them out of here. 88 meters into the stands behind the sightscreen. And it's a fifty"
6036,"SIX, welcome back Kulkarni! Off-speed delivery and batsman picked the bones out of that, spotted it early and powered straight back over the bowler. He then stood and admired that shot"
6037,"out Caught by Samson!! Big wicket for Rajasthan. A well-set batsman throws it away. Kulkarni is delighted and his hands arm up. He had a chat with Unadkat before this delivery and whatever it was, it has worked. Nothing but an away angler outside off, batsman throws his hands at that and slices it towards sweeper cover, Samson covers ground to his right and clings on to a good catch. Royals fighting back after that opening partnership. batsman c Samson b bowler 60(42) [4s-4 6s-4]"
6038,"FOUR, not timed, but Kishan will collect the boundary. Rushed him with a short delivery and Kishan took it on, pulls off the splice and once it clears the fielder at mid-wicket, the lightning fast outfield does the rest"
6039,"FOUR, cheeky! He plays this shot quite a lot, does Pandya. Banged in and the line being outside off allowed Pandya to periscope the ramp to the third man fence. Got it fine enough to beat the fielder"
6040,"out Caught by Samson!! Another one down. What are you doing Mumbai? From 86/0 they have slipped to 119/4. Slower short of length delivery and Kishan didn't have the required room to free his arms on the pull shot, miscues it towards deep mid-wicket. Samson almost overran it, but then leaped back and took it reverse cup. batsman c Samson b bowler 12(11) [4s-1]"
6041,"out Caught by Gowtham!! Gowtham juggles but manages to hang on. Krunal never looked in. Yes, seven deliveries is enough to judge that. The off-cutter from bowler, Pandya had to for the heave and all he could do was sky it up towards long-on. Gowtham settled under it and almost made a mess. Luckily for him it didn't go far from his body and he took it on the second attempt. batsman c Gowtham b bowler 3(7)"
6042,"SIX, into the second tier. bowler is predictable with his change of pace and Pandya was waiting for it, cleared his front leg and smashed it straight back over the sightscreen. Mumbai need plenty more of this"
6043,"FOUR, now the attempted wide yorker goes wrong, full toss outside off, Pandya crouches a bit and slices it deliberately over backward point, one bounce and over the fence. Wankhede finds its voice again.."
6044,"SIX, bowler is dishing out freebies. Another nice juicy full toss outside off, just the right amount of width for Pandya to tonk the loft over extra cover. He didn't overhit; just a lift and off she went into the crowd. 17 already off the over"
6045,"1 run, dropped! Archer puts down a sitter. Warne is livid in the dugout but he isn't showing any emotions. batsman was deceived completely by the slower delivery and miscues the big hit towards point, Archer was a bit too casual with his approach and hence spills it"
6046,"SIX, batsman making team pay for the drop catch. bowler is slower ball is right in the slot, batsman delayed his shot for a second and hammered it with a clean swing over long-on"
6047,"FOUR, premeditated. Pandya shuffled across early and bowler smartly dragged his length back, Pandya still went through with his paddle and got the faintest of connection to beat Buttler to his left"
6048,"out Caught by Samson!! Stunner from Samson. Wow! The replays show it to be even better. Should be in the top five list. Full and angled in, Pandya whips it with plenty of bottom hand towards deep mid-wicket, Samson runs across to his right, but the ball seemed to be out his reach, that is when he decides to put in the full length dive and the ball sticks in his right hand when he is parallel to the ground. Simply superb! batsman c Samson b bowler 36(21) [4s-3 6s-2]"
6049,"3 runs, slogged high. Woah, it's checking the stratosphere. A cool ten seconds for it to come down, where Binny's done all the hard work of running back from mid-on .. to misjudge. Goes reverse cupped. There's never a good time to wait for anything, certainly not these swirlers"
6050,"FOUR, connects. Kulkarni gets a touch too straight in trying to cut off the off-side play, but Yadav's quick to get one-legged, lifting a glance of sorts over mid-wicket"
6051,"FOUR, he's expensive. Can't expect to pitch it up to Suryakumar and not pay the price .. it's the delightful price of watching it being driven straight back. Thank god for Lewis' duck, it's saved a head"
6052,"FOUR, short, nothing in terms of pace, everything in terms of width. And batsman makes it worse with him backing away, throws his hands out, gets a fat edge. And a vacant cordon is enough"
6053,"FOUR, 118.3kph. Those hands, those adjusting hands. It holds up for much longer, batsman almost commits into his slap early, but all of sudden can hold it, let the ball get close and guide it to point's left. Now .."
6054,"1 run, digs out a drive, almost drilling it past mid-off. Almost. Because Stokes is swooping down, releasing before he collects. A direct hit and Yadav was going back"
6055,"FOUR, full toss number five. And for a change batsman can put it away. Swings a little too hard, mistimes his swinging slap, but the powerplay is enough to find him the gaps at sweeper"
6056,"FOUR, nothing two-paced when you grant out a friendly overpitch. Lovely bat swing, opening up the gap over mid-off and timing the pants off it .. inside-out slap"
6057,"SIX, the launch. Can't bowl down leg, not a googly either. Knee, slog, sweep, backward square leg. It's flatly powerful enough to damage a billboard"
6058,"SIX, on the move, Gopal corrects on middle, but batsman' gone over extra cover. Throws every cell in his body into this hoick"
6059,"FOUR, that backlift. And then that drive on the up. So damn predictable. With mid-off in the circle, these are serious runs being leaked"
6060,"FOUR, streaky! bowler thought he had his man, so did Rohit. An curling low full toss right at the stumps, Short does extremely well to bring his bat down and squirt it off the inside edge to the fine leg fence. He was a goner had he missed"
6061,"out Caught by Ishan Kishan!! Short is gone. He's had a forgettable IPL season. Could not play spin and now has succumbed to pace as well. Back of a length and seaming away around off, Short goes feeling for the ball and the outside edge is found, it was carrying to first slip, but Kishan decides to dive across and glove it. The much needed early breakthrough for Mumbai. batsman c Ishan Kishan b bowler 4(5) [4s-1]"
6062,"FOUR, cracking shot! Losing Short might not be the worst thing happening for Rajasthan. Brings batsman in early and he likes the new ball coming on. Pitched up outside off, batsman leans forward and creams the drive through the packed off-side field. Off the mark in style"
6063,"SIX, that ones with the crowd now. Big hit over long-on there. bowler bowls it a touch slow, and batsman makes that last-minute room to chidingly loft it away"
6064,"no run, Krunal has won here. Not with a wicket yet, but with a review. Implored Rohit, convinced him, and the captain yielded. On first sighting, that's going down leg. Arm-ball that batsman's trying to sweep. Misses and is hit on the front pad. Ball-tracking suggests that the impact is on leg-stump, so with the left-armer's angle from round the wicket, that must be going down. Is actually. Not out. Review wasted."
6065,"FOUR, a helluva lot happened off this one ball. Now batsman was shaping to scoop, and bowler nicely bowls the cutter wider of off-stump. batsman adjusts though. Slices it, making the most of the room he had, but wasn't in control. Just cleared short third man's right-handed leap"
6066,"FOUR, five fifties in a row for batsman in IPL 2018. He's equaled the record of Sehwag, who was harvesting runs for a living back in 2012. And what a way to get there. Backs away, exposes the stumps and slaps the ball from in front of them audaciously. Connects. Anyone who's near as good as Sehwag -- statiscally! -- will connect"
6067,"FOUR, some width on the cutter, and that cut shot creams past Lewis's dive at deep cover. Just slid through the ball there, cutting the trajectory at 90 degrees. Must be a good outfield"
6068,"out Caught by Suryakumar Yadav!! That's a crucial wicket. batsman's found long-off, where SKY takes the catch and has a pratfall. Just lost his balance a bit and slipped backwards. Was a front footed power-punch but there's not enough wattage in the shot. So much for being a touch player. And here's Pandya picking a wicket just when you least expect him to. batsman c Suryakumar Yadav b bowler 37(36) [4s-4]"
6069,"SIX, not quite as pretty as those Dhoni's bottom-handed whips over long-on but this is good enough. Carries all the way. Takes on the seam-up length ball and muscles it across the line"
6070,"FOUR, front leg is already out of the way, and this fuller delivery goes for a four. Just moved a little to the off-stump and opened his torso side-on, and goes through with the flat mow through long-on"
6071,"FOUR, he's making a living out of his hands. Nicely keeps his weight distributed between front and back, so he can go either way. Opens the stance and swats this back of a length delivery over mid-wicket"
6072,"SIX, and now one better. Swivels this time, and deposits the short ball over long leg this time. Game slipping, or has it already?"
6073,"FOUR, drifting on leg-stump and it's been cutely paddled away. Runs very fine, through keeper's left and runs for a boundary. Not a great start that by bowler"
6074,"FOUR, he's joining the party. Very slow from bowler, trying to get batsman to miscue one, but doesn't on this occasion. Makes room, waits for the dip and lofts it over straight mid-on"
6075,"FOUR, that's been muscled through long-on. Going against bowler's angle from over the wicket and going through the line. One bounce and into the ropes. Just the 16 needed"
6076,"SIX, that's flown off batsman's bat. He walks stone-faced to the middle of the pitch and punches gloves with Buttler. Slow ball sitting up and batsman mowing it over cow corner has to be a sight to behold"
6077,"SIX, this is a glorious glorious pull. Pandya just stares and walks back to the top of his mark. You do that when you've been pulled off the front foot, and the ball flies over deep mid-wicket"
6078,"out Caught by (sub)Rahul Chahar!! With 4 needed, he goes for the glory hit and falls. Slow cutter, batsman went for the all-hands loft over cover and found Chahar in the deep. batsman c (sub)Rahul Chahar b bowler 26(14) [4s-2 6s-2]"
6079,"SIX, Mumbai batsman'ed at home. Slow ball sitting up and martyed over cow corner"
6080,"FOUR, wrong lines. Off-cutter down leg, batsman tickles it fine past short fine leg. The fast outfield does the rest"
6081,"FOUR, second boundary and it is to the same area. This was not on leg-stump, but straight enough for batsman to glance it wristily past short fine leg, just used the pace on the ball"
6082,"FOUR, wow! That is a fine shot. Moved away to leg and even a dragged back length didn't deter him, went up and over the infield off the back foot. A very difficult shot to play but batsman made it look easy"
6083,"SIX, just over Hardik. The slog sweep and batsman almost found the only man in the deep on the leg-side, shuffled across and mistimed the sweep towards deep mid-wicket. Hardik jumped but the ball was well over him"
6084,"FOUR, that's more like it. Stand and deliver. Gets a length ball in his arc and he gives it his all. In fact it was the knuckle ball and batsman dispatched it straight back over Hardik"
6085,"FOUR, that was an attempted slower delivery but it turned out to be a full toss. Manjrekar on air said how he's never seen bowler bowl ""such a slower ball."" Anyway, batsman makes a bit of room and thumps that to the fence through long-off"
6086,"1 run, a low full toss in trying to bowl flat from over the wicket, batsman pats it to long-on to bring the 50-run stand up"
6087,"FOUR, a bit of flight and batsman goes through the line. Weight on front foot and boom, it's flying over straightitsh long-on already"
6088,"no run, dropped!! Parthiv dives to his left and the ball pops out of his left mitt. That angled away late and the batsman poking at it, got a thick edge. The keeper went for it one-handed only to drop it. His left hand was lower than the actual trajectory of the ball and that meant he was hit higher on the palm, forcing the spill"
6089,"SIX, welcome to the attack bowler! Dragged back length and batsman makes room to thump the pull over deep mid-wicket. That is a monster hit from the Aussie and he remains the key for team"
6090,"out Caught by Kohli!! bowler strikes. Each of Kohli's moves have paid off today. Brought in Siraj got a wicket, de Grandhomme did the same and bowler follows. Bit of air on this one and batsman is down on one knee to play the slog sweep, does not get the required elevation to clear deep mid-wicket and finds Kohli to perfection. The skipper had moved himself there after the third ball. team slip further and their chances of getting a good total are gone with batsman. batsman c Kohli b bowler 26(23) [4s-1 6s-2]"
6091,"out batsman Run Out!! That's what wickets and pressure do. There was never a single in it and batsman wanted the run, Axar was tad late in sending him back and the skipper's dive was in vain. Nothing but a tossed up delivery which batsman taps to the left of cover, Axar took a step out before aborting from the run. And with batsman not being the swiftest he was always in trouble. Put in a desperate dive but was still short by some distance. batsman run out (Negi/Parthiv Patel) 0(1)"
6092,"out Caught by Parthiv Patel!! What happened there? Looks like Tye wanted to review. But he's walking back. Not sure what happened. Banged in and with Umesh's pace the ball climbs up awkwardly, Tye goes for the pull and a faint top-edge settles into Parthiv's mitts. Did he run out of time to review? That might be the only reason. Nonetheless, there was a sound as the ball passed the bat. batsman c Parthiv Patel b bowler 0(3)"
6093,"out batsman Run Out!! A typical number 10 run-out. Mohit works the off-break past mid-wicket, but was not sure whether to go for the run or not, he decides late and AB from mid-wicket runs back, slides and fires a throw to Mo, who deflects the ball onto the stumps. Brilliant bit of work from AB and Mo. batsman run out (de Villiers/bowler) 3(5)"
6094,"out Rajpoot Run Out!! 1 run completed. team have been bowled out for 88. batsman wanted to keep the strike and pushed Rajpoot for a non-existent second. In fact, it was Rajpoot who wanted the second. batsman worked the flatter delivery towards wide long-on, he was content with the single but upon seeing Rajpoot charge across, he relcutantly went for it, nice flat throw right next to the stumps from Southee and Mo did the rest. Rajpoot run out (Southee/bowler) 1(5)"
6095,"SIX, hello says the batsman as he was greeted with a short ball. The batsman did not waste time to transfer his weight on the back foot and hammers it over deep backward square leg off the front foot. Terrific hit"
6096,"SIX, short ball, journey ball and goes the distance. The batsman this time stayed firm on the back foot and hammered the pull over deep fine leg for a sixer. Into the second tier"
6097,"FOUR, powers the ball away! That is a four. Little backing away movement and the batsman gatecrashes that one past cover for a four. The lack of pace did not help"
6098,"FOUR, that is typical batsman! Clears his front leg, moves to the leg-side and then the long tentacles get into the act. Fetches the short of length delivery and clubs the pull away towards the deep mid area for a four"
6099,"FOUR, absolute gift! Full toss, little dip on it but the batsman lifts the ball away easily over mid-off's head for a four. This will break the shackles"
6100,"SIX, picks the slower short ball like dead meat and picks the bones out of it by smacking it over deep mid-wicket. He waited on it and then smashed it out of his sight. Third six of the evening for batsman"
6101,"out Caught by de Grandhomme!! The short ball does it. You live by the sword and you die by it as well. The short balls had been disappearing but not this one. This came on slightly quicker on to the batsman, skidded on and batsman went for it by hitting it flat. The man at deep square leg raced to his right and took it really well as the momentum on the ball threatened a drop from CDG. But that is a huge wicket!! batsman c de Grandhomme b bowler 21(15) [6s-3]"
6102,"FOUR, clears his front leg again, the typical batsman template to get the boundaries away and is successful. The men at cover and mid-off had no chance. The length ball also helped the cause of the batsman"
6103,out Caught by Siraj!! The short ball is doing the trick here. The batsman got a huge top edge and Siraj at deep square leg gobbles it up. Banged in short at a good pace and again the batsman never got a lot of distance on it. The ball went really high and the fielder did well to munch on it. team have already got their back broken. And team are looking to inflict more wounds. batsman c Siraj b bowler 18(14) [4s-4]
6104,out Caught by Kohli!! Catching practice! And taken to his left at slip by the skipper. That was an away going short of length delivery and the batsman just opened his bat face to run it down. Cardinal sin it was with a slip in place. team are all over team like a rash. The battle of the reds certainly has seen the visitors having the upper hand in the powerplay period. batsman c Kohli b bowler 1(3)
6105,"FOUR, tries to land it on a length and is greeted with a drive on the up. Lovely timing and placement on it takes it away to the fence. batsman is away"
6106,out Bowled!! The yorker from bowler. Played it too late and did not pick the length to york himself. The ball sneaking under the bat. How on earth?! That was the googly. team in deep waters now. batsman can't believe his luck. That was just a well flighted ball and he fails to pick it up. The LED bails sparkled red and team rejoiced more. Where is the fight team? batsman b bowler 2(3)
6107,"SIX, this is exactly what team don't want. That was full and that disappeared. Booming hit over covers for a sixer. Flat and powerful. This landed in the range of the batsman and batsman drop kicked the ball away. Is there batsman magic on the cards?"
6108,out Caught by Parthiv Patel!! It cannot get any worse for team and batsman. He is having a terrible season and has only dashed the hopes of a team revival in this game as well. Gentle delivery on the pads and the batsman ended up nicking it to the keeper. The keeper went up almost instantly and team have their man. batsman c Parthiv Patel b bowler 2(6)
6109,"FOUR, Parthiv decides to get a move on. On the shorter side from bowler and it's leg stumpish as well. Pulled away through the gap between mid-wicket and mid-on. Races away"
6110,"FOUR, gift for Parthiv and he accepts it with glee. Tye strays on the pads with a half-volley, easily glanced away down to the fine leg fence"
6111,"FOUR, that's a signature batsman stroke. Not all that full but there was width and that's what the southpaw loves. Uses his quick hands to power it on the up through the gap at cover"
6112,"SIX, look at the swagger on this shot! With due respect to bowler, the man facing him is just too good. Full and in the slot, it's in the arc for batsman who nonchalantly clubs this into the stands at cow corner. Cold welcome for the young man"
6113,"FOUR, hammered away. Cannot bowl that length at this pace to batsman. He'll punish you all night. Back of a length from bowler and it's pulled away wide of mid-on. All too easy"
6114,"FOUR, he is on the charge, is batsman. He doesn't want to let this opportunity of a crushing win slip. Charges down the track and makes some room for this good length delivery. Slaps it away over point comfortably"
6115,"1 run, dropped! Finch the culprit at mid-off, was late to trek backward and in the end, he did get a hand on it but spilled it. Low full toss from bowler that batsman mistimed. The loft came off the toe end and eventually, he got lucky. Second life for the skipper"
6116,"leg byes, 1 run, batsman survives easily in the end. Looked closer to the naked eye but when team reviewed it, Hawk Eye showed it to be missing leg stump comfortably. Fuller ball that angled into batsman, he was on the shuffle and missed the flick. Looked really close initially, not to be"
6117,"FOUR, crunched away! Full and quite wide outside off, right up Parthiv's street and he feasts on it. Unfurls a lovely square drive through cover-point. Blazed away in a flash"
6118,"FOUR, good adjustment from Parthiv. Seemed like he was early on this slower bouncer but then decided to just control it. Got it wide of short fine leg and that was enough. Brings up the 50 as well"
6119,"FOUR, this has been pummelled away. Banged in short by Mohit and this is the normal pace delivery, sits up nicely for Parthiv who swats the pull through backward square leg. The man from deep square did try hard to get to it but was never going to reach it in time"
6120,"FOUR, deft touch from batsman. Pacy back of a length delivery, he just waits on it and dabs it late. Only had to beat the short third man fielder and he did it with ease"
6121,"SIX, that's dumped over long-off. team cantering away to victory. Just a few blows away if they go at this rate. Too full from Andrew and it's criminal with mid-off up. batsman launches it over the infield and it goes away for a flat maximum"
6122,"FOUR, sublime, really sublime. Oh, he is making this look like an exhibition match. Short of a length, a touch wide and he stands tall to punch it beautifully through backward point. Timed it so sweetly"
6123,"FOUR, fantastic placement. A trifle too short from bowler and batsman clobbers the pull by standing up tall. Splits deep mid-wicket and long-on with precision"
6124,"FOUR, back to normal pace and Tye suffers. Shortish length and Parthiv waits to ramp it just wide of Rahul. Got it very fine and third man had no chance. Just a hit away now"
6125,"FOUR, team have demolished team! Not the fairytale big hit to finish but a boundary nevertheless. Short ball and batsman only manages a top edge on the pull. Gets it comfortably over a leaping Rahul and that's the end of that"
6126,"SIX, how that's! Skid it into batsman, who went with it and swung it over deep mid-wicket"
6127,"FOUR, this flies squarer but he's middled it again somewhat. Swivels a little, carting the ball round the corner"
6128,"SIX, now puts on the wheels. Comes down the track and mauls it over long-on. bowler clasps his hands but that's not in appreciation, as you'd have guessed"
6129,"FOUR, he's an antidote to everything that bowler can be tonight. Backs away and lofts one at the stumps, splitting the air-gap between mid-off and extra cover"
6130,"out Caught by Gowtham!! Gowtham is dramatic in his celebration. If you don't know why, scroll down and see how he was taken for runs in the last over. Takes the catch at extra cover and flings the ball at the stumps, and aggressively. A little OTT, the celebrations, but team will take it. A short ball from bowler does the trick. batsman is awkward as he goes back but is not really in a position to swat that across. Miscues that in the air and is caught. batsman c Gowtham b bowler 21(7) [4s-2 6s-2]"
6131,"FOUR, 119.3kph. And then half way down the pitch. And then down leg. Well .. well. Lynn swivels, adjusts to the lack of bounce. But pulls, very fine"
6132,"FOUR, that's the ruin. All the width put out for batsman to get .. and he chases, carving it over extra cover"
6133,"FOUR, 118.9kph. And then length and width. Lynn gets forward, and rocks back in a fierce cut. Nothing a diving point can do"
6134,"FOUR, rub in the luck too. Neat bouncer, at the nose, but Lynn's already moving away, putting everything in his hooky-swing. Gets a fat edge that proves just enough to clear the keeper"
6135,"FOUR, gets cheeky. Picks up the floaty leggie outside off, knows there's nobody at third man. And reverses. Nailing it past slip"
6136,"out Caught by Anureet Singh!! Strokes has another. Oh where was he hiding all this while? Anyway, it takes him to dish out a short-slower sticker into the pitch. Lynn as usual can't resist, loads up with a leg-cleared-cut. But doesn't quite adjust to the time the ball takes in getting there, slices off the top-edge and deep point couldn't have been placed better. batsman c Anureet Singh b bowler 45(42) [4s-5 6s-1]"
6137,"leg byes, 1 run, it slams the pad. Buttler seems to be jumping up in appeal. bowler is busy trying to clean up the possible leg bye. Oh Rajasthan have to take it up. It's all up to the angle .. how big is it getting? Okay so DK has missed the glance, he's stuck in front of middle. And yes, HawkEye shows it clipping the edge of the bail. Everyone's happy"
6138,"FOUR, innocuously short, dishing out full pace. Russell gets back fiercely on his back leg, swings his cut, going over point and almost into deep point .. millimeters"
6139,"FOUR, pulls out some deft dabs from his bag of tricks. bowler keeps going through with full-paced seam ups .. batsman's waiting, showing it the opened up face and dabbing it just wide of Buttler's dive"
6140,"FOUR, oh the hammer. Brute. Archer misses the yorker by an inch, Russell takes out a mile. Launching into the overcook to crunch it through the covers"
6141,"FOUR, genuine edge. Zips up off the turf to take the splice on batsman's lost overused dab. But the pace is enough to run it into third man. Or is it? Gowtham chases, dives, but nope, can't get his hand off the ball while his leg touches the rope"
6142,"SIX, goes over. And Kolkata keep the 16-pointer dream alive. Shortened length, batsman deposits it into long-on with an all muscle heave"
6143,"SIX, a 145ks delivery no good for all-hands Lynn. Moves a little leg-side and scythes this short incoming delivery over backward square leg. Didn't even rock back fully. Didn't need to"
6144,"FOUR, now over third man. Just bounces inside the ropes and hits the cushions on the half-volley. bowler bowled it short again but shifted the line to outside off, and batsman nicely ramps it away"
6145,"out Caught by R Tripathi!! This is not over yet, folks. Second short ball from bowler that gets the wicket. Got a little big on batsman, who agreeably was pirouetting well on the back toe. Ended up top-edging it high to deep backward square, where Tripathy was waiting. batsman c R Tripathi b bowler 4(6)"
6146,"FOUR, that's a nice drive through covers. batsman leaning a bit into it and reminding bowler that he wasn't the batsman who faced the short ball, so a full ball outside off isn't going to work"
6147,"FOUR, past Samson's one-handed effort at backward point. An uppish cut shot that he placed just wide enough of the fielder"
6148,"FOUR, that's past backward point's dive. Got the ball to straighten on off-stump, which makes batsman's shot a good one. Didn't have much room to work, so uses his cocked wrists and thrusts the ball away"
6149,"SIX, bowler's horror isn't over. Brilliant loft from batsman, stepping out and timing it over extra cover. Flew into the crowd"
6150,"out Lbw!! Loud shout for LBW. And Rajasthan go upstairs with the review. Drifted across from over the wicket and it spun into the left-hander, surprising him with the turn. Pitching just outside off-stump -- slowmo replays suggest -- and rapping the front leg near the knee-roll. Impact on middle and that's crashing into the top of leg-stump, says ball-tracking. So batsman will have to go, as team hold on to their review. batsman lbw b bowler 21(17) [4s-2 6s-1]"
6151,"FOUR, that's a glorious front-foot punch through covers. Gets on his toes and on top of the bounce to pack a punch through diving cover"
6152,"1 run, dropped! Fired in on a short of length @144.8kmph, angling in towards leg, Tripathi is intimidated and tentatively defends off the back foot, gets an edge to third man for a single as Rana drops it at slip... Went flying for it two-handed but no dice"
6153,"SIX, full and not too wide, on off-stump in fact, Tripathi makes his own width by making room outside off and slices that over the sweeper cover fence for six! Massive hit!"
6154,"FOUR, short and a little wide, no power, just a dab off the back foot, placed perfectly behind backward point for four. Surgical precision..."
6155,"FOUR, a bit of swing away from a good length outside off, Tripathi tries a preempted helicopter and gets a leading edge to third man for four."
6156,"FOUR, perfect length, but it doesn't matter which variation it was, batsman reaches out and sweeps it hard to backward square leg for four. Incredible shot, and four..."
6157,out Lbw!! The flattish ball spun in sharply and hit the batsman high on the back leg. Looks a little high. Was there an inside edge? NO! The height is not an issue. Three Reds. team are going down like a lead balloon. The ball skidded on and the batsman was late on the attempted swat on the on-side. This is tragedy for team. From 59 in 4 overs to this. T20 cricket and its speed taking a toll on team. In dire straits. batsman lbw b bowler 12(10) [4s-2]
6158,"out Stumped!! The googly and team implode further. The batsman predictably does not read it. Looks to whip a flighted ball outside off and misses it. The ball turned away past the blade and DK does the rest. He whipped the bails off in a flash. Kuldeep leaps up in his celebratory jump. The spinners are choking their opponents here. You have seen this script from team. Haven't you?
batsman st Karthik b bowler 1(4)"
6159,"out Caught by Karthik!! The pace has the last laugh. Disconcerting bounce coupled with it forces an almost evasive action from batsman, who fails to get his gloves out of the way. The ball flicked the gloves and went up for the keeper to take it with ease. The Eden is alive and noisy. Eden has witnessed many collapses and this one is dear to team. batsman c Karthik b bowler 3(5)"
6160,"out Caught&Bowled!! The last straw is gone. team will drown it seems. Too full, flighted as well and the toe-ended push finds the bowler. The bowler stays low and pouches it. DK and team erupt. A hattrick against Aussies and now this. Kuldeep can't do anything wrong at the Eden. A 4-fer in a big game. batsman ends a horron run in the IPL. He has been off-color throughout and it has ended like that as well. batsman c and b bowler 11(13)"
6161,"FOUR, just a push..may be an exagerrated punch. But that raced away across the turf past the man at cover. Whatta shot. Not a pushover for sure"
6162,"SIX, short ball and six! That was a splendid hit. More of a reactive shot as he looked like he was slightly late on it but that travelled the entire journey. Over the deep square region and Mavi takes some more punishment"
6163,"FOUR, little short outside off and the batsman latches on to it. Smokes the cut past point and the ball reaches the ropes. These are useful runs on the board"
6164,"FOUR, phew! That was close. Shortish, again slightly turning in and the cut is played off the top-half of the bat. The man at backward point leapt up but still could not even get finger-tips to it. 10 runs of the over and team fight on thanks to this cameo from batsman. bowler ends a decent spell - 4-0-29-1"
6165,"out Caught by Karthik!! The yorkerish delivery was jammed out and it popped up. team think it went off the boot and into the keeper's gloves. They may be right!! It seems the batsman did jam it out off the inner half of the bat but into his boot. And then it went up for DK to take it and bring to the notice of the umpires that they should go upstairs. They did, the soft signal was not out but was not to be as the replays were conclusive enough for the third umpire to make the decision. batsman c Karthik b bowler 1(6)"
6166,"FOUR, not a bad start! Short ball at the body and pulled away into the on-side for a four. The man at fine leg had no chance. He played it slightly late but did well to get enough meat on it"
6167,"out Caught by Shubman Gill!! Another one bites the dust. team fans find their voices again. Short ball, rising up and the batsman trying to pull it away, managed only a lot of height. The man at deep square leg came in and took it, not exactly with a lot of ease but effectively in the end. Might have lost it in the lights. batsman c Shubman Gill b bowler 6(5) [4s-1]"
6168,"out Bowled!! team won't play out their quota of overs. That was a slower delivery and the batsman went for the slog sweep but was outdone by the lack of pace on it. The batsman knelt down, may be guessed the pace right, but could not connect at all for the LED bails to lighten up. team camp is chuffed. So is the crowd and the entire team. The on-field umpire did check for a no-ball but it is team's evening and nothing can go wrong. batsman b bowler 26(18) [4s-3 6s-1]"
6169,"FOUR, why try the helicopter when you can play these? Half-volley, on middle and leg, Tripathi gets slightly forward and push-drives it straight down the ground for four. 19 off the over."
6170,"FOUR, short and wide, batsman is about half a meter outside leg reaches out Sehwagesquely to slice it towards the third man boundary for four"
6171,"SIX, fuller length delivery just outside off, batsman preempts the periscope and laps it over the tiny fine leg boundary for six!"
6172,"FOUR, short and fractionally wide, batsman has a lower and wide stance and has a solid base to execute the perfect cut shot to deep backward point for four. Unbelievable..."
6173,"FOUR, length ball outside off, a cardinal sin in T20, batsman opens up his stance, clears his front leg, and carts it away cross-battedly to long-on for four. team bowlers under fire, and batsman's epiphany continues..."
6174,"SIX, he moves leg, moves to the off-side again, picks up the good length ball on the stumps to ramp it over fine leg for another six. Last 9 balls: 6 fours, 3 sixes."
6175,"FOUR, full and wide outside off, batsman reaches out and slices that away to square third man for four, and that's the second time Mavi has conceded more than 28 in an over in this IPL. Surreal hitting..."
6176,"FOUR, flatter trajectory, off-break and in the slot, batsman gets on his knees and mows that to wide long-on with a slog-sweep. Up comes the 50 partnership!"
6177,"FOUR, thats almost an inch-perfect yorker outside off, errs marginally, batsman, with all his hockey experience, gets under it to bottom-hand that away to the deep extra cover fence for four"
6178,"out Caught by Karthik!! Gone! A sigh of relief for the hosts! Short one angling towards the leg-side, and the side-on stance of Tripathi gives him that fraction of a second less to get into the hook. Beaten for pace, and he gets a feather of a glove on it to DK behind the stumps. Is this the breakthrough, or the rhythm-breaker that team needed? The crowd would certainly hope so! batsman c Karthik b bowler 27(15) [4s-4 6s-1]"
6179,"FOUR, shortish off-break, erring in line, drifting into the pads, whipped away off the back foot to the backward square leg fence for four. Threaded the needle there..."
6180,"out Bowled!! Oh, it's ugly when a batsman with a Test hundred in almost every country tries circus tricks. Kuldeep fires in the googly on middle and leg, batsman gets across his stumps and tries to whack it away behind point with a reverse sweep, misses it altogether and ends up making a fool of himself. The furniture is knocked over, and a the flashing red bails reflect ominous signs for team. batsman b bowler 11(12) [4s-1]"
6181,"FOUR, just a fraction short, a tad outside off, batsman pokes it with an angled bat away to the third man fence for four. Races away..."
6182,"out Caught by Searles!! Massive moment! Fullish one, too full to reverse, batsman goes for it anyway, and gets it off the top half of the bat, and lobs it to Searles at short third man. A tame end to an otherwise excellent innings, and batsman's streak of 5 consecutive 50s comes to an end. 3 down, and Kuldeep has made an important breakthrough. batsman c Searles b bowler 39(22) [4s-5 6s-2]"
6183,"SIX, long stop! Leave the bat regulations alone, they've gotta have some boundary regulations! A 64-meter six! A shortish ball on the hips, batsman shuffles across and swat-pulls it half-heartedly, gets a top-edge over the long stop fence for six"
6184,"FOUR, that's well done. batsman walked across, expecting Krunal to keep it straight and quick. He got inside the line of the ball and then swept it powerfully past short fine leg"
6185,"1 run, 102kph, batsman knocks it down to long-on to bring up yet another fifty this season. What a time he's having"
6186,"1 run, back of a length, batsman is hopping back in the crease as he defends it to the left of short mid-wicket, so he really has to put the skates on as he bolts towards the non-striker's end. McClenaghan throws himself forward as he releases the ball in one motion along with the dive, but batsman gets there"
6187,"FOUR, short fine leg is motionless as batsman helps this pull shot past him. Poor ball really. Angled into the body from round the wicket, all batsman has to do is to miss the lone fielder after swivelling across and that's what he does as he leaves Surya a mere statue"
6188,"FOUR, mid-off is up so batsman clears his front leg in order to go over the infield. It's a short of length delivery from bowler, not the ideal ball to hit straight down the ground, but batsman had his mind made up. He flat-bats it hard enough, and although it came off the toe-end, it's enough to go over the fielder. Cutting gives good chase and tries hauling it back in with a slide, but his foot was in contact with the ropes"
6189,"FOUR, he's hit that with a battering ram! Makes some room, Krunal darts it into the slot for batsman who tonks the leather off it by muscling it back over the bowler's head. Krunal tried going for the catch, but by then the ball was whistling into the fence"
6190,"SIX, this is the ball he wanted. A bit of flight from bowler, batsman gallops down to the pitch of it and lofts it cleanly over long-on"
6191,"SIX, and again. Much cleaner, much bigger. The Kings XI dugout is on its feet as batsman finishes the over off with back-to-back sixes. Puts his dancing shoes on again and swings through the line of the delivery"
6192,"out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! Outstanding pressure catch from Hardik Pandya in the deep. batsman had skied this up a mile off a top-edge, he had Evin Lewis in the corner of his eye - converging towards him, but Pandya calls for it and takes it much to the delight of the roaring fans at the Wankhede. Length ball, batsman saw the opportunity and cleared his front leg to make the most of it. But his heave came right off the toe-end. batsman c Hardik Pandya b bowler 46(35) [4s-3 6s-1]"
6193,"out Caught by Ishan Kishan!! Hoho, batsman doesn't have a clue of what's happened. He's too slow. This bumper from bowler hurries on from the middle of the pitch, and even as batsman tries sitting down to it, he leaves his gloves up there. The ball kisses them enroute to Ishan Kishan. A gamechanger this bowler over. batsman c Ishan Kishan b bowler 1(2)"
6194,"FOUR, batsman gets this away! This is the man standing between team and victory. Short of length at the body, batsman nails the pull backward of square"
6195,"FOUR, oh my, this is extraordinary. The expression on Rohit's face, rather the blankness of it tells the story. Wide leg-cutter from bowler, batsman switches his stance and reverse-scoops it over short third man"
6196,"FOUR, he's done it again. He has done it again. Quite brilliant. Slower ball wide of off, and batsman puts it over short third man's head. He's whisked into the 90s. Some player this lad"
6197,"out Caught by Cutting!! bowler wins the battle with batsman. He has sent Wankhede rocking. Slower ball, it deceives batsman as he lofts it right off the toe-end into the grateful hands of Cutting at long-off. So then, is that it for Punjab? batsman c Cutting b bowler 94(60) [4s-10 6s-3]"
6198,"out Caught by Lewis!! Full ball outside off, batsman slices it straight to Lewis at sweeper cover. He was right back in the crease expecting the fuller length, and was probably aiming to go inside out over extra cover. But the bat twisted in his hands. A fist-pump from bowler. batsman c Lewis b bowler 1(3)"
6199,"SIX, it's not over yet. batsman has pumped this full toss over the ropes. bowler misses the blockhole, and disappears over mid-wicket"
6200,"SIX, abysmal start for Hardik (sans highlights), a lousy half-tracker, batsman just swivels into an effortless six in front of deep square leg"
6201,"FOUR, another short one, this time across the left-hander, batsman tries to cut it away, gets a top-edge over the fly slip and towards fine third man for four"
6202,"FOUR, edged, and gone for four! Fortuitous boundary to third man. Knuckle ball pitching on a length, seaming away, batsman gets a controlled outside edge with soft hands and it rolls away to the third man fence"
6203,"FOUR, short of length delivery at the body, swivelled away past short fine leg. But it doesn't matter. team clinch this by three runs to stay alive in the tournament"
6204,"FOUR, yet another slower one, errs in length this time, half-cook, and batsman transfers his bodyweight into an elegant extra cover drive for four. Balances himself and poses for the cameras after the shot. Yep, that was right out the meat!"
6205,"FOUR, geee, that was hit hard. Fuller ball just outside off, batsman clears his front leg and slugs that over mid-on to the long-on fence for four. Lands just short of the rope. Odd how the top-edge carried and this didn't :O"
6206,"out Caught by Cutting!! A short one, outside off, batsman tries to fetch it and attempts a pull, gets a top-edge. The ball crosses the stratosphere, makes a trip to heaven and lands up in the lap of Ben Cutting coming in from deep mid-wicket. Made it look rather easy. Universe Boss departs. batsman c Cutting b bowler 18(11) [4s-2 6s-1]"
6207,"SIX, gigantic, massive, monstrous! Length ball outside off, a huge no-no in T20, batsman gets room to swing his arms, and goes through the line, golf-swings that over wide long-on for six. Monumental hit..."
6208,"FOUR, a hint of flight, pretty good length, on off stump, batsman gets down the wicket and lofts it nonchalantly towards long-on for four"
6209,"1 run, slightly short, batsman is early into it as it stuck in the pitch a little, carved to cover where Cutting makes an excellent effort but drops it!"
6210,"FOUR, fired in on the stumps again, lap-swept expertly to fine leg for four. Knew where the short fine fielder was and got it well past him"
6211,"FOUR, flat leg-break just around off-stump, batsman crouches low and cuts that when it was inches from the stumps past backward point for four"
6212,"FOUR, short and wide outside off, batsman carves it away to deep backward point for four. A hit-me delivery and gets the treatment."
6213,"2 runs, back of a length delivery around off, batsman gets on the back foot and punches that to deep backward point for a brace. 50 partnership up!"
6214,"FOUR, edged and four, width on offer from bowler and Suryakumar threw his bat at that, gets a healthy edge that flies through the vacant second slip region"
6215,"SIX, the first six of the evening - on a good length and just outside off, batsman got forward on the lofted drive, didn't time it all that well - ended up slicing it high and over mid-off - has enough to clear the ropes on the full"
6216,"SIX, just over the outstreched hand of Ankit Rajpoot at long leg. Just! Krunal went for the pull, didn't get all of it, dragged it off the bottom half and it eluded the fieldsman near the boundary ropes. Rajpoot kept his head still and flung himself backwards, but it fell tantalizingly past his fingertips"
6217,"SIX, nothing half-hearted about this. Picked the length (short) early and deposited this over wide long-on with an air of nonchalance. Typical Krunal"
6218,"FOUR, half-volley, keep 'em coming screams Krunal's willow. Just leans forward slightly and creams it off the middle wide of mid-off"
6219,"SIX, becoming too predictable is bowler Patel. The last four balls have been over 100ks. This one's no different either; KP did the smart thing, gave himself room outside off by jumping to the leg-side and tonked this into the cow corner stands with a mighty swing of the bat"
6220,"SIX, KP is upping the ante now. A risky shot, but he generated enough power to clear the ropes. A 76-metre six. Short ball wide of KP's off-stump, he fetches from there and hacks the pull over long-on. Manoj Tiwary was interested for a bit, but that was always travelling"
6221,"FOUR, sloppy work from Finch. A crisp drive to the left of mid-off, Finchy was late to react and hence the dive came in late, gets some hand on it, but ends up parrying it to the fence"
6222,"FOUR, full on the pads, CYA TOMOteamOW! KP was quick to pounce, just needed to help the ball and he did that with some ease, past square leg with courtesy a magical wristwork"
6223,"out Caught by Rajpoot!! Deceived him with the slower short ball there. It never arrived. Krunal decided to go for the pull and he fails to arrest the momentum, ends up feeding the top-edge and offers a dolly of a catch to Rajpoot at short fine. batsman c Rajpoot b bowler 32(23) [4s-1 6s-2]"
6224,"FOUR, cross-seamer, fuller and wider of off, KP manages enough contact on the rash drive and the edge flies wide of the keeper"
6225,"FOUR, another wild swing and another edge. Looped up and kept third man interested for a while, Yuvi with the dive to his left, but he fails to flick the ball back into play"
6226,"SIX, a 22-ball fifty for KP. He pumps his fists and lets out all the excitement. It was full and right in his swinging arc, KP gets underneath that and launches it many-a-mile over long-off"
6227,"out Caught by Finch!! Skipper strikes! Lovely stuff from Ash, didn't get great turn on this but ensured there's no pace and made KP fetch for that by tossing it far of off-stump; KP made room and went hard with his flat-bat swing, straight into the pocket of Finchy at wide long-on. batsman c Finch b bowler 50(23) [4s-5 6s-3]"
6228,"out Caught by Axar!! Poor shot selection from Ben batsman. Carrom ball bowled wide of off-stump, batsman drags the slogsweep from there and hits it straight to the man at deep mid-wicket. Axar trundles forward and gobbles it with ease. batsman c Axar b bowler 4(7)"
6229,"SIX, batsman's known for this; hitting biggies at will. Stoops to one knee and gives it a full monty on the slogsweep, found the middle and off she goes. Into the mid-wicket stands"
6230,"out Caught by Ashwin!! Third fourth wicket haul in four games for bowler. He is increasing the gap for the leading wicket takers tally. Pitched the ball short and got it to grip off the surface, it kept decking away from Hardik's reach, he slapped hard and got a thick toe-edge to short third man. batsman c Ashwin b bowler 9(12)"
6231,"FOUR, full toss wide of off-stump, batsman thrashes it powerfully square on the off-side. No-one there and it's a boundary"
6232,"FOUR, seam-up short ball wide of off-stump, batsman waits and opens the bat face to ramp it over short third. Smart batting"
6233,"FOUR, lovely shot, too short from bowler, Suryakumar swivels across, rolls his wrists and pulls it past square leg, no one in the deep and it's a boundary - Suryakumar's second of the night"
6234,"SIX, top-edge and six, Suryakumar was done in by the bouncer, was clearly late on the pull, gets a fat top-edge that sailed over the ropes at fine leg"
6235,"SIX, lovely shot, back-to-back sixes for Suryakumar and he was in complete control here. This was the slower ball from bowler, Suryakumar gets forward and thumps it over mid-off, went sailing over the ropes for another maximum"
6236,"FOUR, cheeky and four, back of a length and just outside off, Suryakumar waits on it, lets the ball come onto him and then defltly glides it past the keeper, third man was square and has no chance, 21 from the over"
6237,"out Bowled!! Brilliant from Tye and he has his 21st wicket of IPL 2018. This is deception at its very best, the knuckle ball, pitched around off and seamed back into the left-hander, the length drew batsman into an expansive drive, the gap between bat and pad was created, the ball snuck through and the off-stump went for a walk. batsman b bowler 9(7) [6s-1]"
6238,"FOUR, edged and four, unlucky for the bowler, on a good length and a hint of seam away from the left-hander, drew Kishan into the drive and found a thick edge, past the lone slip and races away to the fence"
6239,"SIX, massive, too short and the angle worked against Mohit here, Kishan swivels across, doesn't bother to keep the ball down and sends it soaring into the second tier - way over backward square leg for a maximum"
6240,"SIX, back-to-back sixes for Kishan, came charging down the track, Mohit went full and wide of off, Kishan was committed to the drive, gets it off the outside half and still has enough to sail over the ropes - at deep backward point"
6241,"out Caught by Stoinis!! Kishan's streaky innings comes to an end and it's that man - Tye, who takes the wicket once again. This was another knuckle ball that angled across the left-hander, Kishan was looking to heave it over mid-wicket, doesn't cover for the angle, gets it high on the bat and spoons it over mid-on. Stoinis was the fielder there - he kept his eyes on the ball as he back tracked and completed a simple catch. batsman c Stoinis b bowler 20(12) [4s-1 6s-2]"
6242,"out Caught by Rahul!! Back to back wickets and Tye is on fire. This was short and just outside off, Suryakumar was looking to help it on its way with a flap pull, gets a big inside edge that pops up off his knee-roll. KL runs forward and completes the catch, silence at the Wankhede as Tye scalps his 23rd victim of the season, he's on a hat-trick as well. batsman c Rahul b bowler 27(15) [4s-3 6s-2]"
6243,"out Caught by Yuvraj!! Another low score for batsman, he's been undone by the short ball once again. This was banged in short and just outside off, skidded through and hurried batsman with pace, he was in a terrible position as he pulled, got a top-edge and all he managed to do was to find Yuvraj at mid-on. He accepts the chance gleefully and his reaction suggests how pumped up he's for this match. The customary check for the front-foot no-ball and bowler is fine on that count. Off he goes, batsman. batsman c Yuvraj b bowler 6(10)"
6244,"FOUR, beautifully played, this should give batsman some confidence, back of a length and wide of off, batsman stands tall andc punches it in front of square on the off-side, beats cover and races away to the fence"
6245,"no run, dropped first ball! What a beginning that would've been to the game. Straight in and straight out. Deepak Hooda at short cover who got both hands and then it went out. Was a fairly straightforward chance too. Driven in the air and batsman gets lucky"
6246,"FOUR, what a shot to get off the mark. batsman on the walk, trying to get ahead of bowler and prove his superiority over him. Converts a length ball into a half-volley and drives it wide of mid-off, superb shot and all along the ground, lovely way to get going and a statement made by batsman"
6247,"out Caught by S Kaul!! Top edge and gone. batsman wasn't going to die wondering. He was going to play his shots, here he pays the price, short of length on the stumps with steepling bounce, batsman gets a fat top edge and third man takes a good catch. That was a skier and not easy under the lights. But Kaul hangs on. bowler strikes in the first over. batsman c S Kaul b bowler 1(4)"
6248,"FOUR, like Kohli batsman too gets off the mark with a boundary. Fraction short around off, batsman makes room and cuts wide of point. Expertly placed and it raced away"
6249,"FOUR, this is how he started against Nadeem. Went bang bang. This is a top top shot. bowler loops it up on the stumps, batsman gets forward and opens his body to go inside out over extra cover. That's trademark AB"
6250,"SIX, batsman is dealing in sixes. bowler has a wry smile on his face. Down the track and to the pitch before lofting this clean over long-off. The fielder was just a spectator"
6251,"FOUR, how good is batsman. Unbelievably good. Was a back of a length delivery around off, batsman pummelled the cut and left the sweeper with no chance. The fielder just had to cover a little distance but gave up as it rocketed to the fence"
6252,"FOUR, now pulls regally and gets to fifty. Is this the knock that will win team the game tonight? Was a length ball on the stumps, powerfully hit wide of deep mid, again one bounce over the ropes and the fielder was left helpless"
6253,"SIX, batsman is taking all his frustration at not being selected for the Test side against the team bowlers. He was a sureshot selection last year at this time, not anymore. This short ball is at batsman's chest, he plays a smashing pull high into the deep square leg stands. That was meaty"
6254,"FOUR, batsman gets to his maiden fifty. Gets a hug from de Villiers. Kohli punches the air in delight. They are happy for him and rightly so. What a time to come to the party. Low full-toss, sliced in the air but in the gap as well"
6255,"FOUR, only he can execute this shot with so much success. Sits down and moves across even before the ball has come out of the bowler's hand. It is a slower delivery on the stumps, batsman waits and pulls over short fine"
6256,"SIX, that has gone out of the Chinnaswamy! And might have landed on something or someone outside the ground. What's AB's reaction - stoic! Again his trademark shot, sit down, move across, a juicy full-toss and it has been sent over the deep backward square leg roof. A souvenir for someone to take home. Chants of ""AB"" echo around the ground as the players wait for a fresh cherry. Meanwhile AB and Moeen Ali have some refreshments"
6257,"FOUR, he doesn't want the wide, he wants more. Sits almost as he connects, back knee on the ground, reaches out to a slower delivery outside off, carves it over backward point. That's enough. Had he left that, it was a wide"
6258,"SIX, it has gone for six. A checked loft. Are you serious? Dhawan can only smile wryly, as it loops over his head. bowler deceived batsman completely, with a slower delivery outside off, batsman arrested his shot at the last moment, but it just flew and flew"
6259,"out Caught by Dhawan!! bowler has done the double over AB this season. Got him both times. This wicket the credit has to go to Dhawan. What a catch under extreme pressure. Could mean a difference of 30 easily. batsman slogs and doesn't get the elevation, Dhawan at deep backward square was on the edge, but leapt at the right time, caught it and ensured that the left leg didn't trod on the cushion. He raises his finger Ricky Ponting Sydney style to say it's out. Kohli is anxious and cranes his neck out to check whether this is a legal catch. It is and batsman walks. Again silence at the Chinnaswamy. 150th wicket for Rashid in T20s. batsman c Dhawan b bowler 69(39) [4s-12 6s-1]"
6260,"FOUR, from round the wicket, tossed up and batsman has smote it back over bowler's head. Flat hit and bisects long-off and long-on. Super shot. He is continuing his stroke-making"
6261,"out Caught by Goswami!! Brain-melt from batsman. Nothing more than that. Suddenly he has kicked the door wide open for team to come back into the game. bowler's last over and with AB gone, he decides to play a cute reverse paddle, when he was hitting them so well straight down the ground. Such a low-percentage shot and one must applaud Goswami's take. On the rebound and it was a clear deflection too. batsman walked as soon as Goswami took it. That shot could potentially send team out of the tournament. But batsman plays that way and has got out many times previously very softly. Fantastic innings nonetheless. batsman c Goswami b bowler 65(34) [4s-2 6s-6]"
6262,"FOUR, thick outside edge and four. Wide full delivery outside off, batsman's edge flies over short third"
6263,"SIX, right up there and batsman has teed off. Full on the stumps, batsman lofts and clears long-off. He can time them really well too"
6264,"SIX, does loft over extra-cover really well. Bit of air outside off, batsman launches bowler inside out and gets the maximum. Good end to the over"
6265,out Caught by Dhawan!! The slower delivery does the trick. Dhawan takes it at long-off and does his trademark thigh-slap. Would make a good South Indian hero in movies. With that move of his. batsman getting under that slower delivery a bit too much. Dhawan does the rest. batsman c Dhawan b bowler 4(6)
6266,"SIX, high high and over the backtracking Rashid at deep mid. That was a misjudgement from the Afghan. He was inside the field of play and not at the edge of the boundary. So can't track back in time and it lobs him despite getting his hands across to try and catch. One more biggie to batsman"
6267,"FOUR, Basil T is having a mare out there. KW - the cool cat - just rubs his beard. That's his way of showing disappointment. Cut late by batsman and Basil diving to his right at short third allowed the ball to sneak under his hands. One becomes four"
6268,"SIX, that is brute power from CdG. Brutal from the Zimbawean-turned-Kiwi. Waited for the slower delivery and then slapped it high and powerfully over extra-cover. Kohli smiles and claps"
6269,"FOUR, my colleague Kumar who dines and drinks on stats tells me this - bowler now has the most expensive figures this IPL. Not a proud record if you are the youngster. Good shot, full delivery on off, batsman opened the bat face and that's why he could find the gap with the square-drive wide of the fielder in the deep"
6270,"SIX, last match they had a fielder just behind the keeper, very fine and he was caught. Not this time. Just reverse-laps a full-toss and it goes all the way. The team dugout love it. batsman is known to be innovative and he is showing us why"
6271,"2 runs, that has gone into the stars and come back down, KW drops it. Gaping open mouths from the team fans. Who are enjoying the Schadenfreude. A slower delivery is skied miles up, miles literally, KW was setting himself at around mid-off, got both hands, out it went. Sarfaraz Khan dives and makes it back to prevent the run-out opportunity"
6272,"out Caught by Rashid Khan!! Has to go as one of the best catches in the IPL this season. On par with Boult. So similar. One-handed and behind him too. A pure reflex effort from Rashid at deep mid. Takes it and falls flat on the ground, can't believe has plucked that out of thin air. That was hit so powerfully and flat by batsman, but Rashid pulled off a blindy! batsman c Rashid Khan b bowler 40(17) [4s-1 6s-4]"
6273,"2 runs, good effort by Sandeep, but he has dropped batsman at long-stop! Ran in and got there, but the ball went out. A thick top edge on the pull and batsman almost gets out in the same fashion for the second game running"
6274,"FOUR, one-handed back foot square drive. On a short of length outside off, batsman didn't intentionally pull the bottom hand off, but it raced off the middle and split cover-point and backward point. AB is in the mood tonight"
6275,"FOUR, superb shot. The crowd go wild. So cleanly struck too. On a length and around off, lifted over extra-cover. A proper cricketing shot"
6276,"FOUR, batsman has played his part. Whips a full-toss on the stumps wide of backward square and it raced away. Grand end to the innings and he walks back with a swagger. team end on 218"
6277,"FOUR, he is looking to play aggressively and maximise the powerplay. This is tossed up outside off, batsman moves across and slog-sweeps over mid-wicket, one bounce over the ropes. Lovely batting"
6278,"FOUR, short and pulled over mid-wicket. Judged the length so quickly, left deep square chasing shadows. Top shot"
6279,"out Bowled!! The team fans are stunned into deathly silence. Deathly. While bowler celebrates with a finger-twirling celebration. batsman doesn't pick bowler, slogs in hope to a googly which is bowled on a fuller length and sees the stumps re-arranged. Difficult to say whether bowler has the wood over batsman - a very small sample size for that. But for sure Rashid has the bragging rights over the team skipper. batsman was so disappointed at missing that. Rarely does he miss those, but tonight he did. Massive massive wicket too. batsman b bowler 12(11) [4s-2]"
6280,"FOUR, not sure whether it is four or six. batsman grits his teeth and it is not a six. Maybe AB thought it didn't go all the way. It has been sent upstairs. Has the ball landed bang on the cushion? After batsman lifted a length ball on the stumps towards wide long-on. Still looking. Umpire Chettithody Shamsuddin wants to get this absolutely correct in the third ump's box. They are zooming in and zooming out. Crowd keep waiting. S Ravi does too. To get the orders from above. They could have taken the strategic timeout and got done with it. More than 3 minutes as I type. Finally a decision has been made. It is four. And it is the right call too, one angle showed clearly that the ball bounced in front of the cushions. The game moves on - thankfully"
6281,"FOUR, not sure what bowler is appealing for? Clearly off the bat as batsman reverse-swept and got a bottom edge, also batsman had got outside the line when playing the shot, beats short third and it raced away"
6282,"SIX, batsman launches bowler over long-off. Was right in the slot to play the lofted drive, hit it cleanly and went all the way. bowler came round the wicket and bowled a loosener, paid the price"
6283,"SIX, this is a fine shot. He has a problem with the short ones, much like Raina, but not at that height, at waist-height, he pulls handsomely and sends the white Kookaburra over the deep square leg's head. That shot brings the crowd back to life"
6284,"FOUR, his eyes were wide open as bowler was running in, maybe he was waiting for the short ball. Murdered through mid-wicket. That's actually so disrespectful to a fast bowler, but this is a tough game"
6285,"SIX, caught by Shikhar Dhawan but goes over the rope. Six more. batsman powered this flat and over the head of Dhawan at long-on, he caught it well but went one step back and trod on the cushion. Still manages a wry smile and a ""ooooohhhhhhh"""
6286,"SIX, so easy. Overpitched by bowler and he sees the white ball fly over long-on. Clean bat-flow and sweetly struck. A welcome bowler won't like"
6287,"SIX, it has gone for six despite it coming off the bottom of the bat. Again a bit too full from bowler, in the hitting range and batsman tees of. Over long-on"
6288,"SIX, fractionally short outside off, batsman stays low and shuffles across, gets under it and pulls it flat to deep mid-wicket. Goes just over the rope for six. Magnificent hitting."
6289,"FOUR, slower one @117km/h, batsman waits for it, calm as a cucumber (maybe change the idiom to Dhoni), steers it away to deep backward point for four"
6290,"2 runs, 8th fifty for KW this IPL, his 11th IPL fifty in his 28th game. Flat and shortish, whipped away off the back foot to deep mid-wicket for a brace"
6291,"SIX, in the slot, a bit of air too, batsman gets on his knees, and puts all his might into that slog-sweep over deep mid-wicket for six. Didn't seem to time that perfectly, managed to clear it. How does he look elegant while slogging? 50 partnership is up, and it almost hits a car."
6292,"FOUR, not even close to a half-tracker, just outside off, uses those beautiful wrists and splits that gap surgically behind backward point for four. Class. Yes, even T20 can be classy."
6293,"SIX, this guy is amazing! Not a T20 player, they said. Short one outside off, drags that with a pull over deep mid-wicket for a massive six. He's carting sixes on his way to a win."
6294,"FOUR, anti-climactic end to a superb effort. Put in a pool like dive at deep mid to get to it. But then kept sliding and the ball slipped away. Just touched the ropes and their was dismay on the face of the skipper. The short ball was thumped away between mid-wicket and long-on by the batsman"
6295,"FOUR, low full toss, dipping and the batsman clips the ball away past deep square leg for a four. That was superb from batsman as he gets it away"
6296,"SIX, low full toss and batsman goes one step better compared to his mate. That has been drop-kicked over deep square for a maximum. The runs are raining now. team ducking for cover but no where to hide"
6297,"SIX, gargantuan! More height and enough distance. That was on a length and the batsman dismisses it over long-on for a sixer. Only 67 now off 30 balls as 22 is leaked in that over"
6298,"FOUR, drags the ball short, bad ball and put away. The batsman decides to drag the pull behind square and gets it past the man at 45 degrees for a four. team would take it"
6299,"2 runs, fifty of the partnership comes up as Pandey comes back for a brace again. That was on the sticks again, might have been the quicker ball and the batsman turned the ball away between long-on and deep mid for a brace. 55 off the last four overs."
6300,"SIX, bowler misses the mark and pays the price. batsman dances across his sticks, exposes all of it and picks the ball over fine leg for a sixer. That was smart, not from the bowler though"
6301,"FOUR, slower ball, batsman waits till eternity and upper steers the ball over short third man for a four. 10 off the first two balls. Pressure back on team and bowler as Kohli tries to egg his bowler on"
6302,"FOUR, slippery conditions or too casual was CDG? The batsman biffed the full and wide ball over the bowler. The man at long-on did the slide well but the ball bobbled away after hitting the torso. Pressure is doing all the talking now. 31 needed now"
6303,"FOUR, mid-off inside the circle and the batsman gets under the fullish ball to nail it over mid-off. That is something team would take with open arms"
6304,"FOUR, four to end! The drama continues. 20 to get in the last over. That was full, more of a half-volley as he missed the mark and the batsman brought all his sinews to play. Muscled past long-off, to his left for a four"
6305,"out Caught by de Grandhomme!! The swirler has been taken at deep fine leg, inches inside the fence. The batsman shuffled across the sticks and swept the ball away high up in the air. The ball went skywards and when it came down, it had a nervous Kiwi under it. The fielder took it really away from his body. He was inches inside the fence though and that played on his mind. batsman c de Grandhomme b bowler 81(42) [4s-7 6s-5]"
6306,"1 run, dropped! How many dropped catches tonight? And second drop for the skipper. The length ball was delivered for the batsman to send it to the moon. But the batsman lifted it up without any distance for the man at long-off to come in but he dropped it"
6307,"FOUR, Siraj is the man at mid-on. Last over it was AB, they changed and the pacer allows the ball to miss his hand on the dive, wristily flicked wide of mid-on. Credit to Siraj for the run and dive, but the ball bounced over the hand"
6308,"SIX, that's a top shot. Granted it was overpitched on middle, but what wrist-work from batsman, nonchalantly whipped it flat and cleared deep mid. That is a statement of authority"
6309,"SIX, smashed for six. Was a length ball and he picked his spot, rocked back and sent it into the crowd at deep mid-wicket. bowler is welcome with a biggie"
6310,"no run, dropped by Kohli diving at mid-on. Dove too far actually. Ended up hitting his wrist. Drilled by batsman and the team skipper got both hands and spilled it. Isn't happy with himself at all"
6311,"SIX, the next ball goes for six. Length ball on the stumps, batsman heaves and clears deep mid. Just. But that will do"
6312,out Caught&Bowled!! It is bowler makes the breakthrough. Soft dismissal it must be said. Down the track and chipped back to the bowler. Who throws the ball away in delight. Wakes the crowd up who were starting to get restless. batsman c and b bowler 18(15) [6s-2]
6313,"FOUR, that has to be the softest stroke played to get a four this IPL. Unreal actually. Too full and batsman got forward before wristing it wide of a diving Southee at mid-on. Placed expertly and the ball kissed the turf along its way to the fence. Delightful from KW"
6314,"FOUR, the last ball goes for four. Dragged down and batsman lapped it over short fine's head. Needed to get enough bat to clear the fielder and did so. Poor end to the powerplay for team"
6315,"out Caught by de Villiers!! No way. He didn't just do that. It's all about the Avengers now, but AB is the only one keeping team alive. A toss-up outside off, batsman gets down the wicket and bottom-hand swats that flat towards deep mid-wicket, seems to have cleared it till the last moment until Superman arrives from Krypton to pluck that out of thin air. Leaps and grabs that one-handed. Absolutely ridiculous. The right foot was in fact extremely close to the rope and he landed on the right foot and had enough balance at the age of 34 to hold on and he was dancing like a teenager. Absolute magic. batsman c de Villiers b bowler 37(24) [4s-2 6s-3]"
6316,"FOUR, a tad short and angling into the body, batsman shuffles across and guides the pull to backward square leg where Sarfraz misfields and lets it through for four"
6317,"FOUR, short and wide outside off, batsman gets down the wicket and slaps that over deep extra cover for four"
6318,"FOUR, flat delivery, skidding, batsman gets low and swat-sweeps that to deep square leg for four"
6319,"FOUR, tossed up outside off, pitched up, batsman comes forward and whips it between mid-wicket and long-on expertly for four. Elegance personified"
6320,"SIX, Wow! Tossed up, in the slot, batsman keeps a still head and golf-swings it through the line to deep mid-wicket for four. The most underrated of the big four, and he is proving his credentials today"
6321,"out Caught by Maxwell!! Oh, may I just say that could've hit a plane. A length ball on middle, batsman comes down the track and isn't quite to the pitch of it, gets it off the meat but gets the timing just wrong on the lofted whip which makes it gain more height than distance as Maxwell does phenomenally well to sight the ball and settles under it at deep mid-wicket. Lies out on the grass under the heavens, a relieved man. Made it look much easier than it actually was. That went a kilometer up in the air. batsman c Maxwell b bowler 50(29) [4s-4 6s-4]"
6322,"FOUR, vintage batsman! Tossed up outside off, batsman reaches out, gets to the pitch of it, and lofts that inside-out over extra cover for four"
6323,"FOUR, what amazing placement! Flat one just outside off, not short at all, batsman whips a cut between gully and backward point for four. Surgically bisected the field"
6324,"out Caught by Vijay Shankar!! Loopy googly on leg-stump, batsman predictably goes for his almighty heave over mid-wicket which has brought him much success over the years. Not tonight though as he flat-bats it straight down the throat of Vijay Shankar at cow corner. That's the end of a the most un-batsman innings of all time. An innings of more than ten balls, with a strike-rate below hundred. *Shaking my head* batsman c Vijay Shankar b bowler 15(18) [4s-1]"
6325,"out Caught by Abhishek Sharma! bowlerji wins the mind-game. Leg-break just a tad wide outside off, batsman goes for an ill-advised sweep trying to drag it into the on-side, gets a feeble top-edge that lobs into the hands of short fine leg. Mishy is pumped. batsman c Abhishek Sharma b bowler 1(5)"
6326,"SIX, googly on middle, batsman gets down the wicket and tonks it straight down the ground over the sightscreen! Full swing of the blade, >360 degrees, and it sails away for an 89 meter six"
6327,"out Caught by Shreyas Iyer!! And the mentalist fails to pull off the unfathomable tonight! Low full toss, batsman finally nails the timing on this with a bottom-hand whip, flat and fittingly straight the his opposite number at long-on. A sigh of relief for DD. batsman c Shreyas Iyer b bowler 17(23) [4s-1]"
6328,"SIX, first of all, kudos to the cameraman for following that one. Half-volley on middle, in the slot, batsman lofts it with every ounce of his power straight down the ground for six. That went through to the stratosphere and back into the sightscreen"
6329,"out Caught by Vijay Shankar! Half-volley on off, batsman swings through the line, once again gets far too much height and hardly any distance, holes out to Vijay Shankar running in from long-off. That ball must have little drops of heaven on it by now, the number of times it has crosses the earth's atmosphere tonight. batsman c Vijay Shankar b bowler 1(2)"
6330,"SIX, cannot bowl there to batsman, he'll feast on it. Banged short by bowler but it's not that high. Sits up nicely for the Australian who powers the pull over deep mid-wicket. One of Watto's favorite hitting zones"
6331,"FOUR, crashed away! He had been trying to blast it for a while and finally, connects. Wide half-volley and batsman's quick hands on display as he thumps this with all his power. Well wide of mid-off who was a mere spectator"
6332,"SIX, clears the fence! batsman has looked really fidgety, trying to hit too hard and connects here. On a shortish length and he was across the stumps in a flash. Pumps it over deep square leg with a meaty strike"
6333,"FOUR, blasted away. Avesh needs to be careful with his lengths here. Errs on the shorter side once more and batsman gets across to blast it over mid-wicket. Just on the bounce before crashing into the ad hoardings"
6334,"SIX, it's gone all the way! batsman is taking a liking to Avesh. Charges down the track and knows that the length will be shortened. Adjusts to pull it over deep mid-wicket. Easily over the ropes"
6335,"SIX, third maximum of the over! batsman has gone bonkers. Walks down the track and makes room as well, Avesh continues to err on the shorter side and this disappears as well. Way into the crowd at cow corner"
6336,out Caught by Boult!! The old warhorse has broken through for DD. Must say that this was on the cards with batsman really struggling to get going. Needed a move on and perishes in the process. The leg break from bowler and invites the Australian to slog against the turn. Risky shot when there is some spin and it skews high off the outer half towards long-off. Boult ain't dropping those. batsman c Boult b bowler 14(23) [6s-1]
6337,"no run, dropped! Oh, Pant! He would be gutted not to have held onto this one. What a moment it would have been for DD! The slider which goes across batsman with the angle, he pushed with hard hands and got a tiny feather, it went rapidly to the left of Pant and smacked him on the leg. Tough one, but goes down as a chance"
6338,"FOUR, full, gives it a bit of air outside off, in the slot for batsman, who shimmies down, makes a bit of room, and punches that through deep extra cover for four"
6339,"SIX, straight down the ground! The pressure builds, bowler bowls a full-toss on middle and off, batsman nimble down the track and clubs that straight down the ground into the sightscreen"
6340,"1 run, full and flighted outside off, batsman gets forward and pushes to mid-off, takes off for a risky run, and Maxi is quick to fire in the throw to the non-striker's end. batsman was gone if that had hit. Not even in the frame! Where was bowler?"
6341,"FOUR, very quick, almost yorker length on leg, misses by half an inch perhaps, and batsman shuffles across to tickle it away to fine leg for four"
6342,"1 run, another full one on off-and-middle, and a punch from the crease to long-on for a single, to bring up yet another 50 for batsman in this IPL. He's knocked the door down to get into the Indian side, and his batting epiphany continues"
6343,"FOUR, Shaw opens his account with a boundary. A shortish ball that's picked early by the batsman. Gets into a good position and pulls it over square leg. Good shot"
6344,out Bowled!! Knocked him over. An ordinary shot from the DD captain. It was bowled at 139.5kph and Iyer was backing away to cut. It was neither short nor wide. A skiddy short of length delivery on off. Iyer can't make contact and the ball crashes into the off-pole. Beaten for pace. The partnership has been broken. batsman b bowler 19(22) [4s-3]
6345,"out Caught by Dwayne Bravo!! Two wickets within a span of four balls. Ngidi sports a bright smile. A pacy short of length delivery slanted across the left-handed batsman, batsman tries to fetch it from outside off and heave over the leg-side. The edge flies and settles into the safe hands of Bravo at third man. And, of course, the jig follows it. batsman c Dwayne Bravo b bowler 38(26) [4s-3 6s-2]"
6346,"FOUR, that's been hammered. A half-volley, batsman stands tall and drills it straight down the ground. Bravo, in his followthrough, moves away from it. Rockets away to the fence"
6347,"out Bowled!! Horrible shot! Not the first time this season that batsman has departed playing an atrocious stroke. Here is another example of it. The previous ball sowed the seeds of doubt in his mind and he went for a reverse sweep. Except that this was a dart from bowler aimed at middle and leg. 'You miss, I hit' type and it crashes into the stumps. Perhaps was too full for the stroke as well. Either ways, poor dismissal. batsman b bowler 5(7)"
6348,out Caught by Harbhajan!! Another one bites the dust. No heroics tonight from batsman after his impressive debut the other night. Sharp bumper from Thakur and the southpaw is rushed into the pull. Only manages a fat top edge that bobbles high towards mid-on. Bhajji settles under it merrily. DD have lost half their side now. batsman c Harbhajan b bowler 2(4)
6349,"FOUR, that's a freebie and Shankar puts it away. Shortish and sliding down leg, he just walks across a bit and deflects it well wide of Dhoni with a neat glance. Races away to the fine leg fence"
6350,"FOUR, handy blow from Patel. He does pack a punch in his shots, as we saw during his batting promotion earlier this season. This is fractionally short and there is a lot of width as well, he waits for it and slaps hard past extra cover. Once it beat the infield, it was always racing to the fence"
6351,"SIX, that's deep into the crowd! Plenty of power from batsman on this stroke. He's smoked it away. Short of a length and he is now expecting this length. Sits deep in the crease to clobber the pull away by standing tall. Meaty blow"
6352,"SIX, for a moment Rayudu at fine leg thought he had a chance as he raced to his left but this cleared the square leg fence. Fuller ball on middle and off, Patel just went across to play the pick up shot. Quick hands and supple wrists on the drop kick from Patel as this whistled away"
6353,"SIX, hugeeeeeeeeee! Bravo decides not to bowl the slower ball and it disappears. Fullish and in the slot, lots of pace and it's in the arc as well. Patel does the needful by bludgeoning it way over long-on. Handy blows, these, for DD"
6354,"SIX, there goes another! Bravo's death bowling issues this season continue. Is being taken to the cleaners tonight as well. Slower but it's on the shorter side, Shankar gets hold of it and pulls it away over deep backward square leg"
6355,"SIX, this is fantastic hitting from batsman. He is being aided by some poor bowling too. Half-volley and it's a pacy ball, Patel drills it dead straight down the ground. Into the sightscreen for another maximum"
6356,"SIX, bowler errs and Shaw pounces. Shortens the length and angles one on middle and leg, Shaw gets into a good position with a slight shuffle and shoves it over mid-wicket. Goes all the way"
6357,"SIX, 26 off the final over! Just the momentum push DD were seeking and they've finished with a flourish here. Bravo loses the plot completely to dish out a juicy full toss, Harshal in this hitting mood isn't going to miss out. Goes straight once again with the loft and once more, crashes into the sightscreen for a maximum"
6358,"1 run, a drop! Shardul Thakur is the culprit. Shaw once again kneels down to employ the slog sweep against an in-dart. Mistimed and went to the right of mid-on, where Thakur leapt and couldn't snaffle"
6359,"out Caught by SN Thakur!! Thakur doesn't drop it this time. A simple catch, and he will be a relieved man. A short of a length delivery around off, Shaw loading his back foot decided to hoick over cow corner. Gets it off the bottom part of the bat and the ball settles into the hands of the long-on fielder. Thakur moved to his right and reverse-cvupped it. Way too many high risk shots from Shaw. batsman c SN Thakur b bowler 17(17) [4s-1 6s-1]"
6360,"no run, Thakur, again. A direct hit would have been curtains for Pant! The run was definitely not on. Iyer slightly backed away and bowler followed him with a short of length ball, thereby cramping him for room. It was punched towards mid-on. A yes-no situation and Pant put in a desperate dive. Luckily, the fielder failed to hit the target"
6361,"FOUR, shot! Backed away, manufactured room and then slapped this short ball over backward point. Once bounce and into the fence"
6362,"FOUR, cheeky! bowler bangs one short, Iyer waits for the ball, hops and elevates it over the slip cordon. There is no one to stop that"
6363,"FOUR, Thakur bowls a short ball, no venom. And batsman takes full toll of it. Swivel-pulls it fiercely in front of square leg for a boundary"
6364,"FOUR, the gap is found. bowler shortens his length and serves a bit of width, Iyer stays back in his crease and cuts it to pierce the gap between short third man and backward point. Superb placement"
6365,"FOUR, short, wide, turning away, batsman, who was initially pressing forward, goes deep in the crease and scythes it through covers. Powerfully hit"
6366,"SIX, that's one helluva shot! From round the wicket, bowler doles out a leg-stump half-volley, batsman goes slightly leg-side and clouts it over deep mid-wicket. Way into the stands. Absolutely pummeled"
6367,"FOUR, short-and-wide outside off, asking to be punished. batsman stays back in his crease and cuts it fiercely between short third man and backward point"
6368,"SIX, how did that go for a six? Did Ngidi misjudge that? He ran forward from long-off and then had to come back again. Jumps up in the end, but in vain. Coming to the shot, batsman wasn't targeting that region. He got down to slog over cow corner. The ball ballooned up off the top-edge and just cleared the ropes"
6369,"SIX, how good is that? Pacy short delivery and at the body, what does batsman do? He just ramps it for six. Using the bat as a help, periscope style. I guess it is Baz who caught that? in the team dugout. No my colleague - Nikhil tells me Baz has dropped it and he is right"
6370,out Stumped!! Loopy leggie and the batsman is stumped. Jumped out of the crease and tried to go aerial on the off-side but missed it by a mile. Beaten in flight and the rest was done by the keeper. team are messing up the chase here. Third wicket for Gopal. The ball dipped on him and the preempted movement deserted him. batsman st Klaasen b bowler 3(4)
6371,"FOUR, sixth fifty for Mr. 360! That was shortish, the batsman jumped on the opportunity and muscled the ball away past the dive from the man at deep square leg. Superb execution"
6372,"out Caught by Rahane!! Gone. team are impoding here. That was a typical leggie's dismissal. Landed outside off and turned away, lured the batsman for a drive to catch the edge. There was a slip fielder and the captain can give himself a pat on the back. For taking the catch and for having a slip in place. Superb bit of passage for team. Kohli looks on in shock and dismay. batsman c Rahane b bowler 2(3)"
6373,"out Stumped!! Game. Set. Match. That is a hugeeeeeeee wicket. The googly is misread. Looks to drive and misses it. The batsman tried to drive it but the ball bent in and the keeper did the rest as the back foot dragged out of the crease. Kohli is shocked. team camp cannot believe it. More than that, Gopal has hands on his mouth. He has shocked himself to a massive wicket. team all over team like a rash. One should compliment Klaasen for his sharp work, so quick with the gloves ala MSD. batsman st Klaasen b bowler 53(35) [4s-7]"
6374,"FOUR, slower ball and drop-kicked over mid-off. Played the drive on the up, did not intend to keep it down and got it over the head of the fielder for a four"
6375,"out Caught by Klaasen!! The fat lady's whisper can be heard. That was a terrific take from Klaasen. The slower delivery and the batsman backed away to steer the cut, the shot was not too away from the keeper, who leapt to his right and takes it. Superb day behind the sticks for the team keeper. First with the bat and now with the ball. team fans continue to wear a disappointed look. batsman c Klaasen b bowler 7(8) [4s-1]"
6376,"out Bowled!! Golden duck for Umesh. A taste of his own medicine. That was fuller, on a length and the batsman never covered the line of the ball. A little gap was found and the ball traverses between the bat and pad to strike timber. The team fans erupt. Early finish? Hat-trick ball coming up. batsman b bowler 0(1)"
6377,"FOUR, something to cheer for team fans. Short ball and has been pulled away into the on-side past deep square leg. He got hold of the short ball and muscled it away into the on-side"
6378,"FOUR, slaps the low full toss back at the bowler. Archer could not react in time to clasp that and the ball goes through his hands to race away to the long-off fence for a four. 44 off 18 balls is of academic interest. Or is it?"
6379,"FOUR, flogged away as he picked the slower delivery up like dead meat. Then muscled the ball away between deep mid and deep long-on to pick the bones out of it. batsman was deep in his crease and waiting for the slower ball"
6380,"out Caught by Gowtham!! Final nail in the coffin. Shortish, slower ball and the batsman heaved the pull away to be taken at cow corner. The batsman never connected properly and the mistimed hit was taken. team only a wicket away from staying in contention for a place in the play-offs. team's dreams are over. Well almost. batsman c Gowtham b bowler 14(17) [4s-2]"
6381,"leg byes, 1 run, that was a comedy of errors? The yorkerish delivery was missed by the batsman and was hit on the boot. It was going down leg and the bowler kept on appealing. Number 10 and Jack decided to steal a single and they did. The keeper could not manage to throw the sticks down at the bowler's end, else it could have been tight"
6382,"FOUR, reverse paddle and gets the ball away past short third man. That was on the sticks and the batsman got it away amidst an appeal from the bowler"
6383,"out Caught by Gowtham!! What just happened there? A relay catch! Kohli looks bemused. The length ball and the batsman slogged it away to send it skywards. Samson came charging in and dropped it, but the ball popped up. But Gowtham, who almost collided with his mate kept his wits and took it low and one-handed. Tremendous reflexes after the ball ricocheted off Samson's palm. batsman c Gowtham b bowler 14(12) [4s-2]"
6384,"SIX, six again. An action replay of the first six. Just that Baz didn't drop it in the dugout. Using the pace of bowler to a nicety. Expensive over from the Bajan"
6385,"out Bowled!! batsman is bowled to a spinner. Seen that so often in this IPL. I can recollect Mujeeb, Rashid and now bowler. The bowler does a cool fist pump to celebrate the wicket. batsman knew he had to do something against bowler, struggled in the first over, and decided to step out, but cleverly bowled by bowler, going wide of the crease and darting in a fast offie, which breaks in through the bat-pad gap to take batsman's off stump out. They check for the no-ball on the side crease, but bowler had his leg up in the air and didn't land. A body blow to team. batsman b bowler 4(9)"
6386,"FOUR, batsman is away. How easy he makes it look. Pacy short ball on the hips, he just whipped that wide of short fine, and bowler is bowling in the high 140s. Only a genius can do things that batsman does"
6387,"FOUR, wow. Wow. What a front foot punch that is. Just a checked punch and look at the ball race away. Extra-cover was wide open and it raced away"
6388,"FOUR, bowler ends another expensive over with a good length delivery on off and middle, flicked through mid-wicket, in the air but in the gap. He again looks in the mood today and that's bad news for team fans"
6389,"FOUR, again greatness from AB. Got close to the swinging slower knuckle ball, but used his bottom hand to great effect, squeezing down on it hard and beats mid-on to his left"
6390,"FOUR, batsman gets lucky. Sliced the slower delivery straight up but it had enough elevation to clear the short third man fielder. Came down the track and aimed to go over cover, was beaten by the angle across him"
6391,"FOUR, superb effort from Samson but he has dropped that and it has rolled to touch the cushions. Length ball on middle, heaved away towards deep mid, Samson was in from the boundary, backtracked and stuck his right hand up on the leap to catch, but it didn't stick. Would've been a competitor to Boult and Rashid Khan's catches had he hung on. Has a wry smile on his face"
6392,"FOUR, very full, batsman crunches a drive between extra cover and mid-off. Really hit it hard and gets another boundary"
6393,"FOUR, he got out against team playing this, but that was to an offie, this is a leggie, reverse-swept and well wide of backward point. bowler is welcomed with a boundary"
6394,"FOUR, Archer is having a nightmare today. Pulled to the left of him at deep mid, he got there and picked up the ball with his left-hand, then inadvartently the right-hand flicked the ball onto the cushions. Tried to scramble and pull the ball back with a dive, to no avail"
6395,"out Stumped!! batsman is walking. Because he knows that he has not got the back foot back inside. A toppie, from the front of the hand, slides on quicker, beats the backing away Patel on the cut, he overbalanced and when Klaasen whipped the bails off, the foot was on the line. Superb keeping from the South African as well. team needed that wicket. batsman st Klaasen b bowler 33(21) [4s-3 6s-2]"
6396,out Caught&Bowled!! batsman closes his eyes and grimaces. While bowler is being mobbed by his mates. A thick leading edge and bowler timed his leap to perfection and came up with the return catch in two hands. The catch was all about the leap. Two wickets in an over and the pressure multiplies many times on de Villiers. batsman c and b bowler 1(2)
6397,out Caught by Parthiv Patel!! Umesh Yadav strikes. The ploy to send Archer up the order hasn't worked. He's gone for a duck - third this season. A bumper down leg from Umesh and Archer goes for a pull - looked like a half-hearted one. Only manages a glove and Parthiv Patel snaffles it with ease. The teamians knew it straightaway and the umpire got it right too. batsman c Parthiv Patel b bowler 0(4)
6398,"2 runs, fine knock by Tripathi, his first one of this season. Gets a shortish delivery and has plenty of time to hook it away to deep square leg. As the fielder had to charge in to collect the ball, the batsmen managed to get the second two"
6399,"SIX, now he'll try to shift gears. Walks down the track and chips the length ball right over the bowler's head. Such sweet timing on this blow. For a moment I thought this was only a boundary, but no. It's a maximum!"
6400,"FOUR, the boundaries have started to flow. This was fired outside off, Tripathi came down the track and threw his hands at it. Gets a thick outside edge that flies down to the third man fence"
6401,"out Lbw!! The impact was marginal but enough to go against batsman. It was the off-cutter outside off, batsman moved inside and went for a wild heave. Got beaten and was struck on the pads. The umpire took his time to give his decision but in the end he's right. So, finally batsman' struggle comes to an end. Might be a blessing in disguise for the Royals. They need someone who can strike the ball well. batsman lbw b bowler 33(31) [4s-3]"
6402,"out Caught by Moeen Ali!! Two in two for Umesh. His third wicket of the match, he's on a roll in the past few games. Getting better with every game. Bowls a gentle length delivery first up and batsman flicks it straight to the man at short mid-wicket. A soft dismissal, indeed. Scored 90-odd against team earlier in the tournament, walks back for a duck today. batsman c Moeen Ali b bowler 0(1)"
6403,"no run, the review was retained and lucky for Royals as batsman survives. Decision has to be over-turned! Excellent delivery by Yadav though. He's on fire today. Bowls a full length delivery tailing into the batsman, almost a yorker and batsman manages to get an inside edge as he brings his bat down in time."
6404,"SIX, that's a massive blow. Nicely done. Was a tossed up delivery outside off, the batsman came down the wicket and went ahead with his loft, right over the bowler's head and over the ropes. The fielder at long-on was a mere spectator"
6405,"FOUR, that's the french cut. Short of a length around off, batsman goes at it with hard hands, pulls and ends up getting an inside edge. Past the off-stump and runs down to the fine leg boundary. Was very close to knocking down the off-pole"
6406,"FOUR, this is better. Will make him feel better, this shot. Makes room and punches the length delivery through extra-cover. No fielder in the deep as batsman collects his second boundary"
6407,"SIX, this is the class of batsman. This is what he can do. This was a full length delivery outside off, batsman frees his arms and carves it over third man. Beautiful shot!"
6408,"FOUR, improvisation at its best. This was a full toss outside off, batsman shuffles across and scoops this gift over short fine leg. On a bounce and into the fence she goes. Has quietly moved into the 30s"
6409,"out Caught by Moeen Ali!! bowler has the last laugh! Conceded a boundary and six earlier in the over but does well to get the better of the South African. Bowls a slower delivery outside off, batsman goes ahead with his aggressive loft and holes out at long-off. Moeen Ali won't drop those and he doesn't. batsman c Moeen Ali b bowler 32(21) [4s-3 6s-1]"
6410,"SIX, how often has he done that? Makes six hitting so simple, does batsman. Wonder why he wasn't sent to open the innings. This was a short delivery and the all-rounder simply pulled it over mid-wicket"
6411,"SIX, excellent shot! Full in length around off, batsman stands tall and pumps it over long-off. Back-to-back sixes for batsman and the crowd is lovin' it"
6412,"SIX, first maximum! Premeditated, but he made excellent contact. Flat ball wide of off, Tripathi gets down on a knee after moving towards off. Follows with a massive slog sweep over deep backward square leg"
6413,"out batsman Run Out!! An anti-climax to end the innings. A yorker outside off that's too quick for batsman to squeeze it out. They try to steal a bye but the keeper parries the ball to bowler who does the rest. team end on a competitive score, nevertheless. batsman run out (Parthiv Patel/bowler) 14(5) [6s-2]"
6414,"FOUR, good looking shot! Slightly on the shorter side, batsman treks back and opens his bat face to force it through point. Races away"
6415,"FOUR, shot! Offers a straight bat and lifts it downtown. Over and wide of the mid-on fielder. Slightly overpitched and batsman pounced"
6416,"FOUR, shortish ball, Tripathi was expecting that. Remains back in his crease and heaves it over mid-wicket. Didn't get it off the middle, but had enough wood on it to go for a boundary. 13 off Umesh's second over"
6417,"FOUR, nicely done! Didn't over-hit and relied on timing. Scrambled seam short of length delivery, on the stumps, batsman hops across and tucks it through square leg. No chance for the long leg fielder to cut it off"
6418,"FOUR, lovely shot! Tossed up delivery, Tripathi dances down the track and in the process backs away to manufacture room. And then, follows it up with a sweetly timed lofted inside-out shot over extra cover"
6419,"FOUR, now bowler overcorrects. Drags the length short on this leg-break and Tripathi was quick to latch onto it. Goes back in his crease and muscles the pull through mid-wicket"
6420,"1 run, short and wide outside off, Tripathi jumps and cuts to deep point. Brings up the 50-run stand between the duo"
6421,"1 run, Tripathi sees the width on this short of length delivery and punches on the rise. Falls short of backward point, where Mandeep dove forward. Collects and has a shy at the striker's end. Doesn't hit the target, Rahane would have been in anyway"
6422,"FOUR, he was in good shape when he made contact with the ball. Overpitched, Tripathi with a high-backlift lofts the drive over extra cover. No chance for long-off to stop that. High elbow and there's the pose for the photographs"
6423,"FOUR, room on offer and Lynn accepts gleefully! Frees his arms and flashes it past cover-point. Absolutely creamed"
6424,"FOUR, length and width, that's a harmful combo to serve in the powerplay; Lynn doesn't miss out. Pounces on it with a wielding willow and hits the gap with an air of authority"
6425,"FOUR, just over a leaping backward point! Just. Full and wide, batsman drills off the lower half and manages it get it just over the fielder. Lots of oohs and aahs"
6426,"FOUR, jumps down the pitch and squirts an inside edge on the cross batted swat, no-one in the deep at mid-wicket and he'll claim another boundary"
6427,"FOUR, that's not the area to be bowling, certainly not to Sunil batsman. He loves width and with the length full it only makes matters easy for him, pumps this over extra cover with ease"
6428,"SIX, that's just a blatant display of biceps. Comes on the front foot and scythes this length ball over cow corner. Trust me when I say this: it was hammered away disdainfully with a torso torque"
6429,"1 run, 50 run stand. bowler adjusts, bowling this arm-ball slow and full. To long-on for a single"
6430,"SIX, he's like a scoop of butter today. Reads the length so early that he has the time to get under a bowler darter. Lifts it over long-on"
6431,"FOUR, now uses the pace and splits short third man and backward point. Played that delightfully late, with a nice clean lean towards off-side"
6432,"out Caught by Manish Pandey!! Pandey's run in an arc at long-on and taken an in-out-in catch right at the boundary ropes. It's been referred upstairs, with the soft signal being out. It is out indeed. Just one of batsman's slogs that goes wrong. Hits it flat and across, seemed to have miscued it -- triggered by the lack of room -- and there Pandey was, running and plucking it out. Realizes he's going to run over the ropes, parries the throw in, hops out, hops back in and then almost steals that out of the hands of Rashid, who was lurking around. Rashid's hands cupped Pandey's -- so close. batsman c Manish Pandey b bowler 55(43) [4s-4 6s-3]"
6433,"SIX, top-edges are the new first aid in cricket. Didn't team need that. A back of a length delivery going down leg-side, DK was late on the slog-sweep and ushered a top-edge over fine leg. It was way into the crowd, trust me"
6434,"2 runs, a direct-hit from extra cover but Uthappa has made it back into the bowler's end with a sharp second. Squeeze-driven by DK that, as BK went full and wide"
6435,"FOUR, overpitched, and that's flying over batsman's scalp. Scooped away straight down the ground"
6436,"SIX, only fair that Rashid takes the brunt. It's outside off but it's enough for batsman. Enough full, enough close. Slogged over deep mid-wicket"
6437,"out Caught by Goswami!! bowler is riding a horse in celebration. Or something like that. He's undone batsman with a short ball. Weight not quite back, the bounce getting big on the batsman, and we have a top-edge, that the keeper runs around and collects it near say leg gully. batsman c Goswami b bowler 45(34) [4s-3 6s-2]"
6438,"FOUR, slower delivery sitting up, and the perils of having DK at the death. Hits the pull flat over the mid-wicket region. It's racing away.. it's a four!"
6439,"FOUR, that top-edge to fine leg has arrived, beaten Sandeep Sharma and run away for a boundary. Sandeep, running to his right, leapt in front, went two-handed but the ball just slid through, deflecting to the ropes. 13 needed, only"
6440,"out Caught by Manish Pandey!! Russell has been baited here. All he got until now was a barrage of incoming short balls, so he was going to want to take full toll of this one. Slogs across, totally misreading the slower delivery and offering a steepler to long-on. Manish had to come in a few paces but he was right under the ball. Brilliantly taken. batsman c Manish Pandey b bowler 4(4) [4s-1]"
6441,"FOUR, tries to bowl very full and wide from round the wicket but batsman's reached out to it. Throws his hands, slices it away, and it's been hit with power. Skittles away, beating Sandeep's dive. Scores level"
6442,"out Caught by Bhuvneshwar!! Now this finds the fielder. More like a hoick-pull that batsman's fallen to. Takes the short ball on, swivels into an attempted glory hit and succumbs to the placement of the fielder at fine leg. batsman c Bhuvneshwar b bowler 7(5) [4s-1]"
6443,"SIX, 20 off the over. team are making the most of the powerplay. Once again, it's in batsman's swinging territory, he clears his front leg and lifts the ball back over the bowler's head for a stunning maximum"
6444,"SIX, ah! That shoulder seems to functioning just fine. It was short and drifting into leg stump channels, Lynn clears the front leg and smokes it for a 69-metre maximum over mid-wicket"
6445,"FOUR, smart cricket from Lynny! Knuckle ball, Lynn had all the time in the world to pick his shot, makes room outside off and bludgeons it straight back over the bowler's head for a one-bounce four"
6446,"FOUR, half-tracker, the line doesn't matter, batsman rolls his wrists and slambangs it with a swivel pull down to deep square"
6447,"SIX, long-on jumped back in desperation, but he never looked like catching that. Clean swing of the willow from batsman, thumps it from middle-stump channel and deposits it way over the fence"
6448,"out Caught by Manish Pandey!! Not this time. Not again. batsman throws his head down in disappointment. Tried for a encore and failed to find the sweet-spot of the blade, enough air-time for Manish Pandey to run forward and claim a simple catch at long-off. batsman c Manish Pandey b bowler 29(10) [4s-4 6s-2]"
6449,"FOUR, smacks the ball and flexes his muscles. Doesn't move. Whoa, how's that for a confidence! Slightly fuller and wider of off, Lynn cracks it straight past mid-off"
6450,"FOUR, no-one at deep mid-wicket and Kaul bowls a rank bad ball. Short on middle, batsman swivels and crunches the pull over mid-wicket"
6451,"SIX, length ball in the channel, Lynn feasts on it with a mighty hoick over cow corner. 87-metres to be precise"
6452,"FOUR, that's a dream start from batsman, Rana dropped one short and just wide of off, batsman backed away and cracked it square past cover, no need to run for those"
6453,"FOUR, lashed over backward point, width on offer from Krishna and batsman cashed in big time. Reaches out and slaps it over point, a few bounces and over the ropes"
6454,"FOUR, was that a half-chance? Short and wide of off, batsman got on top of the bounce as he cut, didn't bother to keep it down, went to the right and well wide of Uthappa at backward point, the man in the deep has no chance"
6455,"SIX, ""That is what form does to you,"" says Harsha Bhogle on air. Kuldeep gives plenty of air, but it lands as a freebie for batsman. On the pads and he comfortably dispatches it over cow corner"
6456,"3 runs, in the airr and Narine puts it down. Never looked like taking it any point, to be honest. So much so that he didn't even get a hand to it. A fat leading edge as batsman closes the bat face early on the whip, goes very high into the night sky and took an eternity to descend. The ball was swirling and the West Indian grasses it. Collects the ball and fires a direct-hit at the striker's end, it riochets away and they pinch three runs. They went upstairs for the run-out check but batsman was well in"
6457,"SIX, this will hurt team. batsman can play this shot in his sleep. Lenght ball down leg, batsman gets inside the line and hacks it behind square for a maximum. Easy pickings"
6458,"SIX, make that two sixes in two balls for batsman. This was the shot he attempted against team in the previous game and picked out the fine leg fielder. This time he knew the fielder was inside the ring. Moved across his sticks early, stayed low and helped it supremely over the fielder's head for half-a-dozen"
6459,"out Caught by A Russell!! batsman could'nt have picked the fielder out any better. Surely, will be disappointed. Anyway, bowler retaliates and gets his revenge. Went wide of off, batsman slashed it hard and straight to deep cover. Russel was under it and he won't drop those. It was an off-pace ball and KW had to generate some power to elevate it over the fielder's head. 2 or 3 inches away from Russel, it would've been a boundary. Nonetheless, team will breathe a sigh of relief as they break this dangerous stand. batsman c A Russell b bowler 36(17) [4s-1 6s-3]"
6460,"1 run, buzz in the crowd as batsman reaches his fifty. 32nd IPL fifty for the southpaw, mind you he was averaging around 24 against team before this game. A flighted delivery just outside off and batsman thrashes it to long-off to bring up the milestone"
6461,"FOUR, two dots and Pandey breaks free. Employs his dexterous wrists - ala Dhoni. Full and just outside off, Pandey jumped back and wristed it beautifully to bisect long-on and deep mid-wicket"
6462,"FOUR, team have been very clumsy and poor in the field. Here's more evidence. Half-volley just outside off, Pandey slammed the drive wide of long-off and called ""Two"". Chawla was patrolling the fence and sprinted to his left, trips and loses his balance allowing the ball to roll away to the fence. Messy!"
6463,"out Lbw!! batsman is given OUT lbw, he's having a discussion with Pandey before eventually walking off. Krishna roars back strongly in his new spell after leaking 11 in his first over. Cuts back in from round the wicket, seemed like the slower ball. batsman was lining up for a mow across the line, misses it totally and is hit on the back thigh. Looked pretty adjacent and umpire S Ravi took his time before raising the dreaded finger. so, batsman falls right after his fifty. batsman lbw b bowler 50(39) [4s-5 6s-1]"
6464,"out Caught by Uthappa!! Stunned silence among the Orange army supporters. Pathan departs early as he fails to clear the long-on fence. Floated up and wooed Pathan into a biggie, who fell for the trap. Lofted it high, only height and it sailed into the black sky to long-on. Uthappa sets under it and swallows it. Excellent comeback this from team after being under the pump. batsman c Uthappa b bowler 2(4)"
6465,"SIX, cow corner is Pandey's favourite spot and he dismisses one for a maximum. Krishna misses his yorker, Pandey cleared his front leg and banged it flat, enough timing on it to take it all the way"
6466,"out Caught by Karthik!! team are chipping away with wickets as batsman perishes. Russell gets the better of his countryman. Skiddy short ball that tucks batsman for space and hurries onto him, went for the pull and failed to get any timing on it. Splices it up in the air and DK prances forward to grab it. team losing gas at the death. batsman c Karthik b bowler 3(4)"
6467,"FOUR, Russell persists with short to batsman, but it was the slower short ball and batsman read it early. Stayed back and pulled it over square leg"
6468,"out Caught by (sub)Rinku Singh!! Has that been taken? Oh, it has. It has. The default Sub fielder for team - Rinku Singh takes a stunning catch. Another one falls and team are losing the plot here. Second wicket for Krishna, who's been brilliant in his fresh spell. The slower ball, that dips and Pandey takes it on the full to mow it towards deep mid-wicket. Doesn't get it off the middle and the ball was dying in front of Rinku - who dives forward and gobbles it up. batsman c (sub)Rinku Singh b bowler 25(22) [4s-2 6s-1]"
6469,"FOUR, misses the yorker on this occasion and batsman makes him pay. Fuller length delivery outside off, batsman plants his front foot across and hammers the drive through extra cover. Rocketed away to the fence"
6470,"out Caught by Narine!! And batsman combusts. Krishna has been pretty impressive today. The slower short ball, angling at batsman, who in a bid to pull - gets it high on the bat. Skes it to square leg and Narine ain't dropping those. batsman c Narine b bowler 10(7) [4s-2]"
6471,"out Caught by Karthik!! Raining wickets for Kolkata. Two in two for Krishna and he becomes the second player from Karnataka to take four wickets so far today, informs my colleague Varun Dixit. Banged in short just outside off, Rashid slogs across the line and gets a thick top-edge that goes high in the air. Skipper takes the matter in his own hands and backtracks, keeps his eyes on the ball and nestles it safely in his glove. batsman c Karthik b bowler 0(1)"
6472,"no run, batsman has been given out caught at slip, he wants a review. It's a fair ball, it's gone off the helmet, but is there some glove before it? I don't think so, there's daylight between gloves and the ball, should get this decision overturned, batsman. Ultraedge confirms it as well. NOT OUT is the call. That's a good review from batsman, he knew there wasn't any bat or glove, the bouncer from Russell and batsman was way too late on the pull, thudded into his helmet and lobbed towards Rana at slip. Umpire Anil Chaudhary was quick to raise his finger, but he has to change his call"
6473,"SIX, that's adding insult to injury for Russell, on a good length and just outside off, batsman backs away slightly, plays with an open face and slices it high and over cover, went a long way over the stands"
6474,"FOUR, cracking shot, batsman is chancing his good luck now, this was full and this was wide of off, batsman makes room and cracks it square past cover, beats the fielder in the ring and scorches away to the ropes"
6475,"byes, FOUR, that took off from a length, this is turning out to be a big over for team. This was a back of a length delivery just outside off, surprised batsman as it took off from a length, he stabbed and was done in by the bounce, it kept rising and even a leaping keeper can't stop it, four byes added to the total"
6476,"out batsman Run Out!! Wow. Wow. This is exceptional finish from Krishna and team. 4 wickets and just 4 runs in the over. Take a bow, Krishna. Ushered it short and gets it to rise over Kumar's attempted hoick. Fails to connect and they try to sneak in a bye. But DK hits the bulls-eye and catches the batsman well short of his crease. batsman run out (Karthik) 0(1)"
6477,"FOUR, finesse from batsman, back of a length and just outside off, batsman waits on it, plays with an open face and steers it in the gap behind square on the off-side, 20 from the over"
6478,"FOUR, woeful from the fielder at cover, I think it's Uthappa. This was tossed up wide of off, batsman reached out and crashed it towards cover. The ball bounced awkwardly in front of him and batsman didn't get his body behind it either"
6479,"FOUR, that's all too easy for batsman, wrong line from bowler, drifted this one down the leg-side, the fielder at fine leg was inside the ring and all batsman had to do was to find the gap past him, he does so with the sweep and raises team's 50"
6480,"SIX, lovely, tad too full from bowler, batsman gets a good stride forward, drives it through the line and clears the ropes at long-on with ease. The key was he didn't look to muscle the shot, nor did he play across the line"
6481,"FOUR, beautifully played, this was tossed up well outside leg, batsman went down low, reversed his stance, got on top of the bounce and then found the gap behind square on the off-side"
6482,"FOUR, poor ball from Kuldeep, dropped it short and at the stumps, batsman had plenty of time as he rocked back and pulled it wide of mid-wicket, even the big dive from Russell can't prevent the ball from hitting the ropes"
6483,"1 run, had bowler hit the target, Goswami might have been struggling. batsman set off for a quick single after nudging the ball towards short mid-wicket. bowler was quick on his follow-through, ran across Goswami, got to the ball and then fired a throw at the striker's end, he missed with Goswami way short of his crease"
6484,"out Caught by A Russell!! Catching practice for Russell at long-on and team have lost their first wicket. This was tossed up nicely by Kuldeep, batsman came down the track, didn't get close to the ball as he went through with the lofted drive, went off the inside half of the bat and looped towards long-on. batsman has played his part though, walks off to a decent round of applause. batsman c A Russell b bowler 35(26) [4s-4 6s-1]"
6485,"FOUR, cracking shot, that's quite a way to get going, dropped short and at the stumps, batsman gets halfway down and pummels it past square leg. Kuldeep is disappointed, knew immediately that it was a bad first ball to the new batsman"
6486,"FOUR, fired in from round the wicket once again, angling towards leg-stump, Maxi plants his front leg across and slugs a pseudo-pull off a low stance towards fine leg for four. Used the pace and angle, didn't need much power"
6487,"FOUR, slips through slip's hands! A fraction short, very little width, Shaw's teenage upper body tries a cut, gets a top-edge that flies over Suryakumar Yadav at slip, as he gets a fingertip to it. Away to third man for four"
6488,"SIX, massive, that should break the shackles for DD, too full and in the slot, batsman extends his arms and lifts it high and over long-on, Rohit was a mere spectator as the ball sailed over his head"
6489,"SIX, a one-handed six now, how do you bowl to this man? On a good length and well outside off, batsman was looking to swipe it towards the on-side, his bottom hand came off at the point of impact, but it still had enough power to sail into the crowd at wide long-on"
6490,"1 run, bowler keeps it full and just outside off, driven back at the bowler who gets a hand onto it and deflects it away towards long-on, that single raises another fifty for batsman - who also has the orange cap back with him"
6491,"FOUR, edged and four, batsman was clueless when he last batted against bowler, but he gets away with a boundary first ball this time. Nothing convincing about the shot though, this was the off-cutter that gripped the surface and was pushed across the right-hander, batsman went hard on the cut, got a fat top-edge that flew in the gap between the keeper and short third man"
6492,"SIX, cheeky and six, how good is this shot? Length delivery on the stumps, batsman was quick to reverse his stance, plays with an open face and ramps it over short third man, Hardik's pace is enough for the ball to sail over the ropes"
6493,"no run, batsman has been given out LBW and he immediately reviews. I think it's pitching well outside leg, a shocker from umpire Nandan and feel this will be overturned. No bat on that and it's confirmed by Ultraedge. Hawk-Eye will confirm my doubt and it has pitched miles outside leg. NOT OUT is the call. Poor decision from umpire Nandan and the crowd cheer as NOT OUT flashes on the screen. batsman was looking to whip a full ball on his pads and missed"
6494,"leg byes, FOUR, poor line and length from Hardik, length ball on batsman's pads, he was looking to flick and missed, struck his pads and ran away fine, beat the keeper and rolled away to the fence"
6495,"SIX, another one-handed six, Hardik is getting a serious pasting here. Another length ball on batsman's pads, he was looking to swipe it over square leg, the bottom-hand came off at the point of impact, still it flew high and deep into the stands"
6496,"out Caught by Pollard!! This was coming, not many runs in the over and batsman was getting increasingly agitated, deserving reward for the elder Pandya. This was tossed up on the stumps, perhaps a bit slow off the surface as well, batsman slogged hard and flat, no real elevation behind the shot, straight into the bucket hands of Pollard at long-on. batsman gets a pat on his back by his former U-19 captain, Kishan, as he walks back. batsman c Pollard b bowler 64(44) [4s-4 6s-4]"
6497,"SIX, lovely, length ball from bowler and it sat up to be smacked, Abhishek waits on it and then pummels it sweetly - high and way over mid-wicket for a massive six"
6498,"1 run, chance and dropped, Rohit is wriggling in pain, but he gets up and it seems to be all OK. Coming to the ball, it was a high full-toss that was sliced to the left of backward point. Rohit tumbled across and think the ball hit him high on the arm"
6499,"FOUR, another poor ball from bowler, full-toss on batsman's hips and all he had to do was to clip, he does so and beats the tumbling dive from Rahul Chahar - running across from fine leg"
6500,"SIX, beautifully played, length delivery on the stumps, batsman leans forward, presents the full face of the bat, high elbow and the ball sails over the sightscreen for a maximum"
6501,"FOUR, back of a length delivery angling towards off and middle, batsman shuffles across to get off-side of the ball and tickles it away to fine leg for four. Uses the pace extremely well, does batsman. Not something he's known for, but there he is proving everyone wrong and playing the finesse game"
6502,"FOUR, good length delivery in the channel outside off, batsman lets it come on, true bounce and no lateral movement, driven away on the up to deep extra cover for four"
6503,"FOUR, short delivery outside off, Prithvi shows poor technique and shot selection, trying to drag it towards the on-side with a pull, gets a thick under-edge away to fine leg where Bumrah puts in the dive but in vain as it goes through for four. Good effort, but not good enough"
6504,"out Prithvi Shaw Run Out!! Looks like it's a run-out! Just an off-cutter, sliced away off the front-foot towards backward point where Pandya picks up and throws at the non-striker's end. Shaw sees the ball coming, and is still walking towards the crease, assuming that the ball will miss the stumps! Absolutely abominable from Shaw. He wants the ground to swallow him up, does Shaw. Prithvi Shaw run out (Hardik Pandya) 12(8) [4s-2]"
6505,"FOUR, slower one, off-cutter on a good length, not much deviation, and batsman bottom-hand-lofts it through the line to long-off for a one-drop four"
6506,"out Bowled!! That's quick stuff @144km/h. bowler is no sulker! No LBW? No problem. Leave nothing to the umpire. Length delivery, seaming in just enough, batsman tries to loft through the line, gets an inside edge onto his pad and it finally ricochets onto his stumps. Huge breakthrough for the Mumbaikars, as their stump-vanquisher uproots the sticks of the Big Show one last time. batsman b bowler 22(18) [4s-4]"
6507,"FOUR, shortish delivery, not much width, batsman punches it to sweeper cover off the back foot and freeze-frames his stance for a future batting manual"
6508,"FOUR, leg-break, but down the wrong line, and a tad short, batsman gets back and helps it on its way with a pull to backward square leg for four. Easy picking for a man in form."
6509,"SIX, full delivery angling towards leg, the googly, but batsman comes down the track and gets to the pitch so fast that he doesn't let it turn. Gets that bat of his down from a high backlift and slogs it into the deep mid-wicket crowd for six"
6510,"FOUR, crash, bang, wallop! Short, fractionally wide, batsman lashes out at it and finds the gap between short third and backward point for four. Hardest cutter since Sehwag, may I say?"
6511,"1 run, slower shot one, batsman is early into the pull and gets a thick under edge towards square leg for a single. A throw at the striker's end, and a direct-hit. The umpire goes up to his ally upstairs, but all is well."
6512,"FOUR, drag-down of a leg-break, batsman gets on the back foot, clears the front leg, and whip-pulls that to deep square leg for four"
6513,"out Caught by Krunal Pandya!! The wrong 'un on off, a tad short, batsman gets deep in the crease and has enough time to check out the leg-side field and then go for the shot. Pulls it straight down the throat of Krunal at deep mid-wicket who takes it comfortably. Is the foot on the rope? Nope, apparently not. Captain Capital's got to go. batsman c Krunal Pandya b bowler 6(10)"
6514,"FOUR, shortish and skiddy outside off, batsman gets low and slices that away to deep backward point for four. Perfect placement behind backward point"
6515,"FOUR, poor start from the young leggie. Real loosener - a rank long hop, offering a freebie for Suryakumar first up. The batsman rocks back and murders it over mid-wicket"
6516,"SIX, the intentions are clear from Suryakumar. Wasting no time whatsoever in putting these filths to the fence. Another dragged down delivery, on leg. Suryakumar bends low to get in line with the ball and hacks it behind square for a maximum. 10 off first two, pressure on the bowler"
6517,"out Caught by Vijay Shankar!! The adrenaline rush from Suryakumar, was never going to clear long-on. The googly from bowler, skidded off the surface and Suryakumar was on the back foot. In a bid to unleash his bottom-handed whip, mistimes, gets a leading edge and picks out Vijay Shankar, who sprinted forward and tumbles. Importantly holds onto it. Sandeep roars, for he gets his revenge. batsman c Vijay Shankar b bowler 12(4) [4s-1 6s-1]"
6518,"SIX, but that is not the way Hardik thinks.. Anything with flight and in his arc, Hardik will go for it, through the line and with a clean bat swing sends it soaring over the long-on fence, into the second tier"
6519,"FOUR, hammered! Pressure on the teenager. bowler tries to fire it full and outside off, Pandya did well to get under that and drill the drive through extra cover. No chance for Boult from long-off to cut it off"
6520,"1 run, that left shoulder will certainly be tested with the dive. Pushed it through and got the ball to grip, Pandya squirts it off the outer half to the left of Iyer at cover, Rohit called for the single and had to put in the dive to make his ground. Direct hit might have made things more interesting"
6521,"FOUR, there's the boundary for the over Mumbai need. Low full toss outside off, batsman crouches a bit and uses the pace of bowler, opens the bat face and steers it between backward point and short third man"
6522,"FOUR, 17 off the over and that releases the pressure that Mishra and Lamichhane built up. Full and on the pads, easy pickings for Pandya, who flicks it nonchalantly past the diving short fine leg fielder. It was just the matter of putting it in the gap and Pandya did it to perfection"
6523,"out Caught by Boult!! It is the Maxwell-Boult partnership again. Seemed like a replay of the Pollard dismissal. The duo even have a laugh together. This was much more easily done by Maxwell. The third umpire has a check and there's nothing to overturn the soft signal. Another failure for batsman. He's had a terrible season. More importantly leaves his team in a spot of bother. The slower off-cutter grips the surface and deceives batsman compeletly, he was into the shot early and went through with it, the bottom hand comes off and the ball skies towards long-on, Maxwell runs across and takes the catch, but with the momentum taking him out, he lobs the ball to Boult, who came running from long-off. batsman c Boult b bowler 13(11) [4s-1]"
6524,"out Caught by (sub)Rahul Tewatia!! Is that the game? Ishan Kishan thinks so as he has his hands on his head. One of the team cheerleaders did not like Pandya's shot selection either. Needless from Pandya. Last over for bowler and he should have tried to play him out, but that is not the sort of batsman he is. Saw the floaty delivery outside off and went for the big loft downtown, sliced it off the outer half to backward point, where Tewatia picks up his second catch. batsman c (sub)Rahul Tewatia b bowler 27(17) [4s-2 6s-1]"
6525,"SIX, that's more like it. Right in the slot and it is a 83 meter six from batsman. Just a bit of shuffle to off and got nicely underneath the length ball, the big forearms then took over to smash it over long-on"
6526,"1 run, direct hit and Markande was a goner. Low full toss and batsman shuffled across and tried to help it round the corner, found the fielder at short fine and pushed Markande for the single, he wanted to retain the strike. Markande was not even in the frame as Lamichhane missed the sticks"
6527,"FOUR, good way to start the over. Shade too straight from bowler, on off and middle, batsman gets inside the line and whips it backward of square leg. He ensured that he got it past the man at short fine leg"
6528,"SIX, wow! That's gone a long way. This match ain't over. Mumbai's season ain't over. Until batsman is there. bowler is bowling length and batsman is waiting for it, muscles the loft well over the long-on fence"
6529,"FOUR, 14 runs off the first three balls. Pressure. Pressure! Once again bowler goes full with a pacy delivery, batsman says thank you very much and smashes the leather off the ball, right over Markande and giving long-on no chance. Even Rohit could afford a clap with that boundary"
6530,"1 run, direct hit and that was over. Cutting went for the single and he was not even in the frame. Full delivery and batsman digs the drive out to cover, the pair had to go and Shaw was the fielder. Took his time and fired a throw at the striker's end. Missed and Mumbai stay alive. Pant also came charging forward and slipped while collecting the ball. Had he stayed on his feet and collected it cleanly, Cutting was still gone"
6531,"out Bowled!! Bowled 'im. Top over under pressure from the Kiwi. Mumbai could get only 5 runs off it. Round the wicket and though he misses the yorker length, his pace makes up for it, batsman does not lay bat on the pacy full toss and has his off-stump uprooted. batsman b bowler 3(10)"
6532,"SIX, oh my! batsman has got the best possible start to the over. Patel does not have the pace to bowl short and it sits up nicely for batsman, who swivels across and sends the pull soaring over the long leg fence"
6533,"out Caught by Maxwell!! Patel pumps his fist. batsman hangs his head down and trudges off. The Mumbai supporters are in shock. That must be the match? The slower delivery and it was right in the arc, but the slow nature made batsman generate all the power and he could only heave it as far as deep mid-wicket. Maxwell keeps his cool and takes it calmly. Settled nicely under it. batsman c Maxwell b bowler 37(20) [4s-2 6s-3]"
6534,"out Caught by Boult!! Mumbai have been knocked out. Cutting and Rohit take a moment to soak in what has transpired. The Mumbai skipper then gathers himself and shakes hands with his team mates. It is only the fourth time that Mumbai have not made the playoffs. Some happy faces in the Delhi camp as they finish with back to back wins. Another slower delivery and batsman had to go for it, miscued it towards long-on and Boult ran in to complete the catch. batsman c Boult b bowler 0(1)"
6535,"FOUR, batsman was waiting for this. Half-volley begging to be smashed and batsman accepts it with glee. Planting his front foot across and belts it through cover"
6536,"1 run, in the airr and Vijay Shankar shells it down. It was a tough chance as batsman had hammered it hard. And guess what? batsman could've still been dismissed had Iyer - who was backing up, effected a direct-hit at the non-striker's end. batsman had given up"
6537,"FOUR, ungainly loft but batsman manages to clear the in-field on the off-side. Cutter outside off, batsman threw it all, lost his shape but the power of his willow takes it all the way to the fence. Iyer with a desperate chase, but in vain"
6538,"SIX, batsman is wading into Patel now. Overbakes and bangs it short, batsman can deal with short balls with ease. Sits back and muscles it way back into the deep mid-wicket stands. Into the second tier"
6539,"SIX, in the slot and batsman makes bowler pay the penalty. Flighted full outside off, batsman chips out of his crease, flexes his muscles and smokes it over long-off. Stand and dismiss stuff"
6540,"FOUR, two dots and batsman breaks free. Flat and short down leg, batsman swivels across and helps it behind square for a boundary"
6541,"SIX, a six off the final ball and 16 runs to cap off the over. batsman is getting a move on here. Motions out of his crease to meet the pitch and allows his bottom hand to take over. Blasted disdainfully over long-off"
6542,"out Caught by Vijay Shankar!! First ball wicket after the break. bowler strikes gold. But wouldn't have been possible without Vijay Shankar - who has pulled off a blinder at long-on. Compensates for his earlier blip where he dropped Lewis at cover. Flighted teasingly from bowler, Kishan took the bait -- had to because he was struggling a bit. Meets the pitch in a hurry and smashed it flat towards long-on. Vijay Shankar at the edge of the ropes, judges it well and clings onto it above his head. Made sure, he didn't topple over the ropes despite one leg balancing in the air. batsman c Vijay Shankar b bowler 5(13)"
6543,"3 runs, edged and put down by Shaw. bowler is not happy with the effort. Slips in the leggie and lured batsman once again, who outside-edged it to first slip. Shaw leapt, it was sailing over his head. Gets a finger-tip to it and it runs away towards third man. What a miss for Delhi!"
6544,"SIX, batsman gets underneath this flighted delivery and sweeps it straight into the ad-cushions behind square on the leg-side. bowler looped it on leg-stump and batsman went low in time to connect it beautifully to smash it for a maximum"
6545,"out Stumped!! bowler has the last laugh and pumps his fists. Just when batsman was looking more threatening, DD have sent him packing back to the hut. The wrong 'un from bowler that foxes batsman, stepped forward and aimed to for a cross-batted slog over long-on. The ball dips and turns in to slider under his bat. Pant was waiting behind and breaks the stumps in time. batsman st Pant b bowler 48(31) [4s-3 6s-4]"
6546,"out Caught by Boult!! Wowza! Maxi-Boult combo pulls off a replica of Mayank-Tiwary's catch. But hang on, they have referred it to the third umpire. No issues with the front foot and no issues with the catch too, looks pretty clean and batsman can continue his long walk back to the pavilion. Two in two for Delhi and what a comeback. Jitters in the Mumbai camp as they lose their fourth. Tossed up on the stumps, batsman lifts it with a straight bat. Doesn't get enough power to clear long-on. Maxi stays at the edge of the ropes, grabs it and realises that he is going over the ropes. Throws the ball to Boult - who was waiting to gobble it up. Talk about tag-team effort. Outstanding. batsman c Boult b bowler 7(7)"
6547,"FOUR, Krunal is off the mark with a boundary. Floated on leg, Krunal sinks low and sweeps, gets it much finer and collects a boundary"
6548,"out Caught by (sub)Rahul Tewatia!! In the air and taken. Mumbai crumbling as they lose half their side. Phew! Look out for bowler, he's off for a celebratory run. Googly again, in the driving spot. Krunal went for it and spooned it uppishly to cover. The sub fielder Tewatia, does a fine job. Sprawls across and pouches it safely. batsman c (sub)Rahul Tewatia b bowler 4(3) [4s-1]"
6549,"out Caught by Rahul!! Edged and taken! Mohit gets the man in form. Swing does the trick once again. Short of a length around off, with a bit of away swing written on it. batsman tries to fend it down but gets an outside edge and Rahul doesn't make any mistake. Can Mohit get one more? batsman c Rahul b bowler 1(3)"
6550,"out Lbw!! bowler strikes first ball! This was plumb. A carrom ball which pitches in line with middle and straightens. batsman kneeled down to slog-sweep but in vain, to be hit on the back leg. Only one way that was headed. batsman lbw b bowler 19(22) [4s-2 6s-1]"
6551,"SIX, he has whacked this carrom ball over deep square leg's head. Not long boundaries here, so even a decent contact comfortably takes it over the ropes. Walked across the stumps, sat down low and got a great length for the slog-sweep"
6552,"SIX, now a blistering strike over long-off. Wow. bowler had fired this pretty wide of off, so batsman had to reach out slightly, but the timing is still so sublime"
6553,"FOUR, short and wide, batsman stretches out to reach it and then cuts it away to the point boundary. He's taking bowler apart"
6554,"SIX, my word does he have some ability with the bat! This is a stunning shot. Makes some room to a length ball and flat-bats it over long-off. Wow Deepak batsman"
6555,"out Caught by Mohit Sharma!! Sliced up off a thick edge, Mohit Sharma gets underneath it comfortably at cover. So batsman's joyride comes to an end. The carrom ball was cleverly fired out of his arc, and his leg-side swipe was always vulnerable to the ball turning away. He's done his job though. He's done more than what could've been asked of him. batsman c Mohit Sharma b bowler 39(20) [4s-1 6s-3]"
6556,"FOUR, batsman absolutely nails this! Spoils what was turning out to be a good over. Brings up 4000 IPL runs for himself as well. Back of length at the stumps, he opens himself up and swings into a brutal cross-batted smite through square leg"
6557,"SIX, finally gets hold of one! He waited just a moment longer to account for the knuckle ball, and then heaved it away for a flat six. Even this had come more off the bottom of his bat actually, but again, these are short boundaries"
6558,"SIX, pops Tye over long-on to raise his fifty! The equation has come down to a run-a-ball. Don't think he got this one off the middle either, but got enough to just clear the leaping fielder"
6559,"FOUR, sliced away in front of deep point, where the fielder dashes in only to find that he's badly misjudged it. Then he doesn't put his body behind it either, allowing it to slip past the side of him"
6560,"FOUR, short ball at the head, batsman swivels across nicely and helps the pull away to the fine leg boundary. Just one more needed. What a late assault"
6561,"SIX, finishes it off by pulling this short ball over the long leg boundary, and then calmly tips the bails over. And that's how the IPL 2018 league stages end, with team, team, team and team going through"
6562,"FOUR, in the air... but safe! Length ball around off, batsman checks his drive and manages to elude the bowler. Any other day and this would have been a catch"
6563,"FOUR, batsman is riding his luck! This was a length delivery snaking away, he tried to punch it on the up and got a thick outside edge. Past the man at second slip and into the third man fence. As a result of this, Ashwin has decided to bring in the third slip too"
6564,"FOUR, first convincing shot of the day by batsman. Thinks he's had enough of bowler! Dances down the wicket and chips the back of a length ball over cover. That'll make him feel much better"
6565,"FOUR, width on offer and batsman pounces on it. Was short and wide outside off, batsman reached for it and carved it over point. Third man is too fine to cut this down"
6566,"FOUR, what a fine shot! This is what he's known for. Charges down the wicket and drills this one past the bowler. Tye had no chance to stop it, nor did any of the fielders out there"
6567,"out Caught by Gayle!! That's gone! Have to give full marks to Gayle for this effort. Both openers are back in the pavilion without doing much. Was short of a length and outside off, batsman went hard at it and got an outside edge. Gayle at first slip was quick to get down and reverse cup it just before the ball was about to hit ground. Had his fingers beneath and the replays confirm it. batsman c Gayle b bowler 14(15) [4s-3]"
6568,"out Bowled!! Jaffa. Peach. Ripper. Call it whatever. This was unplayable, indeed. Pitched on off and snakes away a tad to beat batsman defence. Hits the top of off and batsman is a dead duck. bowler is on a hat-trick and he can might well get it. It's Harbhajan Singh who walks out to bat ahead of Dhoni, Bravo and Jadeja. batsman b bowler 0(1)"
6569,"no run, dropped! bowler almost gets another one. Finch the culprit on this occasion. Squared him up completely with the length delivery and induced an outside edge too. However, Finch at second slip makes a mess of it! This was a straight-forward catch for Gayle. Double wicket-maiden for bowler. Absolute gold!"
6570,"1 run, tucks the length delivery to square leg and calls for a risky single. Had this been a direct hit at the striker's end, Bhajji was gone. Miller was the fielder and he could have taken some more time before having a go"
6571,"FOUR, this is what he's here for! Short of a length around off, batsman clears his front leg and slashes this over backward point. One bounce and into the hoardings"
6572,"SIX, finally gets some bat on it! Was trying to do this since ages. Clears his front leg and pumps the length delivery over long-off for a flat six"
6573,"FOUR, wants to drag the sweep shot from well wide of off, but only manages an under-edge. Cruelly for bowler though, it's gone between the keeper's legs for four"
6574,"FOUR, magnificent stroke! Not a bad ball by any means. A good length outswinger, batsman leans forward and creams the drive through extra cover. No need to run for shots like that"
6575,"out Caught by Dhoni!! What was that? A half-hearted appeal for caught-behind, the umpire doesn't raise his finger, but batsman walks. Well, team have the breakthrough. And, it's a big wicket. A harmless ball sliding down leg from a back of a length, batsman gets a glove on it, trying to tuck. The Jamaican stood for a while and decided to go off. batsman c Dhoni b bowler 0(2)"
6576,"out Caught by Dhoni!! Have team forgotten to appeal? Didn't appeal for Gayle, he walked. This time a timid appeal for the sake of it from RJ and the umpire raises his finger. A wicket off his first ball for Ravindra bowler. Gave a bit of flight on this ball from round the wicket did RJ and the ball doesn't spin much after pitching outside off. Tiwary is down on his knee to swipe and gets a faint edge to the keeper. Off the toe end. That threatened to bobble out of the keeper's hand, but MS doesn't make any mistake. batsman c Dhoni b bowler 35(30) [4s-3 6s-1]"
6577,"out Bowled!! The zing bails light up and then there's the jig from Bravo. Perfect yorker from the West Indian, batsman slightly moved leg-side to create room. He is too late to bring his bat down and the ball crashes into the middle stump. team in deep trouble here - 80/5! batsman b bowler 24(22) [4s-1 6s-1]"
6578,"SIX, just clears the man in the deep. Flatter around middle and leg, batsman goes down on his knee and slog sweeps it over square leg. Ngidi is the man in the deep who tries hard to grab it in left hand but it's way above him"
6579,"SIX, excellent lofted shot. Full in length around off, batsman moves away, makes room for himself and times his loft over long-off. Right from the meat and comfortably over the ropes"
6580,"SIX, lovely shot! Picks the length early on the short one, backs away and nonchalantly lofts it over long-off. Has enough on it to evade the man in the deep"
6581,"out Caught by Billings!! Terrific catch by Billings! Short delivery around off, batsman goes for the pull and miscues it to deep mid-wicket. Billings comes running in and just as the ball is about to die in front of him, he puts in a dive and pulls off a ripper. The wicket belongs to the fielder, more than the bowler. batsman c Billings b bowler 14(12) [6s-1]"
6582,"FOUR, batsman continues to march on. The wicket won't make a difference to him. A full length delivery around off, batsman moves away and chips it over covers. Billings can't get there in time"
6583,"SIX, shot! This is what team exactly want. Short again on middle and leg, batsman stays in his crease and swings it over square leg. Way into the stands, such sweet was the timing"
6584,"FOUR, 18 runs off the over! Just what the doctor ordered for Punjab. This was full and outside off, batsman threw his bat at it and got an outside edge that eluded Dhoni and found the fence"
6585,"out Caught by Dhoni!! Full marks to the bowler there. He was sure that the batsman had nicked it and batsman has to walk back for a golden duck. Short delivery outside off, batsman tries to run it down to third man but gets a slight feather on its way to the keeper. Even he wasn't sure that if had nicked it. UltraEdge confirms with a spike! batsman c Dhoni b bowler 0(1)"
6586,"out Caught by Raina!! Another one for Ngidi. He's taking down Punjab single handedly tonight. Got Rahul and Gayle earlier, gets Ashwin and Tye now. This was short of a length around off, Tye tried to punch it off his back foot but his bottom hand came off and he ended up miscuing it to mid-off. Can't get any easier for Raina! batsman c Raina b bowler 0(2)"
6587,"FOUR, that's a fantastic shot by batsman. Full length delivery on leg, batsman improvises at the last moment and reverse whips it over backward point. Just eludes the man stationed in that position"
6588,"SIX, he's getting better as this innings is progressing. Gets down on his knee and picks the length delivery over fine leg. Good enough to reach the distance"
6589,"SIX, fifty for Karun batsman! Preity Zinta in the stands loves it. Was a short delivery around off, batsman comes down the wicket and slaps the slower one over long-on"
6590,"out Caught by Chahar!! He's disappointed, disappointed at throwing his wicket away. He has done his job though. Tries to chip the low full toss over mid-off but gets it off the toe end and Chahar at mid-off completes the formalities. Should have waited for the last over, would have made some difference to the end score. batsman c Chahar b bowler 54(26) [4s-3 6s-5]"
6591,"out Caught by du Plessis!! du Plessis takes a clean catch at long-on and that's the end of Punjab. Reckon, this total is not good enough to take them through to the playoffs. Was a short delivery that was swatted away to long-on by batsman. du Plessis was the man near the fence who took it and managed to stay inside the boundary. batsman c du Plessis b bowler 2(4)"
6592,"FOUR, seam-up delivery swinging away, batsman rocks back and punches it beautifully through covers, beating a diving Faf. First boundary for batsman"
6593,"out Caught by Raina!! Superb catch from Raina at first slip. Moved swiftly to his left and catches it above his head. A nothing shot from batsman. He knew that the ball is swinging, still flirts with a ball outside off sans any feet movement. Short of good length and nipping away from the right-hander, batsman gets squared up and can only manage an outside edge that finds the safe palms of Raina. batsman c Raina b bowler 4(6) [4s-1]"
6594,"out Bowled!! Wow! This is excellent bowling from bowler. After all those away-going deliveries, he gets one to shape in. batsman shoulders arms and loses his off-stump. Top-class bowling. A goodish length from over the wicket and batsman anticipating the ball swing away raised his bat. It was however,, the inswinger. Hits the top of off. team's best batsman this season departs for a cheap score. batsman b bowler 7(11) [4s-1]"
6595,"FOUR, good shot to get going. He is out of his crease to negate swing. bowler's inswinger ends up on his pads and batsman doesn't miss out. Leans across and flicks it beautifully through backward square leg"
6596,"SIX, for a moment, I thought that he had mishit that. How wrong was I? Pitched up delivery outside off, batsman reaches out, bends the back knee and lofts it over long-off. High and handsome. A six off the free-hit"
6597,"FOUR, horror ball to begin. Short, wide asking to be punished. Tiwary stays leg-side of the ball as he goes deep in his crease. Then employs the cut shot behind square on the off-side"
6598,"SIX, Jadeja can only get a hand on it and he parries it over the ropes. Would be very harsh to call it a drop. Tiwary danced down the track and slug in the direction of the turn. Just over RJ at long-on, who timed his jump to perfection and went for a one-handed catch"
6599,"FOUR, not sure if he intened to go there. Fuller length ball swinging in on leg, Tiwary's bat turns at the point of impact as he looks to on-drive. The ball races away to deep square leg off the inside half of the bat"
6600,"1 run, slower ball, full on leg, wristed to mid-wicket and the charging in fielder - Thakur slides and loses his balance. Luckily, no damage"
6601,"FOUR, edged and four. Tiwary didn't see a short ball coming ball. Got big on the batsman and Tiwary persisted with the pull shot. The top edge flies over Dhoni's head for a boundary"
6602,"out Caught by Goswami!! Edged and caught! The perfect start from bowler, an absolute peach and he has gobbled batsman up. Fraction short in length and a hint of shape away from outside off, made batsman feel for the ball, found the tiniest of bat and Goswami does the rest. Defending 140, they needed early wickets and bowler has just got them one. batsman c Goswami b bowler 0(5)"
6603,"FOUR, too short and too wide from Sandeep, that's a loosener and that's been put away with ease. Had to reach out - batsman, but he got on top of the bounce and found the gap past cover-point"
6604,"FOUR, lovely shot, too full and too wide from Sandeep, he hasn't found the right line and length so far. batsman leans into the drive, didn't get close to the ball, as a result it was in the air for a long time, but he found the gap to the left of cover and it scooted away"
6605,"FOUR, cracking shot, this is the best of the lot, full and just outside off, batsman leans forward, presents the full face of the bat and drives it back past the non-striker, no need to run for those"
6606,"out Caught by Dhawan!! Pouched at slip by Dhawan. bowler jogs away with his arms spread. Oh he loves bowling at the Wankhede. The extra fizz off the surface works wonders for him. Pushed through on a good length outside off, Bravo wafts at it and perishes to the turn and bite. team on a roll. batsman c Dhawan b bowler 7(11)"
6607,"out Caught&Bowled!! Not anymore he's not. Dear me. He's chipped this knuckle ball straight back to Sandeep, completely bamboozled. Beautifully disguised on a good length around middle, batsman tries working it through the on-side but he's way too early into the shot. team are turning a defence of 140 into a one-sided affair. Quite unbelievable turn of events here. batsman c and b bowler 3(5)"
6608,"FOUR, backs away against this arm-ball and hacks it through mid-wicket. He's got it between long-on and deep mid-wicket, and despite a committed dive from Manish Pandey, he can only parry the ball into the ropes"
6609,"SIX, straight down the ground from Faf, clean strike. He's got to pick his bowlers now, and he's got 10 off two balls from bowler. Swings through the line of the full ball and sends it soaring over long-on"
6610,"SIX, and batsman goes bang. Well, not quite a BANG, but bang enough. Off-pace back of length delivery, he swipes cross-batted and clears the mid-wicket boundary. It came off the toe-end, but these are short boundary"
6611,"FOUR, carved away over extra-cover, and all of a sudden team have the momentum. Full ball outside off, Faf somehow manages to get under it and lifts it over Williamson in the infield"
6612,"out Caught by Brathwaite!! Has Brathwaite taken this? It will be a sensational catch if he has. Tom Moody gets on his feet in the dugout. Big moment. The soft signal is out. And it doesn't take long for the third umpire to uphold the onfield call. Dhoni looks a bit miffed as he crosses his arms. Full ball, not an easy length to get under, which is why batsman's loft hardly finds much elevation. It's a flat hit in front of long-on, with the ball dipping on Brathwaite and making him the second favourite. But he charges in while covering great ground and dives forward to get his fingers underneath. What a game he's had. batsman c Brathwaite b bowler 10(6) [6s-1]"
6613,"no run, and this call, if upheld, could seal the game. Faf given out LBW to a googly from Rashid. He's gone for the review. This is shady, as the ball seems to be a bit leg-sidish. You can see middle and off stump when it hit the pad. Williamson has already got his fielders in position, so he doesn't seem very confident. Yes, as expected, it's missing leg stump. Faf survives. team still alive, if only just"
6614,"FOUR, he's successfully targetted extra cover again. Full ball outside off, pretty short of the blockhole, so Faf has enough space to get it over Williamson's head"
6615,"SIX, oh what a shot. He's picked the bones out of it. An 87-metre six pumps up the team dugout while raising the fifty for the South African player. bowler offers it in the slot again, and gets smoked away"
6616,"FOUR, four more. Just the over team need. Leg-cutter on a back of length, and although he's deceived by it, he's able to drag it away past short fine leg"
6617,"out Harbhajan Run Out!! 1 run completed. This is stunning bit of work in the outfield from Rashid Khan. Faf had absolutely drilled this drive to his right at deep extra cover. But not only does he race across and slide to stop it, he also fires in a rocket throw back to bowler to catch Harbhajan well short. Harbhajan run out (Rashid Khan/bowler) 2(9)"
6618,"FOUR, he's got the boundary. Full ball outside off, the field is set in a way that there are three fielders to the left of point in a ring, and sweeper cover is pretty straight. So Faf carves this full ball square enough of Rashid in the deep to beat him. What a knock he's playing"
6619,"FOUR, forget turning the strike over, Thakur has squirted this for four. It's running team's way. Kaul's so terribly unlucky though. Beaut of a yorker on off, Thakur gets it right off the toe-end, and with third man up, it runs away"
6620,"FOUR, would you believe it? Another french cut for four. Kaul doesn't know how to react. Back of length, cramps Thakur up and takes the inside edge to the fine leg boundary"
6621,"FOUR, Shardul Thakur, are you kidding me! He's making up for all the punishment he took from the hands of Carlos Brathwaite. Wankhede erupts. Full ball at the stumps, drilled back past the bowler's head. Swirls away into the fence"
6622,"SIX, Faf batsman, you champion! He takes just one ball to do it. Slower ball on a length, whacks it back down the ground to smash those LED boards before raising his arms and letting out a huge roar"
6623,"FOUR, lovely, sublime timing from batsman, full toss outside off, he waits on it, uses the pace on the ball, plays with an open face and guides it behind square on the off-side, beats Manish and runs away to the fence"
6624,"out Bowled!! Oh dear! The fear of the short ball has consumed batsman once again, a nice little cameo, but nothing else. He pre-empted that Kaul would bowl a short ball and shuffled across his stumps, in the process, he left the leg-stump exposed. This wasn't a short ball, just a length delivery that was heading towards the leg-stump, once batsman clipped and missed, it was curtains for the left-hander. batsman b bowler 22(13) [4s-4]"
6625,"out Bowled!! Two in two for Kaul and team are back in business. Not sure what batsman could have done here, this is simply sensational from Siddarth, the slower ball yorker, moved away off the seam as well, opened up batsman completely as he played for the original angle. The ball curved in and then shaped away beautifully, batsman was through with the shot, the ball gently seamed past the closed bat face and crashed into the base of middle and off-stump. A duck for batsman and Siddarth is on a hat-trick. batsman b bowler 0(1)"
6626,"FOUR, lovely shot, too short from Kaul and he can't afford it at his pace, batsman swivels across, rolls his wrists and pulls it over square leg, no chance for the fielder at long leg"
6627,"out Bowled!! That's big, that's huge and that might have just won this match for team. The wrong 'un from Rashid and MS didn't read it, he was lunging forward, was perhaps looking to push it too square, the ball grazed the inside edge, went through the huge gap between bat and pad and disturbed the stumps. Rashid is thrilled to bits, so are the team camp. They are defending a modest target with elan once again. batsman b bowler 9(18) [4s-1]"
6628,"SIX, risky but much needed for batsman, banged in short and just outside off, batsman was on the back-foot, didn't get hold of the cross-batted slap, just about has enough to clear the man at long leg"
6629,"out Bowled!! Chopped on! Out first ball. Whoa! What.A.Start. Gabbar gone for nought. It was a classic away-swinger, batsman went chasing after that and ended up dragging it back onto his stumps, off the inside edge of course. No room for error from bowler, bowled it on a good length and arrested batsman's feet movement to force an error. A mere push from batsman, just feeling for the ball. batsman b bowler 0(1)"
6630,"FOUR, that's what players like batsman do. Let the bowler bowl to his strengths that is. It was full, but the line's wide of off-stump, KW leans forward and creams the drive wide of mid-off"
6631,"FOUR, seam-up, searching for swing around middle and leg, too easy for batsman as he shuffles to flick that wide of fine leg"
6632,"FOUR, another hit-me on leg-stump, all batsman needed to do was get some bat on that; he spots the line early and manages enough contact to clip that fine for a boundary. A wicket a three fours, an eventful over comes to an end"
6633,"out Caught&Bowled!! Easy peasy! team lose another. Pandey's woeful season continues. Nothing but a dart on middle and leg, might have slightly gripped the surface, Pandey wanted to work it into the on-side and closed the bat face, the leading edge lobs up to the right of bowler, who moves across and ahead of Pathan to gobble that up. batsman c and b bowler 8(16)"
6634,"no run, run-out chance missed. batsman taps the flatter delivery into the on-side and sets off, Pathan is not interested and the big bloke has to turn and run back, Dhoni runs forward, picks the ball and has a shy, misses and batsman survives"
6635,"FOUR, boundary after ages. Much needed one for team. They need to get a move on here. Full and sliding on the pads, Pathan gets enough on the flick to clear Watto at mid-wicket. No chance for the fielder in the deep to cut it off"
6636,"FOUR, excellent placement from Pathan. Waited for the quicker delivery and then back cut it past a diving backward point. Once it beat Bhajji there was no stopping that. Superb spell from bowler, who has come into his own as the tournament has progressed, ends with 4-0-13-1"
6637,"FOUR, Pathan has slowly started to up the ante. Slower short of length delivery and it sat up nicely for Pathan, who forehands the slap in front of square and gives sweeper cover no chance"
6638,"out Caught&Bowled!! You go boy! That is a stunner and deserves the dance moves. Bravo starts his trademark Run The World jig as soon as he completes the catch. Full delivery and Pathan's eyes lit up on seeing it, went full throttle on the drive and didn't even bother to keep it down the ground, struck it hard and low towards Bravo, who had very little time to react, but he did. Went down with both hands but the force was such that it got stuck in the right hand. Another crucial breakthrough for team as they get rid of a set batsman. batsman c and b bowler 24(29) [4s-3]"
6639,"SIX, first six of the innings, taken team 17 overs to smack one out of the park. batsman gets the perfect length delivery, right in his arc to swing it over the deep mid-wicket fence. Went a long way back"
6640,"SIX, back to back sixes. Thakur overcorrects by dragging the length back, but batsman was up for it. In fact, he might have been waiting for it, stands tall and murders the pull over deep mid-wicket"
6641,"SIX, small margins for errors. Thakur missed his yorker and bowled a friendly full toss, batsman was waiting for it with a cleared front leg, nice clean swing of the bat and off she goes sailing over the long-on fence"
6642,"FOUR, wow! What power! This was close to yorker length, but batsman used the depth of the crease nicely, went deep to get underneath it and hammered it over extra cover. There was a fielder in the deep but he had no chance"
6643,"SIX, batsman is walking off thinking it is the end of the over. But someone tells him there's a ball to go. He was off there thinking the job is done. Short and outside off, batsman stands tall and flat-bats it straight over Thakur"
6644,"FOUR, second slip would have gobbled that! Genuine outside edge. Just a push away from the body, the ball swerved away off a good length to click the edge and even a dive from first slip (to his left) wasn't good enough"
6645,"FOUR, smashed! Not an error from the bowler, but that shot was all about batsman's class. Hawkeyed the ball and freed his arms to slaughter the cut through covers"
6646,"3 runs, MS tries a funky flick-the-ball-to-the-stumps and it backfires, Goswami was a goner there! Flicked away to the left of deep square, Bhajji picks it late after a marathon-like sprint and what was batsman thinking there? No three there tbh, but they decided to take on Bhajji's arm. It came flat and high which tempted MSD to try one of his tried-and-tested tacticts to run Goswami out. Unfortunately, missed by a big margin. Goswami wasn't even in the frame"
6647,"out Bhuvneshwar Run Out!! Bhuvneshwar is run-out trying to steal a bye. MS does not miss out on the opportunity. Bouncer on middle and leg, batsman shuffled across, got inside the line and failed to connect with the pull shot, Bhuvneshwar called for the run and he was caught well short. Dhoni hitting the sticks with an under-arm throw. Excellent finish to the team innings though, 20 runs off the final over. Bhuvneshwar run out (Dhoni) 7(11)"
6648,"FOUR, too full and gets slammed! Right in the swinging arc for batsman who times the pants of a flashy drive and gets it in the gap through covers"
6649,"out Caught&Bowled!! Excellent return catch from Ngidi. Ensured he didn't offer any room to batsman there, bowled it on a length and extracted some zip off the pitch; batsman had nowhere to go, went flat and hard, ended up splicing it straight to Ngidi who bent down to claim a clean, low catch. Ngidi is pumped and so is team. batsman c and b bowler 12(9) [4s-2]"
6650,"out Caught by Dhoni!! Is that the game for team? Tom Moody looks stunned. An absolute gift of a wicket this. Short and drifting down leg, batsman senses a boundary-scoring opportunity and gives it a real whack, no bat. It spooned up off the glove and travelled straight into the bucket hands of MS behind the stumps. batsman c Dhoni b bowler 24(15) [4s-4]"
6651,"FOUR, cross-seam delivery, width on offer, batsman stands tall and stabs it through covers. The fielders on the off-side ring stay unmoved"
6652,"FOUR, sits up from back of a length, batsman had all the time in the world to pick his spot; swivels and muscles the pull behind square"
6653,"out Caught by Dhoni!! Strangle down leg episode 2!! team are literally strangling team here. Another team batsman gets out to a poor delivery. It was slow, down leg and asking to be whacked, batsman swivels and tries to oblige, ends up dragging it off his glove which makes a tiny tickle off his thigh pad before nestling into Dhoni's mitts. team are on fire.... batsman c Dhoni b bowler 12(10) [4s-2]"
6654,"FOUR, batsman wastes no time in getting away. Backs away to this flatter ball, to make room, and bashes it through the covers. team are away"
6655,"out Stumped!! bowler has his revenge instantly! After the last boundary, I was beginning to think that team have missed a trick by giving bowler the new ball, again, with batsman on strike. But hasn't the off spinner justified the decision or what! Clever bowling, expected batsman to give the charge and hung it up in the air a touch more on a slightly shorter length. The West Indian didn't bother adjusting to the length, that's not his way anyway and goes through with the shot. A bit of grip off the surface and whizzes past the edge. Easy for Klaasen. batsman st Klaasen b bowler 4(2) [4s-1]"
6656,"byes, FOUR, that's beaten everyone! Lots of turn on this off break and batsman brings out the reverse sweep to combat it. Cannot connect and Klaasen didn't anticipate the spin either. Races away"
6657,"FOUR, and now young Gill takes a leaf out of his skipper's book. The seam-up ball that held its line just outside off, Gill is pretty glued to the crease and smartly just uses the pace of the bowler to guide it to third man. Beats Sodhi on this occasion, who tried his best but couldn't stop it"
6658,"FOUR, there's that customary dragger from the leggie. Rare loose ball, short and width for the taking, Gill carves his bat staying deep and finds the gap, beats point"
6659,"SIX, Gill is getting a move on. Knew what was coming from Gopal, it was the juicy leg-break. Gill charges out and tonks it through the line over long-off. Archer can only watch it sail over his head for a maximum"
6660,"SIX, this maximum brings the 50-stand up for the duo. Another drag down delivery from Gopal, comes off the final ball of his spell. batsman sees it early, pivots back and smacks it over cow corner. Feel for Gopal, he's bowled so well, just that lost his line and lengths in his last over"
6661,"FOUR, Eden Gardens is loving it. Fearsome striking by Gill. No margin for error at all, Archer errs by giving him the width, Gill stands tall and crashes it through extra cover. Fierce!"
6662,"out Caught by Klaasen!! And does him next ball. Archer retaliates. Sticks to his strengths. Keeps it short and cramps Gill for room and space. Gill was backing away, in a bid to slash it through point. Is defeated by the extra bounce and zip. Gets a faint nick and Klaasen nestles it in his gloves. The partnership has been broken and team lose half their side. batsman c Klaasen b bowler 28(17) [4s-3 6s-1]"
6663,"SIX, wades into Archer. Just cannot bowl there for Russell. Goes full and at the stumps, Russell takes his front leg out of the way and dismisses it over long-on. Sheer disdain"
6664,"SIX, top-edge but it's that sort of an edge that batsman loves. Unorthodoxy by batsman, moves across to hoick it across the line with a horizontal bat. A fat top-edge is found and it's going only one way. Over the keeper's head and off she goes for half-a-dozen. Fifty up for the skipper, much vital this for the team. Raises his bat and the dug-out in all applauses"
6665,"SIX, bowler's nightmarish day continues. Cutter to Russell? Too full and Russell feasts on it. Sets up a low stance and hacks it violently through mid-wicket. Flat and the deep mid-wicket fielder was lining up, but it cleared Samson in the end. Hits his fingertips and parries over. Brutal"
6666,"FOUR, bowler is not learning. Just shortens his length and keeps it outside off, Russell reaches out and slaps it through extra cover. Rocketed away to the fence"
6667,"out Caught by Rahane!! Eden Gardens is shellshocked. Reason - batsman perishes. bowler strikes gold and is pumped. The top-of-the-hand slower ball, on a fuller length. batsman was shaping up for a biff across the line, loses his shape and loses his timing as well. Slicing it up in the air towards extra cover. Rahane keeps his eyes on the ball, back-pedals and holds on. batsman c Rahane b bowler 52(38) [4s-4 6s-2]"
6668,"SIX, incredible! How do you bowl to this guy? bowler digs in the slower short ball, Russell stayed back but had to generate some power to clear the deep mid-wicket fielder. Gets more than enough to power it into the crowd"
6669,"SIX, woah. Change up from bowler, ushers in the pacy bouncer at Russell's torso. Took the gamble but didn't come off well. Russell pulls it over his head and dismisses it over fine leg. All the way!"
6670,"SIX, phew! That bat-speed and the muscle power from Russell. Didn't get it off the middle but it hardly matters to him. The back of the hand slower ball, rising up and Russell forehand swats it over long-off. Sends it a long way over long-off. Came off the bottom, still dispatched it for a maximum. How?"
6671,"FOUR, misses the length and Russell makes him pay. Clears his front leg, unleashes his bottom hand and whacks it across the line, the practice pitches help his cause. Trickles away wide of long-on"
6672,"out Caught by Jofra Archer!! bowler hoodwinking the batsmen with his canny slower balls. This was on a length around off, batsman swung it hard, lost his shape and skied it as far as long-off. Two fielders were converging and Archer completes the catch in the end running forward. A dot ball but Russell gets back on strike. Blessing in disguise? Eh? batsman c Jofra Archer b bowler 2(5)"
6673,"FOUR, wow! Bludgeoned away. Russell gets deep in his crease, bowler fails to nail the yorker. And Russell caresses it through extra cover"
6674,"out Caught&Bowled!! Soft, soft dismissal! bowler is on a roll here! It's batsman who has to go and another massive blow to team. This was tossed up generously and perhaps held onto the pitch a tad. batsman didn't help his cause by trying to work across the line. The leading edge balloons towards bowler who just has to leap a touch from his tall frame to grab the return catch. The hosts have been jolted here at Eden Gardens. It's all happening. batsman c and b bowler 3(7)"
6675,"FOUR, bludgeoned away! Typical brute force from Lynn. He had been trying to break free for a while now and finally, gets one away. Not much room, but he makes some by backing away and smacks it away through the gap at cover. Nobody moved"
6676,"out Caught by Unadkat!! Atrocious from Rana! Another one bites the dust and team are clearly struggling at the moment. They aren't helping their cause either by not adapting to this surface. Short of a length from Archer and Rana once again backs away, like he did previous ball. What he also did, was to try a weird slog that was never a percentage stroke on this pitch. Only manages it high, off the inside half of the bat, towards mid-on. batsman c Unadkat b bowler 3(5)"
6677,"FOUR, beautifully timed! batsman is away with a sublime stroke. Half volley on the pads, he latches onto it with a wristy flick that's placed quite wide of the fine leg fielder"
6678,"FOUR, up and over! Loosener from bowler to start with, wide half volley and batsman just ensures that he clears the infield. That he does so with a front-footed lofted chip over cover. Easily done"
6679,"FOUR, cracking stroke! The previous one was a bad ball but this is just a stunning shot. There was width but on a length, batsman just went through on the front foot and thumped the drive on the up. Bisected mid-off and extra cover easily"
6680,"FOUR, Lynn joins the party. Have to say that bowler is releasing all the pressure built with some poor bowling. Once again gifts width outside off and Lynn was waiting for this for a while now. Frees his arms to go over cover. Didn't middle that well but still had enough to go over the infield"
6681,"out Caught&Bowled!! Another return catch. There were a few at the Wankhede yesterday and the Eden surface is creating the same havoc. The googly from Gopal which sticks onto the pitch a touch, Lynn wanted to work it away off the back foot but could only spoon it back to the leg spinner. A scratchy innings from the Australian. Never looked comfortable on this pitch. Right then, that means more responsibility for DK. batsman c and b bowler 18(22) [4s-2]"
6682,"FOUR, deft by batsman. This is sliding down leg and on the shorter side as well. He just gets across to get a tickle that beats Klaasen. Quick outfield and short fine leg's chase is in vain"
6683,"SIX, ah Jinks. Gets a wide-short combo, batsman rocks back, sways, but the hands are quick to pounce on. Cuts, airy and that Centurion-2003 moment as it flies into deep point"
6684,"FOUR, feeds the pads. batsman gets on his toes, shuffling inside the line and whippy hands in flicking it in front of square. The class .. sheer tons of it"
6685,"1 run, the partnership between batsman and Rahane is now 50. Uppish tuck to an in-ducker and has been fielded at deep mid. A single"
6686,"SIX, that is a jail-break from batsman! Retaliation from the batter as he camped back to smoke a sixer over deep mid. That was gargantuan from the young man and 61 is needed now. team, more importantly batsman, needed that"
6687,"out Caught&Bowled!! The time-out has struck. That was a flighted ball, the batsman skews the sweep back and the bowler does the rest. Caught and bowled is trending. The googly dipped, spun a little and the lack of pace from the wicket also helped. Huge strike for team. They are back in this. batsman c and b bowler 46(41) [4s-4 6s-1]"
6688,"FOUR, the reverse sweep! Played with disdain as he lofted it high over short third man for a four. He did it against the Indian spinners in South Africa. Rang a bell?"
6689,"FOUR, low full toss, trying for a yorker but gets it wrong. That was 120kph! The batsman though stays calm, maintains his shape and open-faces the ball over cover for a four. The deep cover was too straight. Three men were around the point region"
6690,"1 run, uppish tuck, awkwardly done but fifty it is from the young man. In the night of the eliminator, he has come good. Gutsy knock from him"
6691,"out Caught by Searles!! Gone. Taken at long-on. That was dragged short, quicker as well. The batsman went for the pull but there was no distance on it. A lot of elevation though and was taken in the deep. Huge strike again from team. They keep dragging this back. The batsman got a bit carried away with the length I guess but the half-trackers have done the job in this edition of the IPL. batsman c Searles b bowler 50(38) [4s-4 6s-2]"
6692,"out Caught by Chris Lynn!! Slower dipping full toss and the slog sweep, sans any power, finds the man at square leg. Huge wicket or a blessing in disguise for team? Tough to say. It would bring in Gowtham. Three dot balls from him will hurt team. But my word, this boy is special. Nailed the blockhole stuff and slower balls to perfection. batsman c Chris Lynn b bowler 0(3)"
6693,"FOUR, rare float up. So unlike bowler .. wide, asking for treatment. And obliged. Tripathi reaches out to the pitch, clearing his back leg and then full flowing hands as he drills it through the covers"
6694,"no run, quick skidder. batsman's done in, struck on his pad. And the umpire gives into bowler's celebratory LBW appeal. Tripathi doesn't allow him to leave, forces him to review. So batsman's well deep in the crease, doesn't read the googly, is beaten on pace as well. But he's struck on the front pad. And yes .. the angle is enough to take it down leg."
6695,"FOUR, mark the calendar! team vs team - 25th May! team win this by 25 runs as they did the choking act much better than team in the death overs. team's dream run has been stalled. The last ball was short, the pull was not controlled but went fine on the on-side for a four. Did not matter"
6696,"FOUR, 134.1kph. Sitting up in the slot, nicely getting onto the hips at a good height for batsman to latch. Does it with a swiping glance, getting airborne and pinching the mid-wicket gap"
6697,"FOUR, typical overcompensate. After a drifter into the pads, Krishna goes into a bouncer, wide outside off. batsman has his timing tonight, and enough on it to jump-cut it square. The powerplay's enough to do its bit"
6698,"SIX, there's long-on. But why bother when you can time it like this. bowler tosses his carrom ball full, Tripathi's down on a knee already. And smoking it .. 20 rows back"
6699,"SIX, it can get longer. Tripathi makes his 'V' bigger, clears his leg, sits as usual. And it's for cow corner's crowds to try and grab that lakh"
6700,"no run, massive inside edge. But DK's desperation in the carnage forces him to go upstairs. So Tripathi's pinned on the back foot. And yes .. it's a big chunk of the wood onto his pad"
6701,"out Caught&Bowled!! Oh bowler. Ignore that stout frame, he has a habit of plucking one-handed stunners - surely when he's the bowler. Tripathi couldn't have defended it with harder hands, he gets all traditional in a front foot block. And the ball instead of dying down, ends up being the wrong 'un, takes the splice and pops up to bowler's right, who's palm stuck out is enough. batsman c and b bowler 20(13) [4s-1 6s-2]"
6702,"FOUR, no batsman ain't cheeky enough for these late cuts. Just can't line himself up right, just about fetches it out of DK's gloves as he outside-edges it past the cordon. Ah, never mind"
6703,"FOUR, juicy half tracker. batsman waits, waits some more. And some more. Loads up a pull, with all the muscle to swat it away through mid-wicket"
6704,"FOUR, rubs in some more elegance. Clears his back leg, reads the flight, reads the googly and inside-outs it over extra cover. Oh Kolkata need the breather .. time-out"
6705,"SIX, 122.9kph of a filthy nothing. batsman stays up tall, swinging horizontally. Picks up the empty mid-wicket and a 68-meter hit will do"
6706,"FOUR, more width. batsman's as good as most with flat-bats. This time he's carving them behind point. Absolute crunch"
6707,"FOUR, length ball wide outside off, a horizontal-batted crash to deep point for four. They're away"
6708,"FOUR, full delivery sliding towards the on-side, a tickle away to fine leg for four. @143.6km/h, good pace"
6709,"FOUR, no frickin' way! Lady luck can't possibly be so mean! Back of a length outside off, jumps up and catches batsman by surprise, who gets a leading edge which, believe me, goes through the gap at deep backward point for four"
6710,"out Bowled!! That's not very smart from batsman, his flattened leg-stump tells him the same. The very first ball he faces from Rashid, he tries to reverse-sweep him premeditatedly. It was too full to be doing that. The ball slid on under his bat and crashed his wicket away. Off you go, says Rashid with a twirl of his wrist. batsman b bowler 2(8)"
6711,"FOUR, Lynn has made his mind up. He isn't deviating from it. This is what he'll do, live or die. Length ball at the stumps, and he sweeps it away through square leg. It was uppish, and there was a fielder in the ring, but he got it to his left"
6712,"FOUR, beautiful footwork from batsman, so nimble. He's been in such sublime form. The length is short, which he picks in a flash, and pummels the pull through mid-wicket"
6713,"out Bowled!! What a massive wicket! Sunrisers are absolutely pumped, with bowler furiously swinging his hand in celebration. Oh, this form. Such a tricky thing. batsman gets carried away a touch, tries cutting a ball from off-stump and chops it back onto leg. The length wasn't short either, and his balance just wasn't there as he was leaning backward in trying to manufacture the room which wasn't there. This match is well and truly alive. batsman b bowler 8(6) [4s-1]"
6714,"out Lbw!! Lynn falls sweeping. That was his ploy against spin. He was aware of the dangers associated with it, and was willing to take them anyway. Rashid's googly skids back in sharply and hits him on the knee-roll in front of off and middle. Plumb. What a turnaround this. batsman lbw b bowler 48(31) [4s-6 6s-2]"
6715,"no run, is that a drop? Arm-ball, slides back in and probably takes an inside-edge onto pad before popping towards Saha who never gets his gloves in the right place. bowler with a priceless reaction, collapsing at the bowler's end"
6716,"out Caught by Dhawan!! What has Russell done here. What has he done? He can't believe it. Takes a moment to himself, before striding back into the pavilion. Flat googly turning in from outside off, Russell decides to go for a big cut, just unable to resist his attacking instincts. He's too cramped up to get it away, the ball fizzes off the edge, straight into the hands of Dhawan at slip. bowler, wow. batsman c Dhawan b bowler 3(7)"
6717,"FOUR, stunning timing from batsman! Back of length outside off, Gill didn't even go through with this back foot punch. He checks the shot late, but it skims off the sweet spot to beat Williamson at extra cover"
6718,"SIX, clears the front leg to this length ball and muscles it over mid-wicket. Length ball from Khaleel, right into batsman's arc. 14 off the over to revive team's chase"
6719,"FOUR, bowler dared to put his hands up, but he wasn't stopping this. A bit short of the blockhole this time, Gill accentuates the error by going deep in his crease and drills it hard and straight. Keeps team breathing"
6720,"out Bowled!! Off-stump ripped off! Kaul points to the heavens. Williamson claps. team leap closer. Full ball on middle, batsman eyes an inside-out drive after clearing his front leg but only gets an outside edge to send the ball smashing into the off pole. batsman b bowler 12(12) [6s-1]"
6721,"1 run, this is unbelievable bowling under pressure. Yorker on off, Mavi jams it to short cover and then they run, because they have to, and not because it was on. Direct-hit would have ended Gill and with him, team's hopes"
6722,"SIX, and clears long-off! Gill has ensured that there will still be some pressure on the weaker bowling option - whoever that is, when the final over starts. Full ball outside off, Gill is deep in the crease to smash it back down the ground. Powers it into the crowd"
6723,"FOUR, how are the nerves now team? How are the nerves now Carlos? Full ball outside off, Mavi slices it away over backward point"
6724,"out Caught by Rashid Khan!! Slogs, connects hard and flat, but picks out deep mid-wicket, and who should it be there. Of course Rashid Khan. To bowler's credit, he bowled this pretty full and prevented Mavi from getting much elevation. team will at least have Gill on strike. batsman c Rashid Khan b bowler 6(4) [4s-1]"
6725,"out Caught by Rashid Khan!! Rashid Khan has gobbled this up like a candy in the deep. What ridiculous ease. Full ball on leg stump from round the wicket, bowler's round the wicket angle cramped Gill up meaning that there was no power behind the shot. He merely chipped it up. Rashid settles under it, around five yards in front of the boundary, and swallows it. batsman c Rashid Khan b bowler 30(20) [4s-2 6s-1]"
6726,"SIX, slower one at 127km/h, length ball outside off, child's play for Lynn, who smokes this flat over deep extra cover for six"
6727,"FOUR, 3rd full-toss from Bhuvi! Low full-toss around off, batsman punches that to sweeper cover for four. Pure timing!"
6728,"SIX, length ball outside off, batsman effortlessly tonks it over long-off for six! Just over the rope..."
6729,"FOUR, wow, Bhuvi under pressure straight away! Is batsman the new Jayasuriya? A back of a length delivery drifting into the pads, a slog across the line, and a thick inside edge to backward square leg for four"
6730,"FOUR, another back of a length ball, and just cross-batted disdainfully over the bowler's head for four. No respect!"
6731,"out Caught by Brathwaite!! Knuckle ball by Kaul does the trick! Full delivery on middle and leg, batsman was always trying to get under it and loft it away over long-on, but gets a mile of height on it, but not distance. Brathwaite settles under it and lets out a roar, and somewhere hidden underneath it, a sigh of relief. batsman c Brathwaite b bowler 26(13) [4s-4 6s-1]"
6732,"FOUR, full toss down leg, tickled away to fine leg for four"
6733,"SIX, fractionally short, skidding outside off, batsman could've done that without an ounce of muscle in his forearms, cheekily steers that upper cut over the jumping giant (Brathwaite) at third man for six"
6734,"SIX, into the stratosphere and back! Oh these massive top-edges! Bat regulations who? Shortish and angling into the body, batsman turns on his heels into a Ganguly-pull towards fine leg as the spectators' have a deja-vu. High into the sky and lands just over fine leg"
6735,"SIX, length ball outside off, batsman gets out of the way, gives himself room, and launches this over long-off for an 85-meter six"
6736,"no run, interesting stuff. team have gone for the review for LBW. Leg-break straightening and the sweep takes the glove on it's way! The appeal was for an LBW, but there was glove on it. It actually came off the glove, but the keeper has dropped it."
6737,"1 run, back of a length delivery on the hips, dropped off the back foot to square leg where Williamson picks up and throws at the non-striker's end. He wasn't even in the frame when the ball crossed the stumps. Terrible running from Rana"
6738,"FOUR, short and wide, batsman slashes at it, gets it over the infield towards third man for four"
6739,"FOUR, wide half-volley outside off, batsman has his feet glued to the turf and lofts it towards sweeper cover for four. Lands about a centimeter short of the rope"
6740,"FOUR, flat and angling towards middle, batsman switches his stance into a right-hander's, reverse-sweeps to third man for four"
6741,"out batsman Run Out!! 1 run completed. You've gotta be kidding me! Full ball nurdled away towards deep mid-wicket, Rashid (who can't be kept out of the game) fires in the throw at the keeper's end. Rana, who slipped at the non-striker's end, ran to the danger end (the striker's end) for the fatal second run and was caught just marginally short. Throws his bat in disgust as he walks back, embarrassed. batsman run out (Rashid Khan/Saha) 22(16) [4s-1 6s-2]"
6742,"no run, batsman is looking very nervous, pushes a length ball straight to Uthappa at short extra-cover and set-off for a quick single. Dhawan wasn't coming this time, batsman has to turn around, put the dive and make his ground"
6743,"FOUR, lovely, batsman is sweeping Kuldeep into frustration, this was very full and well wide of off, batsman bent down low and then swept it in front of square on the on-side. Lynn was very square on the on-side and even a big dive can't help him pull the ball back into play"
6744,"FOUR, boundaries starting to flow for team. They need to move on here. bowler has been too full today and this was no different, googly overpitched and batsman drills the drive through extra cover. The fielder at long-off didn't even bother to chase"
6745,"out Stumped!! batsman is waiting. Not sure why? They are checking whether Karthik has the ball in his gloves, he does. It pops out after the stumps are broken. So that is fine. TV umpire is having multiple looks. Why is he taking so much time? The square leg umpire had raised the finger and just because batsman stood his ground, the umpires went upstairs. Finally, we have a decision and it is OUT. The Eden crowd had to wait for almost three minutes to start their celebration. The googly and batsman hung back to nudge it into the on-side, gets an inside edge onto the under side of the thigh pad and the ball rolls back towards Karthik, batsman was taking off for the run and by the time he saw where the ball was, DK had broken the stumps. The ball did slip out of his grasp, but that was after he had lit the LEDs. batsman st Karthik b bowler 35(27) [4s-5]"
6746,"FOUR, batsman backed away to free his arms and unlike Narine, bowler tosses it up on the stumps, right sort of room to play the drive and batsman places it perfectly past extra cover, even beat long-off to his right"
6747,"FOUR, half tracker and batsman makes him pay. There was ample width as well, batsman reached out and flayed the cut behind square on the off-side, no chance for the sweeper cover to get across"
6748,"FOUR, now to the other side of the ground. Bit more air and batsman fetches the sweep from outside off, he rolled his wrists to place it in front square on the leg-side - right between deep mid-wicket and long-on"
6749,"out Shakib Run Out!! team keep chipping away at the wickets. Just when the partnership had started to built, they have got rid of the set batsman. Floaty delivery and Deepak clears his front leg to have a clean swing at that, drills it straight back and Kuldeep gets a fingertip on it before the ball crashes into the stumps. Shakib was backing up and he had no time to make his way back. Caught well short of the crease. Shakib is disappointed and keeps shaking his head as he makes his way to the dugout. Shakib run out (bowler) 28(24) [4s-4]"
6750,"SIX, Hooda is not bothered with a wicket or the break. First ball after the break and he sends it soaring over the fence for a maximum. Tossed up delivery on a fullish length, Hooda just went through the line and lofted it handsomely over long-on"
6751,"out Caught by Chawla!! Well, the conventional sweep didn't work so lets try the reverse sweep. It still doesn't come off and Hooda has to go. The off-break from bowler and kept turning into Hooda, who shaped to play the reverse sweep/pull, fetched it from outside leg and spliced it towards backward point. Chawla ran back a few yards and reverse cupped it. In fact, Hooda changed his grip and tried the switch hit. batsman c Chawla b bowler 19(19) [6s-1]"
6752,"SIX, that is the problem with yorkers, you can't miss it by much. Nice juicy full toss and batsman said thank you very much by depositing it into the cow corner fence for half a dozen"
6753,"out batsman Run Out!! 1 run completed. Brilliant bit of work from Rana. batsman is down on the floor and he takes ages to make his way back. Very full and almost close to the yorker length, batsman slices it with an open bat face wide of short third man, Rana runs to his left from deep backward point, flings full length to stop the ball and then bullets a flat throw right next to the stumps to Karthik. There was never a second and even though batsman put in the dive, he was well short. Huge wicket at this stage for team. They have removed one of the big hitters. batsman run out (Nitish Rana/Karthik) 8(4) [6s-1]"
6754,"FOUR, streaky! But that is the way Rashid plays. Short and outside off, he just threw the kitchen sink at it and the top-edge flies over a leaping Karthik. Big over for team, but the loss of Brathwaite would hurt them"
6755,"out Caught by Chawla!! Now Pathan is gone. team are on fire. They are catching everything, running batsman out and bowling to their fields. Full and outside off, Pathan thought it was in his range and went for the loft over long-off, got it off the toe-end and skied it towards deep cover. It was in the air for a long time and Chawla held his nerve to cling on. batsman c Chawla b bowler 3(7)"
6756,"SIX, Chawla in action again and this time he parries it over. Misjudged it completely. Rashid charged down and threw everything at the back of a length delivery, sliced it towards sweeper cover and Chawla ran forward to take the catch, got fingertips to it and parried it over. Had he stood his ground, it was coming straight to him"
6757,"SIX, Rashid is playing a blinder here. And he still has one over to go. Can he get team to 165-170? Full and outside off, Rashid reaches out for it, down on knee and smashing it a long way back into the deep extra cover stand. A top order batsman would have been proud of that shot"
6758,"FOUR, good start to the over, some glove love as well between Bhuvi and Rashid. Short and outside off, Bhuvi arches back and carves the cut over backward point. No one out there to stop that from reaching the fence"
6759,"FOUR, lovely batting from Rashid. It was the slower delivery and he didn't try to overhit it, saw mid-off inside the circle and delayed his loft for a second, struck it cleanly and got a one bounce four"
6760,"SIX, oh geez! ""This is the shot of the innings,"" calls Sanjay M on air and couldn't agree more. Full on off, Rashid went deep in the crease and whipped it with all his bottom hand over deep backward square. It was just a flick of the wrists and the pace of bowler took care of the rest"
6761,"SIX, cracking shot, that should get batsman and team off and running, a friendly length ball on batsman's pads, he picked it up, used bowler's pace and clipped it high and behind square on the on-side, went a long way over the ropes for a maximum"
6762,"1 run, chance and dropped, DK with the big gloves called for the catch, Lynn - who was very near the ball moved away and then the captain shells it. That's a bad miss from DK, coming to the ball, it was another ugly slog from batsman, got it off the toe-end, very high and towards square leg. Karthik had plenty of time, but the ball seemed to swirl away at the very end and that perhaps put him off"
6763,"SIX, Rashid, you beauty! He has given team the total they were looking for. 24 runs off the final over. Just what the doctor order for team. It was the slow off-cutter and Rashid picked the bones out of that, waited for it and thumped it over the long-on fence for a maximum. Tom Moody, the team coach, now affords a smile and has a word with Williamson"
6764,"FOUR, smashed, Saha had to jump and get out of the way, it was coming at a rate of knots, back of a length delivery outside off, batsman got forward and absolutely drilled it back at the non-striker, no need to run for those"
6765,"FOUR, lovely, four men in that off-side ring and still batsman manages to pierce the gap. The slower ball from Russell, a hint of width on offer and batsman was all over it, crashes it square past cover-point and watches it hit the ropes"
6766,"FOUR, edged and four, handy runs for batsman, back of a length and rising onto the batsman, batsman didn't get on top of the bounce, was looking to cut, gets a thick edge that runs away past the lone slip"
6767,"FOUR, cracking shot, that might help batsman break the shackles, on a good length and just outside off, he plonked his front-foot forward and lifted it through the line, over mid-wicket and almost all the way, bounced just in front of the ropes"
6768,"FOUR, lovely shot, very full from bowler, right in the zone for batsman, he gets his front-foot forward and drills it to the left of the umpire. The two fielders in the deep have no chance"
6769,"1 run, tossed up well outside off, batsman bends down low and sweeps it towards deep mid-wicket for a single"
6770,"FOUR, cracking shot, bowler has been too full this over, batsman gets forward, gets close to the ball and drills it back past the non-striker, even a big dive at long-off can't stop the ball, it was Prasidh there"
6771,"out Lbw!! Kuldeep is on all fours and on the ground, but he has a wicket first-ball. This is as plumb as it gets, batsman is gutted with himself as he walks back to the hut, didn't even consider reviewing it, it was as dead as one gets. Coming to the ball, this was nicely floated around middle, a hint of shape and that was enough to beat the batsman, batsman was shaping for the sweep, the ball was too full for that, he missed and was struck on the back-thigh, adjacent to middle-stump. It was going to crash into middle and umpire Nitin Menon has one of the easier LBW decisions of his career. batsman lbw b bowler 34(24) [4s-4 6s-1]"
6772,"out Caught by Karthik!! Two wickets in the over and Kuldeep is on a roll. The wrong 'un and batsman has been done in completely. He has a word with his partner, but decides against a review, off he goes. Is this the game turning over? Coming to the ball, this was nicely tossed up around off, batsman prodded forward on the drive, but unlike the previous ball - he didn't get to the pitch of it. The bat hit the ground, the ball caught the outside edge and Karthik completes a fine catch. batsman c Karthik b bowler 3(3)"
6773,"FOUR, beautifully played, a rare bad ball from team tonight, a floaty half-volley outside off, batsman leans into the shot, finds the gap past cover and watches it roll away to the fence"
6774,"no run, appeal for LBW and Kuldeep prods his captain to go for the review. It's a fair delivery and replays suggest that there was some bat on that. Ultraedge confirms it and team have lost their review. This was very full and on the leg-stump line, batsman was looking to sweep and the inside edge perhaps saved him"
6775,"FOUR, nicely played by batsman, Narine gave up the chase very early, this was tossed up on middle, batsman went down low, used the pace on the ball and lapped it fine, beat short fine and rolled away to the fence"
6776,"FOUR, punched away off the back foot with a slightly horizontal bat. Stays forward and takes care of the shortish ball. Not too short and the batsman thumped the ball away. He is in good form"
6777,"FOUR, round the wicket, fired down leg, batsman tries a sweep, gets a tickle on it to get it away to (extremely) fine leg for four. Almost long stop. Runs coming in a hurry for team"
6778,"SIX, over the wicket, odd angle for Shaks, batsman gets low and plays a hybrid sweepull over backward square leg for six. Fifty up for Watto! Big match, and the big man stands up!"
6779,"SIX, tossed up on an enticing length outside off, batsman reaches out and gets to the pitch, check-lofts it over long-on for six! batsman turning it on in a big match!"
6780,"FOUR, this will do. This will do for team. Slower ball but bowler landed that way too short, pulled powerfully through mid-wicket and it's well wide of the fielder in the deep"
6781,"FOUR, low full toss and he's crashed that over extra-cover, the shoulders are dropping in the Orange camp. The yellow in the stands is very bright. batsman got down low on his knees and loft-drove that"
6782,"SIX, oh my word! How on earth has he managed to hit that so well and so cleanly? This is actually a slower ball very well disguised by bowler, batsman was beaten for pace, almost was early into the shot, but managed somehow to reach out and muscle the ball over long-on"
6783,"SIX, and he's not done yet! Don't bowl full tosses sir! At least not when he's in this mood. batsman waits for the ball and smashes it over the mid-wicket boundary"
6784,"SIX, hat-trick of sixes. He's carrying a niggle, but he's hitting them cleanly. Gee, what a turnaround this has been been. Took 11 balls to get off the mark and now he's 82 off 44. Length ball and batsman blasts that over long-on"
6785,"FOUR, oh this is sublime batting from batsman. Knows bowler is going for the wide yorker with third man inside the ring and he smartly squeezes it in the gap between short third man and backward point. A massive 27-run-game-killing over"
6786,"out Caught by Goswami!! That's the end of a fantastic 117-run stand. Sharp bouncer from bowler. We all know batsman has a problem with the short ball, glad team thought about it too. This was a really good steepler cramping batsman on the half-hook shot, was almost trying to evade, the ball catches the glove and Goswami jumps to catch the ball. The appeal was confident, umpire Marais Erasmus said no. team went for the review and batsman walked off without waiting for the replays because he knew he hit that. batsman c Goswami b bowler 32(24) [4s-3 6s-1]"
6787,"FOUR, audacious is the word for this shot. The bowler runs in and bowls a pacy length ball, this lad doesn't move and just opens the face of the bat at the very last moment to beat the diving short third man fielder. He's playing around with the bowlers and the fielders"
6788,"SIX, he wants to finish this early. He is just a hit away from a hundred now. Back of a length delivery on the stumps, batsman pulls and clears deep mid-wicket"
6789,"no run, googly from bowler, batsman reads off the surface and plays off the back foot, gets hit on the pad first before the ball touched the bat, but batsman was well outside the line of off stump, review wasted"
6790,"SIX, two dot balls and batsman has had enough. Runs at the bowler and nonchalantly lofts it over wide long-off, easily clears the rope"
6791,"1 run, take a bow, Shane Robert batsman. He becomes the fourth player to have two or more hundreds in an IPL season. If at all you are struggling in life, just watch this innings folks. This is a serious life lesson. He couldn't time the ball, was only hitting it to hand, was getting beaten, his first run came off the 11th ball he faced, but he didn't lose heart. Backed himself like his captain always does and he now has a hundred off 51 balls. When his trigger is that slight movement backwards with a gentle hop of the front leg, you know as a bowler he's in the zone. He switched gears and muscled all the bowlers around. The hundred ball though was just a gentle push to the left of cover and off comes the helmet, great applause from the crowd and the team dugout and soaks them all in with his hands aloft"
6792,"FOUR, cheeky, gets inside the line of this googly and paddles it past the man at short fine leg, this is clever batting from batsman"
6793,"FOUR, the fielder at deep backward square leg has misjudged this. batsman slogged this in the air, the fielder dived but couldn't get there. On the biggest night, team have negated bowler without a wicket"
6794,"FOUR, oh that's a bowler-killer. Luckily it didn't come very straight at Kaul. Very full from Kaul, batsman drills it hard and beats long-off"
6795,"FOUR, and he's doing it in style. Kaul tries the yorker and batsman drives it straight and hard, Kaul takes his leg out of the way to save himself and the ball rockets to the boundary"
6796,"FOUR, that's it! Chennai Super Kings are champions of IPL for the third time. What a brilliant return to the stage this is from team after a two-year ban. The players rush to the middle to mob Watson. Meanwhile, captain Dhoni is gently walking around with a gentle smile of his"
6797,"FOUR, full, too full and biffed! Murdered down the ground past the bowler for a four. The man at mid-off had no chance"
6798,out Caught&Bowled!! The slower ball and that lands a wicket. The ball holds up thanks to knuckle ball and the lifted hit finds the bowler's hands. The bowler called for it and takes it. He charged out and tried to go aerial but never timed it. Watson's dot ball a reason for this? Might well be. team are off to the worst possible start. batsman c and b bowler 10(11) [4s-1]
6799,"SIX, biffed away! That goes the journey as it was dragged slightly short. The seam up delivery came on to the bat nicely and was in the arc for the batsman to put it away over deep square leg. team breaking the shackles?"
6800,"FOUR, full delivery and the batsman has pile-driven the ball down the ground. The man at mid-off was wide enough for the ball to fly into the fence on a bounce"
6801,"SIX, oh a horror of a delivery by Kaul! A length ball angling into the pads, batsman just has to flick it away over deep backward square leg for six! Watto has started to find the meat. A neat and violent pick-up shot..."
6802,"FOUR, short one from over the wicket, batsman just has to guide the pull to fine leg for four. Easy pickings"
6803,"FOUR, just a fraction short towards leg-stump, batsman twists his torso into another late pull to fine leg for four. Excellent over for team!"
6804,"SIX, looked like another slower one, batsman doesn't try anything straight batted this time (wary of the knuckle ball) and cross-bats that over long-on for six. Muscled."
6805,"2 runs, falls short of Rash at sweeper cover. Low full toss just outside off, batsman is down on his knees and gets under it to slice it towards sweeper cover where Rashid tries to take it. It falls just short. 50 partnership up!"
6806,"FOUR, short-ish delivery outside off, batsman reaches out and cross-bats the loft towards long-off for four. Falls only just inside the rope"
6807,"FOUR, Karn Sharma might have saved a few for team. Ngidi errs in line, on the hips and batsman glances it towards fine leg. Karn was square and had a lot of ground to cover, he runs to his left and puts in the full length dive, flicks the ball in play. Third umpire has a look and sees that he is in contact with the ad cushions, first boundary off the final"
6808,"out batsman Run Out!! 1 run completed. Needless! This is a gift from team. Never a second in it and batsman is well short of the crease. The team fans at Wankhede explode. Short of length delivery, batsman jumps and tucks it backward of square leg, he wanted the second and pushed Dhawan for it, Karn ran in from long leg and fired a flat throw right next to the stumps, easy peasy for Dhoni. batsman was couple of yards short. batsman run out (Karn Sharma/Dhoni) 5(5)"
6809,"FOUR, a leaping Ngidi .. and if something evades him, it's never a catch good enough to be called a drop. batsman half-dabs, off the outer half and short third man can only try"
6810,"SIX, umm. Sitting up in the slot, and batsman's sitting too. Full-swing, slogging it into cow corner"
6811,"FOUR, and he drills it better. It's fuller, it's wider, but batsman's back on his knee, slapping it much straighter. Yea, there's nobody at long-on"
6812,"FOUR, oh these hands. Bravo keeps dishing out full-paced stuff, and overcooks don't help his cause either. batsman shuffles, leaning to bottom-hand it into extra cover"
6813,"FOUR, some more. Bravo decides to compensate, dragging in a half tracker. batsman's way too smart to see through these ploys .. stays back tall, heaving it away. And mid-wicket will only chase"
6814,"out Stumped!! That's why you need these leggies. So all batsman can manage is going past Gayle and Hussey. And no more. Karn is watching batsman's feet, he's reading his head, he knows it's his time to charge down. And fires it wide, well outside off, spinning big. Under the desperate attempt in the end to squeeze it out. Well MS has a deal with the speed of light, and an equally good equation with stumpings. batsman st Dhoni b bowler 47(36) [4s-5 6s-2]"
6815,"FOUR, woah. He can get cheeky too. Lets the ball get big beside, uses up the width and cuts, fine, very fine"
6816,"FOUR, oh my. You really don't bowl wide to Yusuf, you surely don't bowl short sitter to Yusuf. But when you do both, Yusuf can slap, powering it square"
6817,"SIX, airy, long and 82 meters. Karn tries teasing out another floater well outside off, Yusuf doesn't bother getting out, sits and slices it up and several rows into extra cover"
6818,"FOUR, that massive front foot clear, and then those hands. Absolutely crunches this carve away over the covers"
6819,"out Caught by Raina!! All the muscle. But all the placement. Too bad it had to come off a full toss too. Yea, blame the timing, for batsman couldn't have picked out extra cover any better. He drives, doesn't bother keeping it down and who better than Raina to take these tracer bullets. batsman c Raina b bowler 23(15) [4s-2 6s-1]"
6820,"SIX, you beaut Yusuf. He's rocked forward, makes the decent back of a length ball into one in his slot and spanks it flat. My, o my, the power his bottom hand hides"
6821,"out Caught by (sub)Shorey!! There's the cutter, finally. Ngidi digs it into the pitch, taking pace off but Hooda's loaded himself up early, is into his heave well before the ball can get there. Nah, can't pull out either. Goes through, miscuing and popping into deep square leg. Well you can't blame Hooda, he had to go for everything. batsman c (sub)Shorey b bowler 3(4)"
6822,"SIX, length. Juicy, sitting up length. batsman plants his leg, hammering it 85-meters into long-off. So damn one-sided"
6823,"FOUR, brute Yusuf! Bravo has another poor cutter, only apt to end his spell with a muscle over the umpire. Nah, nothing Rayudu trying to cut it off can do"
6824,"SIX, talk about ruining something. Yes, this is just that. For some wierd reason, Ngidi goes for the yorker, Carlos shows us how the world remembered his name in the first place. By depositing it into long-on"
6825,"SIX, long-on's there. He's waiting. He reaches out .. and watches it fly fast. That's the hit. Thakur tries another one of his shorter balls, but batsman's not missing this. He's mowing them over"
6826,"out Caught by Rayudu!! Holes. Predictable lines from Thakur, short-outside off and predictable from batsman, swinging and aiming for the Western Railway trains outside. The pitch steals some timing, gets his toe-end and a running long-on cleans up. batsman c Rayudu b bowler 21(11) [6s-3]"
6827,"SIX, top-edge and six! First of the innings and this might get batsman going. bowler shortens his length and batsman is through the shot and hence the top-edge, went high and cleared the long leg fence with ease. Small boundaries at Wankhede"
6828,"FOUR, poor bowling from bowler. He tries the slower delivery when his natural deliveries were causing all sorts of problem, sits up as a half tracker and batsman dismisses it with a pull in front of square leg"
6829,"SIX, Gabbar unleashes! It is high time they start taking a risk or two. Length delivery right in the slot, batsman clears his front leg out of the way and launches it over the long-on fence. The swing has disappeared and the bowlers need to be clever now"
6830,"FOUR, wrong line from Karn. Lands it outside leg and batsman is quickly down on his knee to play the sweep, picked the googly and slotted it wide of the deep backward square. The fielder had no chance of stopping that"
6831,"FOUR, superb shot! It is not easy to hit Bravo's slower balls. But batsman does it superbly. Just delayed his shot and lofted the full off-cutter over extra cover. The placement was also perfect as he got it wide of sweeper cover"
6832,"SIX, excellent finish to the over. Three dots and still it is a 11-run over. Bravo goes searching for the yorker and bowls a juicy full toss, batsman moves across and helps it over short fine with a lap. A ball-boy takes a well judged catch outside the rope"
6833,"1 run, starts from over the wicket and lands it full, batsman works it to long-on and brings up the 50-run stand"
6834,"out Bowled!! Timbah! Turns back and points to someone in the crowd. Huge wicket for team. The timeout as it does so often brings a wicket along with it. Nothing but a dart from bowler, hard to get under it and sweep, batsman does just that, kneels down to play the sweep and is beaten by the length and pace, misses it altogether and the ball takes a deflection off the back thigh before crashing into the stumps. The partnership is broken and team have an opening. batsman b bowler 26(25) [4s-2 6s-1]"
6835,"FOUR, batsman is off the mark with a boundary. Watto tries his best to stop it at short third man, but just couldn't get across. Fraction short and around off, batsman manages to chop the cut behind square and Watson's dive is just an after thought. The sweeper also dives in vain near the boundary rope"
6836,"FOUR, MS won't be happy with this effort. It was touch fuller of good length and there was just enough room, batsman throws his bat at it and creams the drive to mid-off. Shardul Thakur there misfields and it goes for a boundary to long-off"
6837,out Caught by Dhoni!! Bangalore are falling apart here. Colin batsman always finds it difficult to bat against spin early in the innings and the difficulty goes up in these sorts of pitches. Ravindra bowler gave a bit of flight on this occasion and CdG was half-forward for a tentative push. Gets a faint outside edge and Dhoni makes no mistakes. batsman c Dhoni b bowler 4(6) [4s-1]
6838,"out Caught by Watson!! A big shout for lbw as batsman is struck on the pad. Not given. bowler persuades Dhoni to go for the review! Legal ball. It was the googly and batsman was pressing forward for the push. Is the impact outside off? Before that, was there an inside edge? Yes, confirmed by UltraEdge. The ball brushed the pad and carried to first slip. A review for lbw, given out caught! Got to give credit to bowler here. He forced MS to go upstairs and it's a successful one. batsman c Watson b bowler 2(3)"
6839,out Caught by Harbhajan!! Another one bites the dust. It was the googly from bowler and batsman dragged that from outside off with his sweep shot. No timing behind it and he holes out at deep mid-wicket. Harbhajan gobbles it up above his head and has his arms aloft. batsman c Harbhajan b bowler 4(12)
6840,"FOUR, nicely done! It wasn't too wide, batsman jumped back and slightly moved leg-side. And then, the lefty opened his bat-face to guide it fine of short third man"
6841,"no run, a flat in-turner and batsman missed the glance. Legal ball and no bat involved. HawkEye shows it to be going over leg. So, Chennai lose their review! The height was always a factor as it struck Parthiv on the front leg above the knee-roll"
6842,"out Bowled!! Nine down! This is a trademark bowler wicket. This one spins slightly, just enough to beat the outside edge and disturb the wood. A flat out-turner that pitched on middle and Umesh was playing for the angle. He had prodded forward to block, the ball though had other ideas. Hit the deck and turned away to bamboozle the batter. batsman b bowler 1(10)"
6843,out Caught by Kedar Jadhav!! bowler gets a wicket off his very first ball and out comes his little jig. An off-pace delivery at 101kph from a short of length. batsman was a touch early into his pull shot and ended up dragging it straight to Jaddu at backward square leg. batsman c Kedar Jadhav b bowler 29(35) [4s-2]
6844,"out Caught by Jadeja!! Oh dear! This is a huge moment in the match. Virat-the-run-machine-batsman has departed in single digits. It was a shorter delivery, batsman rocks back and takes out the pull shot. He hits it straight to the Jadeja at deep mid-wicket and Jaddu is safe as a house. He takes it with utmost ease. batsman c Jadeja b bowler 6(12)"
6845,"SIX, first maximum of the 2019 IPL! It was a fuller length delivery on the stumps, batsman goes down on his knees and nails the slog sweep over deep mid-wicket for a six"
6846,"out Caught&Bowled!! This is a soft soft dismissal. I am afraid to say, it is not the ideal track for the opening match of the IPL. bowler gives this one lots of air, it sticks in the wicket, comes slowly and bounces extra off the deck. batsman was on the back-foot, he wanted to work it to the on-side. He closes the face of the blade early, it hits his leading edge and pops up in the air. Bhajji takes a sitter of sitters. team in a spot of bother. batsman c and b bowler 9(8) [6s-1]"
6847,"2 runs, Tahir drops a sitter. ABD gets a lifeline. This can be dangerous for team. It was a fuller length delivery on the stumps, batsman moves to the off-side and slog sweeps it, it comes off the upper half of the bat and Tahir drops a rather easy catch at deep backward square leg"
6848,"out Caught by Jadeja!! bowler has his man. This is similar to OVAL 2017. Kohli was given a life there but he gifted a catch on the very next ball. Same has happened with ABD today. batsman attempts a slog sweep again, it stops in the wicket and batsman's timing was in a mess. This time the ball went squarer and Jadeja was the fielder at deep mid-wicket, he gets in a good position and takes a fine catch. team in serious trouble. batsman c Jadeja b bowler 9(10)"
6849,"out batsman Run Out!! batsman departs for a duck and team are in a total mess in the Lion's den. batsman taps it to the off-side and charges for a single, there was no response from Parthiv Patel and batsman was stranded in the middle. Raina at cover comes quickly and hurls the ball to MS who knocks off the bails. batsman was nowhere close to coming back. batsman run out (Raina/Dhoni) 0(2)"
6850,"out Caught by Watson!! Another bites the dust. And batsman is gutted with himself, absolutely gutted. He smashes the bat in air after he edged it. Oh these young players! It was a normal leggie wide of off, batsman plays a nothing shot. He wanted to steer it wide of slips, ends up playing too fine and hands a simple catch to Watson at slip. Half of the team is back in the hut now. batsman c Watson b bowler 2(5)"
6851,"FOUR, leggie on the stumps, batsman clears his leg and flicks it nonchalantly, he finds the gap wide of long-on and it thuds into the fence. Welcome boundary for batsman and team"
6852,"FOUR, MS won't be happy with this effort. It was touch fuller of good length and there was just enough room, batsman throws his bat at it and creams the drive to mid-off. Shardul Thakur there misfields and it goes for a boundary to long-off"

6868,"SIX, lovely, a little shimmy down the track, Lynn gets close to the ball and then lifts it nonchalantly over long-on - a towering hit and he's off and running"
6869,"SIX, flat drag down -- just what batsman needs to break his shackles. Camps behind, swings, flat and deposits it deep into square leg"
6870,"SIX, oh there's a plan. There's surely a plan, and bowler is the villan in that plan. Rana's quick to sink down, pick the sitting-up length, get under it and smoke it into cow corner"
6871,"out Bowled!! Off-cartwheel. It's a well-documented strategy -- soften up a batsman with a bumper, and then nail the yorker. Kaul's read that book, and he goes quick, full, on the base of off. batsman clearly hasn't, running down the pitch, making room as well to make matters worse and then is too slow in jamming his attempted-driving-bat down. batsman b bowler 35(27) [4s-3 6s-1]"
6872,"FOUR, too easy. Full pitch up, Rana's down quickly as well, sweeping him with utter disdain into an behind square region. Zero respect"
6873,"out Caught by Bhuvneshwar!! Perfectly disguised slower one, and nobody's dropping them now. Sandeep has his moral victory, correcting a horrible start and messing around with batsman's head, who was waiting for it to get quicker. But it sticks in the pitch, with DK committing to his drive, and eventually trying to pull out. The result - a one-handed nothing chip, easy to extra cover close-in. batsman c Bhuvneshwar b bowler 2(4)"
6874,"1 run, 126.9kph, solid crunchy front-footed drive, through point. Also, quite neat to get to his fifty -- his sixth IPL one"
6875,"no run, Hyderabad review: Not an obvious googly - yup, it's the leggie, but the obvious missed slog-sweep. And Rana's struck on his back thigh pad in front of leg. Many questions here - where's it pitching? Where's it heading? Again, like it was in the first innings, it's taking ages to load the replays for the third umpire. Poor internet speed somewhere in Kolkata, check the fiber cables .. anyway, the front foot is cleared out. Oh and the impact is just down leg"
6876,"FOUR, just too short. Also the googly going away from him helps, which Rana's quick to pounce on with a fierce cut. And there's no one at point"
6877,"SIX, juicy. A full toss around the waist, full-paced as well and Rana stays in the arc, in the V and slices it high, 79-meters into long-off"
6878,"FOUR, premeditates the reverse, and knows third man is inside to sweep it neatly over him, perfectly"
6879,"out Lbw!! Thank the lights Rashid, it's successfully broken Rana's momentum. A slower leg-break by his standards and Rana tries to carefully nurdle it away after plonking his front leg in front of middle. But no, loses his timing, misses all ends up and the umpire is convinced enough. Rana's convinced to walk off as well, but the ball's striking him in front of leg, could it have spun down? batsman lbw b bowler 68(47) [4s-8 6s-3]"
6880,"FOUR, picks. Dispatches. Spots it outside off and carves it away, no clobbers it away over extra cover. Almost all the way too .."
6881,"SIX, ah, the dreadful length. Kaul asking for trouble here, and Russell - the compulsive punisher that he is - obliger. Clears out that front leg of his, gets it in his swinging zone and smacks it way over deep mid-wicket"
6882,"SIX, misses the yorker now. Russell gets lesses than half his bat on this, but his biceps will do .. makes room, tonks it straight back, and it's good enough for 77 meters"
6883,"FOUR, more carnage. Russell's turning the tables, and turning them with muscle. Kaul dishes out another short sit-up outside off, for Russell to move away to, free up his arms and slap it away powerfully through extra cover"
6884,"FOUR, well, well, well. bowler's got this one to reverse, tailing in sharply on the pads. But Russell's rocked behind in his crease, with all his bottom-hand coming in this whip through mid-wicket"
6885,"SIX, oh he's nearly troubling the electricity board himself, sending this soaring so high and long that to try and clean up the light tower they just repaired. Okay so it's full on leg, and Russell continues clearing his front leg and sending it into the skies over cow corner"
6886,"FOUR, it's a joke. It really is. It's a yorker, no less, but Russell's adept at squeezing it away from leg-stump with a drill into long-off"
6887,"SIX, he's fooled here, but such has been the audacity of this hitting that Russell sends this into the stands as well. Nearly falls over as he tries clubbing one from outside off, but it's his day, and it's well over long-off"
6888,"SIX, well he's been waiting, and he reminds us that he can tonk them around too for fun. Dances, swings, deep, long, game, set, match"
6889,"SIX, ho, ho. Another dance down, cleaner to the pitch of it and smokes it into the sightscreen that's taken many a blow tonight. It's a steal, an under-broken-lights robbery. Hyderabad, call the cops!"
6890,"out Caught by Rashid Khan!! That looked ugly, but bowler has his man. A pre-empted charge from Lynn, bowler saw it coming and fired the slider - kept coming with the angle and cramped Lynn for room - he looked very awkward as he tried to force it away - off the toe-end of the bat and scooped in the air towards cover-point. Rashid under the ball and he doesn't drop those. batsman c Rashid Khan b bowler 7(11) [6s-1]"
6891,"FOUR, clumsy from Rashid and he looks to be in some trouble - short of a length and well outside off, Rana gets on top of the bounce and cracked it straight to cover-point - Rashid jammed his fingers at the ball and let it slip through. 'It's paining', he says cheekily later"
6892,"FOUR, nicely done, short of a length and at the stumps, batsman gets inside the line and tucks it fine - backward square leg was inside the ring and has no chance"
6893,"FOUR, lovely, fuller length delivery and at the stumps, Rana leans forward, head on top of the ball and then lets his wrists take over - drives it sumptuously wide of mid-wicket for a boundary"
6894,"SIX, beautifully played, tad too full from Sandeep, Rana leans forward, drives it on the up and clears mid-on with ease - the timing is so sweet that the ball lands on the ropes and it's a maximum"
6895,"FOUR, edged and four, the slower off-cutter from Sandeep, did Rana in for pace - was early into the drive and the thick edge runs past the keeper for a boundary"
6896,"FOUR, handy runs for batsman, backed away to a full ball and drove with a closed face - Kaul couldn't stop the ball on his followthrough and although it wasn't sweetly struck - managed to beat the diving mid-off fielder"
6897,"FOUR, jumps down, a little too close for comfort eventually, but then has quick hard hands and good enough power in squeezing out this eventual yorker through sweeper. Yup, the powerplay does help .."
6898,"1 run, a sitter .. and dropped. Yusuf Pathan of all people. batsman's done in in his desperate attempt to make room and hoick one downtown. Has absolutely no control, and Pathan has all the time in the world to settle under at long-on, wait, and then let the ball slip through"
6899,"FOUR, another ugly across-the-line swipe. And Uthappa's luck rubs into Rana, who goes hard, gets a thick top-edge, flying over slip"
6900,"FOUR, fine leg's inside, and if that's not a legality to go extravagant, nothing is! Rana reads the slower one, shuffles, sits on a knee and sweeps, well past 45"
6901,"FOUR, first boundary for team and batsman! Another googly by bowler, the southpaw rocks back and places it right through the gap at covers with a firm backfoot punch"
6902,"FOUR, second boundary of the over! Not a great start by bowler. Darts this one around off and batsman thumps it through the gap at covers once again. The outfield is lightning quick"
6903,"no run, team review: They have decided to challenge the umpire's call against batsman. But for me, it's clearly pitching outside leg. Was the googly that beat the batsman's flick and struck him on the pads. Might have crashed into the stumps but if it's pitching outside leg, it makes no sense. Awful review by team. Not out is the final verdict"
6904,"SIX, batsman is in top gear! Tad short around off, the southpaw reaches out for it and thumps it right over long-on. Six more and Sunrisers have moved on to 92 after the first 10 overs, batsman has scored 62 of them"
6905,"FOUR, cracking shot, dropped short and wide of off, batsman makes room and clatters it behind square on the off-side for a boundary"
6906,"1 run, chance and Gill has dropped it, would have been a fine catch - he did well to get to the ball, had to go one handed, parried it in the air and then couldn't get across on the rebound - would have been a screamer had he held on. Coming to the ball, batsman backed away to a well flighted delivery and drilled it inside out - wide of cover"
6907,"1 run, slower and just outside off, driven down towards long-off for a single, raises team's 100"
6908,"FOUR, streaky and four, short of a length and at the stumps, batsman was backing away on the pull, gets a thick inside edge that flies over the top of leg-stump"
6909,"FOUR, lovely, the wrong 'un from Piyush, but the length is well short, batsman makes room and clatters it over cover for a boundary"
6910,"out Bowled!! This was coming, batsman was getting edgy with every dot delivery - this was the wrong 'un, slower and spinning back into the right-hander, think batsman picked it as he rocked back on the pull - beaten by the lack of pace, went through with the shot a fraction too early and ended up losing his off-stump. But he has played his role, not a bad first knock at the IPL. batsman b bowler 39(35) [4s-3 6s-1]"
6911,"SIX, massive, I reckon team got the better trade - after they let Dhawan go, picked the wrong 'un, went down low and swipes it it high and over square leg for a maximum"
6912,"SIX, clubbed, that's sheer power from batsman, back of a length and at the stumps, was the slower ball from Russell - batsman waits on it and then punches it back over the bowler's head - the timing is sweet and the ball sails over the ropes for a maximum"
6913,"out Caught by Uthappa!! That's a smart catch from Uthappa and didn't team need this - batsman will be kicking himself though, a wide half-volley and he creamed it sweetly - the timing was sweet, but batsman didn't hit the gap - was travelling to his left, but Uthappa slid across, got both hands to it and holds on. Can this make a difference of 15-20 runs? batsman c Uthappa b bowler 85(53) [4s-9 6s-3]"
6914,"out Bowled!! Cleaned up! A nothing shot from Yusuf and team are coming back strongly into the contest. Change of pace and Yusuf was done in like a kipper. The slower off-cutter, rolled his fingers across the seam, Yusuf went nowhere on the swing, feet rooted to the crease as he swung across in hope - missed it completly, the ball clipped the back-pad before smashing into the middle-stump. batsman b bowler 1(4)"
6915,"FOUR, cracking shot, the slower ball and Manish spotted it, backed away and slapped it in the gap wide of cover, no chance for the men in the ring and Manish collects his first boundary"
6916,"SIX, cracking shot, the slower ball from bowler, but the ball simply sat up to be smacked, batsman made room and clears long-on by a distance - simply stunning from batsman"
6917,"no run, batsman has been given OUT LBW and he wants a review. Was the ball tailing enough to miss the leg-stump? It's a fair delivery, think there's no bat on that and I feel it's sliding down - the impact seems to be in front of leg. UltraEdge confirms that there's no bat on that. Hawk-Eye in: Missing and batsman survives. Low full-toss and the late tail beat batsman's attempted whip, struck him low and was going down with the angle"
6918,"FOUR, handy runs for batsman, on a length and tailing back into the right-hander, he waited on it and then clipped it backward of square on the on-side - right in the gap between the two fielders in the ring and it runs away to the ropes"
6919,"FOUR, much-needed boundary for batsman, spotted the slower ball and then delayed the pull, gets it wide of mid-wicket and runs away to the ropes"
6920,"FOUR, stand and deliver! No need to move, anyone. Stay put. Short in length around off, batsman rocks back and pulls it over mid-wicket. No fielders in the deep and that shall be four runs to end the over"
6921,"no run, team review: batsman has been adjudged lbw and he's decided to challenge the umpire's call. Is there an inside edge? There certainly is a sound. Yup, there's a spike on the UltraEdge and Jonny survives. Was the googly that beat the batsman's flick and struck him on the pads"
6922,"SIX, thumped down the ground! batsman shimmies down the wicket, converts it into a half volley and lofts it right over the bowler's head. Couldn't have hit a better shot"
6923,"FOUR, boundary to end the over! That'll spoil his first over. Bowls a low full toss outside off and batsman carves it through the gap at covers. The outfield does the rest"
6924,"FOUR, fine start for team as the 50 comes up! A long hop down the leg side and batsman drags it past the fielder at short fine leg. Struggling with his lines is bowler"
6925,"FOUR, another loosener down the leg side and it's been hacked through square leg by batsman. Clears the infield convincingly for four more"
6926,"FOUR, class! Returning to the IPL after a couple of years but it seems he never left. Premeditates and puts this one away to the third man fence with a fine reverse sweep"
6927,"FOUR, played! Finesse in that shot. Goes down on his knee and scoops the floater right past the keeper. No fine leg in place and that shall be four runs for YJB"
6928,"FOUR, impeccable power on that! Width on offer and batsman slams it past the fielder at covers. Just a boundary away from a lightning quick fifty, is batsman. Narine is walking off the field as he got hit on his nails while trying to stop this bullet that was fired at him"
6929,"SIX, fifty on comeback for batsman! His 37th fifty in the history of IPL. Gets there in grand style with a six. Latches on to the short ball and slices it over third man. The fielder was sprinting across but he could do nothing more than watching this sail over him"
6930,"FOUR, hammered! Fractionally short and that's enough for Shaw to take it on, Goes on the front foot to launch the pull over mid-on. Gets it well wide and also comfortably over the fielder"
6931,"out Caught by de Kock!! Edged and gone! bowler provides the early breakthrough for team. How often has he done this? The away angler that's full and moves away just a bit, Shaw is stuck on the crease as he opts for that flamboyant drive of his. Looks good when it comes off but not here, as he only gets an edge that's taken sharply by de Kock moving to his right. batsman c de Kock b bowler 7(6) [4s-1]"
6932,"FOUR, he was saving the power for this shot. It was full and was wide of off, batsman smkoes it straight down the ground and it rockets to fence"
6933,"FOUR, this one was much slower from bowler, he was guilty of providing width again. batsman delays his bat swing and powers it wide of backward point for a boundary"
6934,"FOUR, bowling against left-handers for a left-arm spinner is never an easy prospect and bowler is finding it really tough at the moment. It was on the shorter side and there was width, batsman uses the width to good effect and punches it wide of cover for another four. He is looking in fabulous touch"
6935,"FOUR, batsman is finally getting a move on. He must have faced million balls of bowler in the nets and that experience comes to his advantage. He comes on the front foot and drives it wide of mid-off, it races along the carpet for a boundary"
6936,"FOUR, shot man! He is finding the gaps to perfection, moves across to the off-side and plays a cheeky little paddle over short fine for a boundary"
6937,"FOUR, that is immaculate placement from batsman. He waits for the ball to arrive, opens the face of the bat at the last moment and guides it in between short third and backward point for a boundary"
6938,"out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! batsman fails to get a fifty in his comeback match in the IPL. There was pressure on him after getting such a heavy paycheck from team this year in the auction. And he has certainly lived upto the expectations. It was a slower delivery wide of off, batsman goes back and wanted to pump it over deep mid-wicket. He fails to time it as well as he would have liked and ends up gifting at catch to the younger Pandya at deep mid-wicket. batsman c Hardik Pandya b bowler 47(32) [4s-7 6s-1]"
6939,"FOUR, that is batsman-madness for you! It was a good length delivery on the stumps, batsman moves to the off-side and half-paddle-half-flicks it over short fine. He gets enough bat on it and it lands centimeters short of the boundary ropes"
6940,"FOUR, batsman gets lucky. It was a short of length delivery on the body, he was taken aback by how sharply it lifted off the deck and was too early on the pull shot. Gets it off the glove and just clears the keeper for a boundary"
6941,"SIX, he is upping the ante now. It was a nothing delivery, banged in around hip-height. batsman gets in a good position and powers the pull shot over deep mid-wicket for a maximum"
6942,"out Caught by Suryakumar Yadav!! batsman's fighting innings comes to an end. Not the most ravishing knock but may be he was given the role of anchoring the innings. It was a slower delivery wide of off, batsman wanted to clear deep mid-wicket, mishits it and Suryakumar takes a dolly at deep mid-wicket. batsman c Suryakumar Yadav b bowler 43(36) [4s-4 6s-1]"
6943,"SIX, this wild heave from batsman is becoming a trademark shot for him. It was short and wide of off, batsman clears his front leg and hoicks it over deep mid-wicket for a maximum"
6944,"FOUR, just to tell people that he can hit it over the off-side too. It was a slower one wide of off, batsman delays his bat swing just a little bit and powers it wide of long-off for a boundary"
6945,"SIX, this is batsman at his very best. He has taken bowler apart. Stays put in the crease and slams the pull shot over deep mid-wicket. Lot of wrist work in that shot"
6946,"FOUR, it takes some talent to hit that high full-toss for a boundary. And batsman indeed has that. Not the most elegantly but it surely was effective. It was a full-toss on the stumps, batsman stays in the crease and pumps it wide of long-off for a boundary"
6947,"out Caught by de Kock!! Paul's debut wasn't that fruiful. And bowler has his third. He is a wicket-machine for the Mumbai Indians in the IPL. It was banged in half way down the track and was going across the right-hander, it climbs onto batsman who attempts a pull shot. Only manages to top-edge it and it goes back to QDK who takes it with utmost ease. batsman c de Kock b bowler 3(5)"
6948,"FOUR, another boundary for batsman. In no time, he has moved to 41. It was short and was on the body, batsman somehow manages to pull it fine of fine-leg for a boundary. It looked extremely clumsy but got four runs for it"
6949,"FOUR, batsman joins the party too. First off his firts ball. There was width on this delivery and batsman cuts it over backward point and wide of third man for a boundary"
6950,"out Caught by Rasikh Salam!! In the air and taken. bowler strikes back! It was banged in on a short of length, was on the face of batsman. He attempts a cheeky upper cut and finds third man where the 17-year-old Salam takes it easily. batsman c Rasikh Salam b bowler 4(2) [4s-1]"
6951,"SIX, wow! batsman is on a roll here. Not many batsmen in the world can dispatch bowler for a six when he nails the yorker but batsman can! It was very full and was on the stumps, batsman goes deep in the crease and unleashes the half-helicoper shot over deep square leg for a maximum. Shot of the evening!"
6952,"FOUR, fifty for batsman. One of the better T20 knocks you would see. It was a back of a length delivery on the body, batsman gets behind it and half-pulls it wide of deep mid-wicket for a boundary"
6953,"SIX, clears the fence with ease. How easy he makes it look. It was a length delivery on the stumps, batsman clears his front leg and dispatches it over deep square leg for another six"
6954,"SIX, going, going and gone! That's hugeeeeeeee! And tell you what, he has only used one hand. This is unbelievable power-hitting from batsman. It was a slower delivery wide of off, batsman takes it from wide of off, brings his bat down at an incredible speed and launches it over long-on for a six"
6955,"FOUR, no need to run for that. It was a full-toss wide of off and batsman in this form is not going to let it go. He reaches for it and tonks it wide of long-on, it rockets to the fence"
6956,"SIX, batsman has gone nuts at the Wankhede. bowler is been taken to the cleaners here from the southpaw. It was a fuller length delivery on the stumps, batsman goes back and pumps it over deep square leg for another maximum"
6957,"SIX, oh dear! batsman is at it too. They are all at it. Tewatia goes down on his knees and slog sweeps India's fastest bowler for a maximum over deep mid-wicket"
6958,"FOUR, up and over! Overcooked from Salam and Iyer goes aerial. Front foot loft, comfortably over extra cover and it races away"
6959,"FOUR, stylish shot! Not that bad a ball, almost the perfect yorker but Iyer was making room and with third man in the ring, it was only about beating that fielder. The team captain does so by opening the bat face ever so late to find the gap. Timed sweetly as well"
6960,"SIX, how well has he hit this! Full and in the slot, he just extends the forward defence into a chip shot and such is the connection that it not only clears mid-off but also the ropes on the full"
6961,"out Caught by Pollard!! bowler has his revenge! Must say that Pollard owns the credits for this wicket, a sharp catch diving to his right. Iyer will be disappointed, looked really good while he was there and this wasn't a wicket-taking ball either. Was pitched up for the drive and he couldn't keep the shot down. Was travelling towards the extra cover region where KP plucks it out. team have been dented early. batsman c Pollard b bowler 16(10) [4s-2 6s-1]"
6962,"FOUR, superb shot! Full and wide, batsman stays in his crease and drives this on the up square through the off-side. Timing was the standout factor as he threaded the stacked field set, through backward point and races away"
6963,"FOUR, first real confident stroke that batsman has played tonight! Width on offer and he loves that. Stand and deliver on the slap-drive that pierces the gap at cover and blazes away to the fence"
6964,"FOUR, just over a diving Pollard at backward point! Was shortish and a hint of room which batsman pounced on with a flashing cut. Clears the infield, just, to get the boundary"
6965,"SIX, smokedddddddd! Can't bowl short to batsman, he'll have you for breakfast and dinner all day long. Clears his front leg and clobbers the pull over deep mid-wicket. Made a cracking sound off the blade"
6966,"FOUR, great effort in the deep but can only palm it away to the deep mid-wicket fence. Was a loose half tracker on leg stump, batsman swivelled and pulled it flat. On the bounce past the diving fielder near the rope"
6967,"FOUR, not off the middle at all but batsman will take it. Has been struggling to force the pace tonight. Shortish and wide, throws his hands on the cut and toe-ends it. Well wide of de Kock and very fine to the third man fence"
6968,"SIX, the release over that batsman was searching for! Short and wide, batsman loves the ramp and the geographical details of the Wankhede allow him to as well. The ball really travels here and the ball clears the third man fence quite easily"
6969,"FOUR, edged and four, fuller length delivery outside off, drew batsman into the drive - went with hard hands and the edge flew through the empty slip cordon for a boundary"
6970,"FOUR, poor bowling by bowler! Bowls this one on the pads and batsman sweeps it through fine leg, ends the over with 10 runs of two deliveries"
6971,"FOUR, this is a vintage batsman shot! Rolled back the clock with this stroke. Overpitched from Paul and it's a nonchalant jab down the ground. Crisp, clean and sails over mid-off. Wow!"
6972,"1 run, shortish and outside off, batsman delays the dab to get it down to third man"
6973,"out Caught by Rahul Tewatia!! Excellent thinking from Paul! Goes for the knuckle ball, brave option against the big hitting batsman who is clearly foxed by the variation. He was making room for a lofted stroke but had to adjust. Too late and the result is a chip that goes all the way to sweeper cover. Tewatia didn't have to budge. batsman c Rahul Tewatia b bowler 21(13) [4s-2 6s-1]"
6974,"out Caught&Bowled!! What a soft dismissal! Hardik is generally good against spin, not this time. Quickish slider and he pats it back down the track. Couldn't keep it down and a dolly of a return catch for bowler who accepts it like a craving kid who gets a candy. Falling apart now, the Mumbai Indians. batsman c and b bowler 0(2)"
6975,"FOUR, shot! Very full and outside off, Krunal drills the drive straight back past the bowler. Power and precision, tick!"
6976,"SIX, outrageous hit from Krunal! Pacy short of a length ball and he was hanging back, smokes the flat-batted hit high and handsome over the long-on fence. Shot!"
6977,"FOUR, low full toss and width on offer, Krunal won't miss out as he blasts this through the covers. Belted it away with disdain"
6978,"FOUR, this is rubbish bowling! With third man up, the only thing you shouldn't do is provide width. bowler does just that and it's a full toss too to compound the miseries for team. Krunal throws his bat at it and gets a slice that beats the fielder to the fence"
6979,"FOUR, Krunal is on the charge! Creating some momentum for team but he has to bat deep. This is a yorker attempt gone wrong from bowler, a full toss and it's whipped away through the big gap at square leg"
6980,"FOUR, Yuvraj must be wondering what's going on. He's getting yorkers at his end while Krunal gets full tosses. Here is another and it's blasted straight over the bowler's head. Like a rocket to the fence it goes. He's keeping team alive"
6981,"out Caught by Rahul Tewatia!! The fun is over. bowler cleverly took pace off after a barrage of pacy deliveries. Krunal had to slog at everything, given the match situation and he hasn't connected this well at all. Mistimed and finds deep mid-wicket to perfection. Tewatia has been a busy man tonight near the fence. Is that the game? batsman c Rahul Tewatia b bowler 32(15) [4s-5 6s-1]"
6982,"SIX, batsman's got hold of this one! Flatter and outside off, he had to fetch this and did so. Chose the safest spot on the ground - straight back down the ground, crashing into the sight screen. Can the old warhorse create a fist of this chase?"
6983,"SIX, smashed away! Half tracker and batsman is sitting back for precisely this length. Pulls it merrily into the crowd at deep mid-wicket"
6984,"out Caught by Pant!! Another one bites the dust and team's already declining hopes are further dented. Pacy and full from bowler, batsman is quite late on the drive and there is a noise as this goes through to Pant. The appeal for caught behind is approved and batsman goes for a review. Almost a forced one, considering the situation. It did seem like bat hitting ground and replays show that but, there's also a spike on UltraEdge as ball passes the bat. batsman c Pant b bowler 3(4)"
6985,"FOUR, handy runs. batsman it is this time. Premeditated the paddle scoop and got the length too, a full toss. Watched it onto the bat closely to guide it away fine down the leg-side to the fence"
6986,"FOUR, streaky runs but it brings up batsman's fifty! Not a bad team debut for the veteran who has had his moments of luck too. Like this one. Slogged at it and got a thick edge that beat short third man to the fence"
6987,"FOUR, muscled over extra cover! Full and in the slot, batsman backs away and lifts it powerfully. No protection in the deep"
6988,"out Caught by Rahul Tewatia!! Fourth catch for Tewatia. He's having a field day in the deep. batsman's show is over, wasn't at his best really, rode his luck quite a bit but the important part was that he stuck in. Nobody else did barring Krunal and to an extent Pollard. This was a slog without any timing. Picked out deep mid-wicket with precision. batsman c Rahul Tewatia b bowler 53(35) [4s-5 6s-3]"
6989,out Stumped!! Razor sharp work from Pant! Was a googly from Tewatia and batsman went across the line for a big hit. Missed it and the team keeper was lightning quick to dislodge the bails. batsman st Pant b bowler 10(8) [4s-2]
6990,"FOUR, that's what he can do! Right into the slot around middle and leg, hint of tail into the batsman and it's been whiplashed past the man at mid-on by QdK"
6991,"SIX, batsman has arrived and how! Latches on to this length delivery, holds his shape and whacks it over deep mid-wicket for half-a-dozen"
6992,"FOUR, no stoppin him now! bowler presents a juicy freebie on the pads, a full toss and it's been helped past the man at short fine leg by the pocket sized dynamite. Has been a day of left handers. Warner earlier in the day, Pant in the previous innings and batsman now"
6993,"FOUR, why should QdK have all the fun? The Mumbai skipper joins in the party now. Waits for the slower delivery deep back in his crease and flicks it over short fine leg. Two fielders converge but none can stop it from reaching the fence"
6994,out Caught by Rahul Tewatia!! bowler strikes! For a moment Tewatia had misjudged this in the deep but does really well to keep his eyes on the ball and take it just when it's about to dip in front of him. batsman was down on his knee as he picked up the length delivery towards the deep square leg fence. Got the elevation but not the distance he was looking for. batsman c Rahul Tewatia b bowler 14(13) [4s-2]
6995,out batsman Run Out!! Iyer nails a direct-hit and it's curtains for batsman! Challenges the opposition skipper's arm and has to pay the price for it. Played this one towards mid-off and called for a single but he was never going to make it. Not the kind of start Mumbai Indians were looking for. batsman run out (Shreyas Iyer) 2(6)
6996,"FOUR, batsman is keeping Mumbai alive in this chase. He's dealing in boundaries and absorbing all the pressure. A short delivery around middle and leg, batsman swivels and puts it away to the fine leg fence, the fielder was too square to cut this down"
6997,"FOUR, fetch that! A length delivery around middle and leg, the left hander stays put and whacks it over mid-wicket. Making the most of the powerplay by playing these aerial shots"
6998,"out Caught by Boult!! Mumbai sink further as bowler bags his second wicket. Was a short ball that was pulled nicely by batsman but it flew quickly to the man at fine leg. Boult is the man stationed in the deep who plucks it out of thin air. He's taken blinders on numerous occasions previously. Compared to those, this was just a regulation catch for the Kiwi speedster. batsman c Boult b bowler 27(16) [4s-4 6s-1]"
6999,"FOUR, smaaashed! Overpitched delivery around off, batsman stands tall and thumps it over the bowler's head. That went quicker than a bullet to the fence"
7000,"SIX, clean as a whistle! Can batsman do a Russell? Keeps his eyes on the ball and smokes the tossed up delivery right over the bowler's head. High, handsome and it's six runs for Mumbai Indians. Yuvi needs to hit a few of these if the hosts want to make a match out of it"
7001,"FOUR, batsman finally connects one! Tad short outside off, pounces on the width on offer and chops it past the fielder at third man. His best timed shot of this innings so far"
7002,"FOUR, Shikhar Dhawan makes a mess. There wasn't even a single there, but the batsman will get a boundary instead. Yuvi had swept the flatter delivery towards short fine leg where Shikhar misfields and lets it past him"
7003,"FOUR, that's nicely played! Was on the pads and batsman clips it past the fielder at backward square leg. With the dew setting in, the lightning quick outfield beats the fielder's chase and takes it away to the fence"
7004,"SIX, shot! This is what the crowd has come for! Tad short outside off and batsman lofts it over covers for an excellent six. All about timing was that shot"
7005,"FOUR, oh that's elegance personified! Nowhere near a half-volley length, a length delivery outside off, tempted into the drive, and thankfully it doesn't seam, driven on the up off the sticker to the sweeper cover boundary for four"
7006,"out Caught by Buttler! Oh oh oh! That's the batsman who's taken guard with the scars of the SENA year sinking deeper into his conscience. A back of a length delivery jagging away slightly, swerving a little as well, and batsman is on the backfoot, with a perfect set-up to punch it towards the covers, but tries to withdraw at the final moment, only to end up getting a thick outside edge to the right of the 'keeper who dives full-stretch to his right to grab a fantastic catch! That's the end of KL for the night, then. batsman c Buttler b bowler 4(4) [4s-1]"
7007,"SIX, a hint of flight on offer outside off, batsman reaches out and swings his bat through the line, runs his hands through it in lofting it over long-off for six!"
7008,"FOUR, yup, he can't resist his funk any longer. Arches behind, sticks out an upper cut and Rahane's attempted funky-ness of keeping a deep first slip doesn't make much of a difference - with this going to third man usually is"
7009,"FOUR, nearly the season's screamer .. Samson covers good ground, flies, but no, he's not as genetically blessed as a Holder. So it was short, with no pace as usual and batsman's adjusted heave just can't be kept down. Luckily for him, it's a foot wide of deep mid-wicket"
7010,"FOUR, pick. Heave. Dispatch. Very agricultural without a lot of feet, using the slow sitter to just swing across the line and smoke it into long-on"
7011,"FOUR, if being short was bad, this one's wide outside off as well. And for batsman, it's a toy around. He walks back in the crease, waits for it to get close and times his cut perfectly backward of point"
7012,"FOUR, sheer exhibition on how you time your muscle. bowler tries cramping up the room and batsman wrists a short arm pull, through mid-wicket"
7013,"SIX, some more. And more = clean. It's pitched up, but still enough in the slot for batsman to go further inside to and tonk it neatly into the sightscreen. Also, a personal 50 -- and nothing WWE-like in the celebrations .. aah, someone's grown up"
7014,"FOUR, half a step, but full hands. Gets the back leg out, whippy wrists and drills it away through the covers"
7015,"FOUR, the 180-degree opposite now. Drags the line from outside off, perfectly under the sweep to nail it through square leg"
7016,"SIX, whoa. Absolute carnage. Once that knee bends, things don't stay in this circumference. Archer dishes out full pace but batsman's swing is mightier. Smashes the sightscreen"
7017,"FOUR, stays conventional, and reaps. Kulkarni, with the scars of the earlier ball still playing in his head, keeps it short, and Sarfaraz stays up tall to it and whacks it away square into mid-wicket"
7018,"SIX, 134.2kph. Plus a pitch up in the arc. So batsman swings with a straight bat, with a lot of toe-end, but those muscles will do an 87-meters themselves"
7019,"byes, FOUR, oh, bowler will have to make his peace will only a moral victory. Nails the yorker, and it's quickly ripping through batsman's legs. Too good for Buttler behind as well .."
7020,"FOUR, and he's back to dishing out length. batsman lets it get parallel, slices his cut violently, powerfully, one-bounced behind point"
7021,"FOUR, it's reached that stage where it just doesn't matter what you bowl. So this is on a back of a length, batsman goes up tall to it and with a very straight bat-flow, tonks it over the bowler's head. Outrageous"
7022,"out Caught by R Tripathi!! It needed a blinder, it gets a blinder. Tripathi's ruined the fun with his brilliance. It was another flashy pull, just as crunchy-sounding and just as clean-looking. And make no mistake, there's plenty of legs on this. But, but, it's all too flat. And Tripathi, waiting at the deep mid-wicket boundary leaps up, judges it as perfectly as it could get. Nevertheless, batsman's put on a proper show, and he's helped himself to his highest ever score against the Royals. batsman c R Tripathi b bowler 79(47) [4s-8 6s-4]"
7023,"FOUR, batsman connects and finds the gap at deep extra cover. Another full and widish delivery from bowler outside off, batsman throws his bat and crunches it in the gap to collect a boundary"
7024,"FOUR, carved over point! Very full and wide of off, the slower delivery from bowler. Sarfaraz gets low and flashes it with all his might. Third man fielder was straighter and had no chance"
7025,"out Caught by Rahane!! batsman picks out Rahane at long-off. Trimmed the pace and kept it wider of off, batsman went hard at it and ended up mistiming it to Royals' captain. batsman scratchy knock comes to an end. It came off the toe-end, hence lacked the timing. Also, lack of pace meant that he had to generate some power but the southpaw failed on that occasion. batsman c Rahane b bowler 12(14) [4s-1]"
7026,"FOUR, unorthodoxy from Sarfaraz. Brings out his patented ramp, getting low in time and elevating it over the short third man fielder. bowler has a cheeky smile on his face"
7027,"FOUR, not sure caressed is a word you use for a batsman shot. He's the brute-force player. A good length delivery angling across, and he just lays into it, transfers his weight and splits the gap in the cover region to time is beautifully to the sweeper cover fence for four"
7028,"SIX, going, going and gone! What a finish to the innings. It was full and in the slot, Sarfaraz clears his front leg and whacks it across the line. Enough power and it sails over cow corner"
7029,"FOUR, a grunt on that by bowler, but it is no good! Good length but loads of width on offer, batsman throws his hands at it and laces it to the sweeper cover boundary for four"
7030,"FOUR, not the best of starts for bowler, nothing wrong with that back of a length delivery in the zone, and that's just a lazy late-cut to the vacant fine third man boundary for four"
7031,"SIX, 133.3km/h, normal pace, on a back of a length, batsman backs away and transfers his weight onto that through-the-line loft over deep extra cover for six! Fantastic hit!"
7032,"SIX, okay, his eye is in officially. Also bowler's tossing this in the slot, when batsman's already waiting on a knee. And bang. Over cow corner. Maybe it's still travelling .."
7033,"out Caught by D Kulkarni!! Yea, you can't let your state-mate have a moral internal laugh, even if it's only for a ball, can you? Well, batsman surely can't let him do. He clears out his front leg, looks to go lofted over mid-off, but in his desperation gets a little too much wood under the ball. Hence - great elevation, but distance = a damn alert long-off. Kulkarni, judges it perfectly, going right to the edge of the rope, and then balances himself superbly as well to ensure his over-head attempt doesn't take him over. batsman c D Kulkarni b bowler 22(24) [4s-1 6s-2]"
7034,"FOUR, batsman is off and running. Curran pitches it up just outside off, batsman with all his bottom-hand power slaps it fiercely past mid-off. Brute force from the skip!"
7035,"FOUR, ""That is a stroke of a touch player,"" exclaims Ian Bishop on air. batsman is a smart customer when it comes to manipulating the field in the PowerPlays. This was floaty away-angler from Curran outside off, batsman gets his weight forward and chips it over the in-field on the off-side. Bounces in front of the ropes and batsman earns his second boundary of the over"
7036,"FOUR, woah! Back-to-back fours. Wonderful start for the Royals. This was all timing from batsman. Very full and just outside off, batsman leans forward and checks his drive, flawless timing and it beats mid-off"
7037,"FOUR, it's raining boundaries. Appalling start from Rahman, drifts it down leg and it's easy pickings for batsman. Gets some wood on it and tucks it to the right of short fine leg"
7038,"FOUR, first boundary for Steve batsman this IPL. He will be a relieved man. Gets across and hammers the length ball over mid-wicket with sheer power"
7039,"SIX, that's Steven batsman at his very best! Ah, those whippy wrists - International cricket missed you! Shuffles a tad, like he always does, and absolutely smokes it into the second tier"
7040,"SIX, that's the best he's hit thus far! Stands still inside the crease, watches the full ball dip outside off and creams the loft with high hands, flat for a 82-metre maximum over wide long-off"
7041,"1 run, full and sliding on leg-stump, batsman missed the flick and got a tiny bit of under-edge onto the pad. Ashwin went up for the review after a chat with his bowler, but to no avail"
7042,"out Caught by Rahul!! That's the catch of this season so far. KL Rahul is absolutely pumped, he thumps his chest and lets out a few emotions. Well, it's been a game full of emotions thus far. This was full and angling away from batsman outside off, he went for the lofted hit over extra cover but ended up skewing it off the cue end. KL Rahul from long-off covered a lot of miles to his left and never lost the sight of the ball, dived full length and caught it air-borne with two hands. I'm told he nearly ran 50 metres to catch that. batsman c Rahul b bowler 20(16) [4s-1 6s-1]"
7043,"out Caught by Ashwin!! Excellent final over from bowler. Removed two set batsmen and this could be the game for team? Once again kept it wide from batsman's reach who went chasing after the delivery and much like Smith, he too toe-ended it into the air. Ash runs back from extra cover and clings onto a dolly of a catch. batsman c Ashwin b bowler 30(25) [6s-1]"
7044,"SIX, Ben batsman is a no non-sense cricketer! Sits on one knee and smokes this floater flat over mid-wicket. Huge hit"
7045,"out Caught by (sub)Nair!! Rush of blood! bowler's done him with the googly, this time batsman gave himself plenty of room and wanted to go over long-on, hasn't quite middled it and picks out the sub fielder Karun Nair in the deep. batsman c (sub)Nair b bowler 6(2) [6s-1]"
7046,"out Caught by Rahul!! The Royals are falling apart. It's been some crumble. Tripathi danced down the pitch and met the ball on the full, only to spoon the easiest of catches to KL Rahul at long-on. batsman c Rahul b bowler 1(4)"
7047,"out batsman Run Out!! Trouble. More trouble for team. Another pinpoint yorker from bowler, Archer couldn't lay bat on ball and he tried to steal a bye after it snuck past the leg stump, Pooran throws and misses, bowler doesn't miss it this time though. Collects the ball mid-pitch and sees both batsmen stranded in the middle. Walks forward and disoldges the bails at the striker's end with supreme ease. batsman run out (Pooran/bowler) 2(2)"
7048,"out Caught&Bowled!! Short ball, batsman top-edges it high into the air, both keeper and the bowler go for it without any sort of communication. Ankit bowler charges and clasps it safely before crashing into Pooran who seems to have taken some serious knock on the head from the big man. Good effort from bowler to keep his eyes on the ball and not fumble despite tumbling after the crash. batsman c and b bowler 1(2)"
7049,out Caught by Shami!! Low full toss and it's been chipped off the toe-end to Shami at mid-off who gathers the ball after a slight fumble on the first attempt. I'm afraid this is all but over for team. batsman c Shami b bowler 3(4)
7050,"FOUR, pitched up outside off, Kulkarni smashes it off the bottom half but generates enough wrist power to scorch through to the extra cover boundary"
7051,"FOUR, airy drive but in the gap at mid-off. Pitched fuller just outside off, batsman was through his drive early and it pings him slightly high on the bat. Hence, it went in the air and beats Ashwin"
7052,"FOUR, batsman unfurls his expertise. Hammers it on a short of length, batsman walks across and scoops it over short fine leg. Cheeky and mighty effective"
7053,"FOUR, batsman has had enough. Opens his stance, knew what was coming and blasted it hard. Lost his timing and shape, dragged it off the toe-end and it beats mid-off. Long-on does his best but in vain"
7054,"SIX, high and handsome over long-off. Flighted just outside off, batsman loads up and smashes it for a maximum"
7055,"FOUR, help-yourself-to-a-boundary ball from bowler. Short and down leg, fine leg was inside the ring and batsman swivel-pulls it behind square on the leg-side"
7056,"FOUR, why on earth would you bowl short and wide to anyone? batsman treks and allows the hands to take over. Carved over point for a four"
7057,"SIX, that would have been applauded at the Flushing Meadows! That was a superb forehand down the ground. Powered over long-on. Flat and muscular"
7058,"FOUR, full, wide, sliced and a four. The ball raced between short third and point for a four. Reached the ball with his tentacles and managed to thread the ball into the gap"
7059,"FOUR, that is power and placement combined! Packs a punch with a shot on the up and the ball speeds away through the off-side for a four into the covers. team end the powerplay period on a high"
7060,"FOUR, batsman has carried on from where he left it in the 2018 IPL. His purple run in the pink and blue continues. Slower delivery outside off, batsman pumps it over mid-off to bring about his fifty off 29 balls"
7061,out Bowled!! The carrom ball bowled quicker and it hits the target as it explodes into the top of off. A wicket out of nowhere for team and it is their skipper who has provided it. That might have skidded on after landing on the grassier part of the wicket. batsman tried to dab it and missed. batsman b bowler 27(20) [4s-4]
7062,"FOUR, deft, innovative, just batsman things..goes across his sticks and scoops the pacer over short fine's head for a four. This man is a killer of bowling plans. The field is bound to change"
7063,"FOUR, and what does he do now? Backs away, creates oodles of room and allows his hands to power it over cover for a four to deep extra. Again, the power and placement worked in tandem over there"
7064,"FOUR, third successive delivery straying on the pads, the length was short, so it won't swing, Shaw pulls, can't tell he controlled that but he placed it well wide of the man at square leg/widish mid-wicket"
7065,"FOUR, so he bowls three dots, there is this urge to get your name in the wickets column, especially in this format and in this tournament, so Thakur tries the fancy slower ball when back of a length was perfectly working for him, Shaw pounces on the short delivery and powers the pull over mid-wicket"
7066,"FOUR, that's back-to-back boundaries now. Shaw has changed gears and he got the momentum he wanted. It's another short ball from Thakur, not the kind of short ball that rises to head, Shaw stays back and flat-bats it over mid-on"
7067,"FOUR, for a second, bowler thought that he had flummoxed the batsman with his googly but batsman made incredible adjustment despite not reaching the pitch. Throws his hand fully and blasts it past the non-striker. Nobody is stopping that"
7068,"FOUR, consecutive fours for batsman. He's started to up the ante. Gets low, takes it in front of the stumps and slog-sweeps it powerfully in front of square. Threads the gap at deep mid-wicket and collects a boundary"
7069,"out Lbw!! Gonzo! Terrible misjudgement from Iyer and he pays the price. Made room to a slider from bowler, ended up getting too close for comfort as it zips through and crashes his front pad first. The appeal was spontaneous and only question there was whether it was pad first as Iyer did make contact with the bat later. Umpire Nitin Menon was sure about it and raised his finger. Iyer also knew it and started walking. HawkEye says that it's smashing the off-stump. batsman lbw b bowler 18(20) [6s-1]"
7070,"FOUR, batsman exploits the field. Too short and wide of off, batsman quickly shifts his weight back and punches it past Bhajji at cover, who gaves a desperate chase but the ball wins the race"
7071,"FOUR, almost prised out batsman with his first ball. Fuller and straightened just outside off, batsman was pushing forward without any intent and feeds an outside edge which beats MS to his left and runs away to the third man boundary"
7072,"FOUR, slower version of Bravo's slower ball but gets the line wrong. Loads of width and batsman works it in his favour by going deep and cuts it fiercely past point"
7073,"FOUR, oh another freebie from Bravo and batsman cashes in with a sublime straight drive. Low full toss, misses the yorker and batsman plants his front leg forward, drilling it ram-rod straight and shows his bat maker's name. Long-off and long-on fielders were mere spectators"
7074,"SIX, wowza! For a moment, it looked like batsman had mistimed this but nope, got enough timing on it to clear Shardul at long-off. bowler has his hands on his head. Slowish and serves it outside off, batsman throws his bat and didn't connect it off the middle. Came off the toe-end but such is his power that it sails a leaping Shardul for a maximum"
7075,"out Caught by SN Thakur!! Killer blow! Shardul Thakur has made a tough catch look very simple. batsman's cameo comes to an end and team have lost an important wicket. Length delivery, straighter at the stumps and jerked his lower body, unfurling a whippy-pull uppishly towards deep square leg. Thakur ran swiftly to his right, cushions it neatly and slides before completing the catch. They have also called for a time-out. batsman c SN Thakur b bowler 25(13) [4s-2 6s-1]"
7076,"out Caught by Raina!! Catching practice for Raina at extra cover. Bravo breaks into a jig and team on top now. Two wickets in three balls and team are in trouble. It was fuller and just outside off, seemed to have stopped on the wicket a tad and batsman checks his shot early and airly to Raina, who makes no mistake. Could this be the game-changing over? batsman c Raina b bowler 2(2)"
7077,"out Bowled!! Off-stumps takes a beating! Typical bowler delivery. It was a faster one, it spins away sharply from Paul who plays inside the line of it and it rips past the outside edge. Paul hasn't been able to find his groove in the IPL so far. batsman b bowler 0(4)"
7078,"2 runs, flatter one on the stumps and batsman pulls it wide of deep mid-wicket for a brace. And brings up his fifty with it. He has played the role of anchor to perfection but can he provide the power-hitting in the slog overs?"
7079,"out Caught by SN Thakur!! Third wicket for bowler in a span of 6 balls. He is having a whale of a time at Kotla. The pitch is tailor-made for his style of bowling and he is making full use of it. It was a slower one on the stumps, batsman was taken aback by how slowly it came off the deck. He was way too early on the hoick, it comes off the leading edge and Shardul takes a fine catch near deep mid-wicket. batsman c SN Thakur b bowler 51(47) [4s-7]"
7080,"FOUR, this shot will get the Delhi crowd going! It was on a back of a length and was attacking the stumps, batsman moves to the off-side a touch, clears leg-side for himself and tonks it over short fine for a boundary"
7081,"FOUR, bowler misses his length horribly this time. It was a slower nut on the stumps and was a full-toss, batsman moves to the off-side and half-scoops it fine of short fine for a boundary"
7082,"FOUR, nicely guided away to third man, a slide by Deepak Chahar and he's let the ball go through. Dhoni won't be happy, with the bowler first for needlessly trying stuff, and with the fielder for his effort. Hat-trick of fours now"
7083,"FOUR, this is a dream start for team. Four boundaries in four balls now. You can't complain about this ball though. Nice good length delivery outside off stump, batsman punches off the front foot and gets a thick edge that rolls fine and beats third man"
7084,"FOUR, there he comes racing down the pitch to the offie with the ball turning in and plays the lofted drive, didn't connect with the middle of the bat, toe-ends it well enough to beat mid-off into the fence"
7085,"FOUR, swept and swept fine, flighted delivery from round the wicket, batsman took a big stride forward and powered that on his knees by rolling the wrists over the shot to keep it all along the ground through backward square leg"
7086,"out Caught by Watson!! This is very good limited overs bowling from bowler. We saw him adjust very well to Dhawan when he was given the charge, now Shaw runs down the pitch to smash the bowler, but bowler takes pace off, shortens the length and also follows the batsman, leaving Shaw nowhere to go. The batsman backs himself to play the pull shot, only mistimes it as far as mid-wicket. A dolly for Watto! batsman c Watson b bowler 24(16) [4s-5]"
7087,"FOUR, this is good batting, knows bowler isn't going to toss the ball up, so has a short backlift to reverse lap this flatter ball past short third man"
7088,"1 run, in the airrrrr but it drops short of Dududu Rayudu. But he does extremely well to get his hand behind the line and save the boundary. batsman steps out and flicks without control, gets away with it as it lands right in front of deep mid-wicket"
7089,"SIX, hint of flight and Iyer's eyes light up. Loads up big time and clears his front leg to deposit into the empty stands over long-off. First six of the innings!"
7090,"FOUR, third successive delivery straying on the pads, the length was short, so it won't swing, Shaw pulls, can't tell he controlled that but he placed it well wide of the man at square leg/widish mid-wicket"
7091,"FOUR, so he bowls three dots, there is this urge to get your name in the wickets column, especially in this format and in this tournament, so Thakur tries the fancy slower ball when back of a length was perfectly working for him, Shaw pounces on the short delivery and powers the pull over mid-wicket"

7116,"SIX, batsman gets off the mark with a maximum. A looped up ball, full and in batsman's arc. The southpaw stands tall and thumps it over long-off"
7117,"FOUR, carrom ball, but the length is short, batsman muscles the pull through mid-wicket. Tye moves to his left from long-on, but is lethargic to bend low"
7118,"SIX, shot! batsman gets down on a knee and slogs this length ball over the deep mid-wicket"
7119,"SIX, full toss and Rana has launched it into the crowd over mid-wicket. That's a gimme and batsman took full toll of it"
7120,"SIX, another one from batsman! For a fleeting moment he seemed to have mistimed it, but the breeze takes it over the boundary ropes. Fired wide of off, Rana reaches out and toe-ends the lofty hit over wide long-off"
7121,"FOUR, seems like Ashwin has ran out of options...a short and wide hit-me from bowler and batsman smacks it off the back foot behind point. Too easy"
7122,"SIX, another one in the zone and this time it's batsman! Clears his front leg and clouts the length ball over cow corner"
7123,"SIX, flat and over the leaping fielder at sweeper cover! Two sixes in a row. Was smidgen short and Rana freed his arms to slap it over Shami in the deep"
7124,"FOUR, back-to-back fifties for batsman! A dolly of a delivery from Hardus bowler, sprayed into the pads and Rana just puts bat to ball. Fine leg inside the ring and that's a easy boundary"
7125,"SIX, hits back of a length and Rana clubs it over long-on with ease! Set himself on the back foot and mauled it with full might"
7126,"FOUR, full and wide, sliced away backwards of point. Excellent timing and even better placement from batsman"
7127,"out Caught by Agarwal!! Maiden IPL wicket for Varun bowler! A moment he'll remember for a long, long time. Rana just had one aim: to slog and slog big. Goes for it but doesn't quite get it off the middle and his attempt to go over cover fails miserably. Skews it off the cue-end and Mayank Agarwal takes a brilliant catch running in from long-off. batsman c Agarwal b bowler 63(34) [4s-2 6s-7]"
7128,"FOUR, 24th IPL fifty for Robin batsman! Gets there with a boundary, perhaps the easiest ball faced in his entire IPL career. A full ball slanting down leg, batsman just needed to meet that and meet that he did. Clean and quick into the fine leg fence"
7129,"FOUR, very full delivery on the pads, 143km/h, whipped away to the backward square leg fence for four where Chakravarthy puts in the dive but fails to cut it off - a little slow to start, Varun, and the practice pitch didn't help"
7130,"SIX, are ya kiddin' me? A slower one aimed at the body, into the ribcage, Russell just twists into a pull, gets a massive top-edge that sails over fine leg for six - speaking of laws of the game, what happened to the bat-laws?"
7131,"FOUR, short one, slow, well-directed, but he's picked it - Russell waits for it and absolutely smites that pull to the deep mid-wicket boundary for four"
7132,"FOUR, to give you an idea of how high it went, the camera did well to follow it, but it did seem clouded by the - well, clouds for a moment. A tad short, Russell swats across the line, gets another massive top-edge, and it is absolutely skied. So high, that even Rahul, the 'keeper, has reached the fine leg fence and tries to pull it back but it beats him, one bounce, to the fence"
7133,"SIX, length ball, a sin at this point, right in the arc, and Russell opens up to cart that over long-on for six"
7134,"SIX, 143.1km/h, an inch too short for the yorker length = half-volley, Russell opens up his stance, clears the front-leg, and absolutely clouts that over long-off for six"
7135,"SIX, attempts another yorker, errs on the fuller side this time, a full-toss in the slot, Russell swings across the line, clubs a gigantic six over cow corner - spectators of Bengal, watch out!"
7136,"SIX, another full-toss, 142.9km/h, from round the wicket, misses the yorker by a long way, clearly holding the ball too tight, Russell follows that algorithm of opening up that stance for a trigger and carts it over deep mid-wicket for six"
7137,"FOUR, looks like he's just streamed that 2011 flick ""Carnage"" before getting to the ground, has DreRuss. A wide half-volley this time, clearly indicating that bowler has lost the plot, and Russell has absolutely smoked that through deep extra cover for four. Gaps? The fielders can't see that whizzing projectile - such is the power. That's the second 25-run over in the innings."
7138,"out Caught by Agarwal! Short ball angling in but still outside off, Russell needs no distance parameter to get leverage on that - the force is more than enough - but then, Agarwal at the cow corner fence, hops up to take a magnificent catch. Absolute carnage once again, and he's done his job, has DreRuss. Misses out on a fifty for the second time in a row. batsman c Agarwal b bowler 48(17) [4s-3 6s-5]"
7139,"SIX, 25 off the over! Not the start the debutant would have hoped for. The pressure got to him and he darted a full ball on the pads. Easy pickings for batsman, who flicked it over backward square leg"
7140,"FOUR, it's raining boundaries! Hint of width on offer outside off and that's sufficient for Lynn, who stays in his crease and carves it over point"
7141,"FOUR, biffed! Watch out, Narine. A short of length delivery at 139kph, Lynn pummells the straight-pull over a ducking Narine at the non-striker's end. No chance for mid-on"
7142,"out Caught by Miller!! One shot too many? But, that's how Lynn plays. A seam-up back of a length delivery at 144.3kph, Lynn goes for another straight-pull from the crease. Went too hard and in the process lost his shape. The ball ballooned up off the top-edge. It went up a long way and Miller called for it. The South African settled under it by moving to his right from extra cover and completed a very good catch. team have the breakthrough! batsman c Miller b bowler 10(10) [4s-2]"
7143,"no run, dropped! bowler has put down a tough return catch. A back of a length delivery on the stumps and batsman wanted to slap it straight down the ground. Doesn't get the required elevation and it went to the bowler at a catchable height. bowler went with both hands in his followthrough, but the ball didn't stick"
7144,"FOUR, oh that's a fantastic shot! Tries backing away towards the on-side initially, then steps across shaping up to scoop, and then moves back again, only to steer that back of a length slower delivery in the channel late, with an open face, wide of backward point towards the deep backward point fence for four to finish off the innings..."
7145,"out Caught by Rahul!! team have lost both their openers now. A hit-the-deck-hard back of a length delivery that cramps the batsman for room. batsman clears his front leg for a pull shot, gets a top-edge that pops up a long way in the air. KL Rahul, the man with the gloves, moves backwards to snaffle it. batsman c Rahul b bowler 24(9) [4s-1 6s-3]"
7146,"SIX, shot! bowler provided a bit of width outside off on this short of length delivery and batsman used his quick hands to great effect. Carved it over backward point and the ball has enough wings to go the distance"
7147,"SIX, batsman goes after bowler with deep mid-wicket and long-on in place. It was floated up outside off, batsman got down, fetched it from there and slogged it over cow corner. Good contact"
7148,"FOUR, a freebie! A 91kph, short-and-wide ball, cut hard to the left of backward point. Raced away"
7149,"FOUR, away-turner, but the length is on the shorter side and there's too much width outside off. batsman won't miss out. He rocks back and cuts it fiercely to the right of backward point"
7150,"SIX, bowler gives a lot of air on this off-break, but the length is slightly too full. batsman gets down on a knee and bludgeons it over long-on for half a dozen"
7151,"SIX, touch short and Rana pounces on it. Keeps his head still and smacks it from outside off for a 80-metre flat maximum over long-on"
7152,"1 run, low full toss on the stumps, Rana pushes it down to long-on and brings up the 50-run stand"
7153,"SIX, 145.1km/h, too short and too wide, batsman has no interest in it until the ball is almost parallel to him, no unnecessary movement, just gets under it and upper-cuts it over third man for six!"
7154,"FOUR, short of length delivery rising steeply outside off, batsman backs away and tries carving it away through the point regio, gets a massive top-edge over slip for a boundary to third man"
7155,"out Caught by Kuldeep Yadav! An abomination fo a shot for an Indian Test opener. batsman backs away into the on-side, picks up a length ball from middle-stump, 145.7km/h, and tries to run his hands through the ball in chipping it over mid-off, miscues and and ends up lobbing it straight to the man at mid-off, succumbing in a rather soft manner. That was pressure. Pressure talking. batsman c Kuldeep Yadav b bowler 1(5)"
7156,"FOUR, a whippy sweep-type-clip off the pads as it was too full for batsman to abort his attempted sweep. So, he bent a little and whipped it away past the dive of the deep square leg fielder for a four. The rate required is now 14.2"
7157,"SIX, and the sweep gets him out of jail. Emphatically. Knelt down and smacked it. The bat made a massive noise as it met the ball. The ball whistled over deep mid"
7158,"SIX, too full, the leverage was there and he has muscled it over the bowler's head for a towering sixer. Massive hit from Killer batsman"
7159,"FOUR, smashes the ball away again. Shortish ball and has been pulled away past deep mid for a four"
7160,"FOUR, slapped! That was powered down the ground. Not too far from the bowler, not too far from the sticks and the ball escaped into the fence"
7161,"FOUR, and cheeky! Waits on it and opens the face of the blade to glide it away to deep third man for a four"
7162,"SIX, oh these bats, modern day cricket, power, so cruel for the bowler. Quickish delivery on the leg stump, batsman was caught between a sweep shot and a pull shot, but he's somehow sweetly muscled this to clear backward square leg"
7163,"2 runs, flicked wide of long-on, two is call and he's home. Fifty for batsman, his 4th in IPL, good length delivery on the stumps, batsman hits the gap nicely on that occasion"
7164,"2 runs, in the airrr, dropped, Rinku Singh the sub! Flighted delivery outside off stump, batsman steps out and reaches out to this widish delivery, sliced it, Rinku ran to his left and dived full length forward but it didn't stick"
7165,"FOUR, down the track to drill this hard wide of short cover, Dre Russ slides and stops the ball, but was his back foot in touch with the rope when he was in contact with the ball? Third umpire checks, four it is"
7166,"out Bowled!! The googly and it takes out the leg stump. batsman on one knee to slog-sweep it for six, but missed the ball completely and lost the pole. A fine fifty from batsman, but team needed him to push a little more hard chasing 219. batsman b bowler 58(34) [4s-6 6s-1]"
7167,"no run, this is a very wide short ball, batsman tried to fetch the pull shot, missed, the ball sneaked under the under edge, Karthik was confident in his appeal, given out and batsman overturned the call by reviewing"
7168,"SIX, this is a lovely lofted off-drive, nothing better than this sort of a shot to get going. Length ball, nice pitch to bat on, so batsman hit through the line and collected a maximum"
7169,"FOUR, this is class batting, knows third man is inside the ring, as soon as bowler dropped the slower ball short, batsman was there to just guide in the gap wide of backward point"
7170,"FOUR, low full toss, drilled hard between the sticks and the non-striker, Dre Russ can't cut it off running from long-off"
7171,"FOUR, clever hit, short delivery rising steeply, batsman stays leg side of the ball and guides it over Karthik for a much needed boundary"
7172,"FOUR, short delivery outside off stump, batsman stays back and cuts past backward point, third man doesn't have a real go. Fours won't do it for team"
7173,"2 runs, slower delivery on the leg stump, tucked away towards mid-wicket, easy two. Fifty up for batsman, but no celebrations"
7174,"SIX, now then, team need seven more of these. But hey, this bloke has backed away to this full ball and somehow sliced this ball over backward point, normally you see the ball travel over cover, incredible hit"
7175,"FOUR, short googly, pulled away to deep mid-wicket, Uthappa runs to his right, gets to the ball but fumbles as he tries to hop and stop the ball"
7176,"FOUR, bowler is only going to bowl googlies, so batsman moves across and scoops the ball over Lynn at short fine leg"
7177,"FOUR, 142.7km/h, length delivery angling into the pads, towards middle, batsman shuffles across and closes the face at the last moment whilst on the backfoot to guide it away towards the deep square leg boundary for four"
7178,"FOUR, oh that is laced! Backs away into the on-side, picks up the length ball on off-stump, and absolutely flays that over the in-field to the deep extra cover fence for four"
7179,"FOUR, 149.2km/h, really quick, but strays on the pads, a full-toss, whipped away to the deep mid-wicket boundary for four. Easy pickings"
7180,"FOUR, short of length delivery on the stump, 115.9km/h, batsman clears that leg and clubs it off the toe-end just over mid-on to the long-on fence for four"
7181,"SIX, 142.9km/h, doesn't take the pace off this time, short one on the stumps, but batsman's trigger is to back away into the on-side - he's absolutely clubbed that, cross-batted, over the long-on fence for six. A fantastic first four balls, spoiled by the last two balls..."
7182,"out Caught by Prasidh! What can't you do DreRuss? Have you got a deal cut out with the God of fortune? A short one at the body, not particularly quick @130.8km/h, batsman gets his weight on the backfoot to pull it away, but with that bat-face turning upwards, gets it off the splice, skywards, as Prasidh runs in to pick it up at mid-on. Huge moment in the game, as both the openers depart. batsman c Prasidh b bowler 20(13) [4s-2 6s-2]"
7183,"FOUR, uncanny? Usual batsman stuff as he sits down on both knees and upper-steers it. Risky but effective"
7184,"FOUR, what lovely timing! Shortish delivery outside off and has been chopped behind point for a four. That was just touched and it ran away"
7185,"out Caught by Karthik!! Slower delivery gets the scalp here. That was down leg, batsman ended up closing the face of the bat a bit too early and the leading edge was taken by the keeper, who moved to his left by quite a few paces to take it. Dre Russ continues his impact on this game. And have the deliveries started to hold on more now? Might well be the case. batsman c Karthik b bowler 13(13) [4s-2]"
7186,"FOUR, when in doubt, sweep! Did so of late against Lanka in the T20Is and now also repeating the same. Knelt down and swept it in front of square for a four"
7187,"FOUR, oh, that's a dreadful delivery and Sharma rightly makes him pay. Now attempted the inswinger to Sharma, the line all awry as it is drifted down leg. team captain gets inside the line and glances it very fine to open his account. First boundary and Sharma is away!"
7188,"FOUR, gift for Sharma. Loosener once again from Yadav, sliding it on the pads and Sharma was alert enough to clip it past square leg"
7189,"FOUR, inside edge and that nearly shaved the leg-stump. batsman is very lucky that it missed the sticks. It was the indipper at 144kph, batsman was chained to his crease and didn't expect it to come back into him. Had a late poke at it and the ball trims the inside edge and runs away to the fine leg fence. Remember, he was caught off an inside edge last year too - at this same venue"
7190,"FOUR, a short of length delivery, batsman picks the length early, stands tall and pummels it through mid-wicket. A desperate dive from the long-on fielder, but in vain"
7191,out Caught by Siraj!! This is a big wicket for team! The home crowd knows that. They go berserk. Umesh Yadav has a beaming smile on his face. A hit-the-deck-hard back of a length delivery wide of off and Umesh induces a rare miscued pull shot from batsman. The ball ballooned up off the top-edge. Siraj comes forward from long-off to gobble it up. batsman c Siraj b bowler 48(33) [4s-8 6s-1]
7192,"SIX, batsman has had enough of the miscues. Backs his power and goes for the biggie. It was a flat length ball, the right-hander stood tall and bludgeoned it over long-on. Didn't worry about his shape, there did Suryakumar"
7193,"FOUR, classy batting, this from SKY! Uses his writs to superb effect. Moeen darted a length ball and Suryakumar superbly clipped it through the mid-wicket region. Split the gap between deep mid-wicket and long-on perfectly. The last two balls have spoilt the over"
7194,"SIX, a freebie from bowler and batsman doesn't need second invitations. A half-tracker from the leggie, batsman rocks back and muscles the pull over deep mid-wicket"
7195,"SIX, kaboom! Vintage Yuvi. Yuzvendra bowler over-corrects and doles out a half-volley. Right in the southpaw's slot and batsman has bludgeoned it straight down the ground"
7196,"SIX, hat-trick of sixes! bowler bowls this wider outside off, batsman goes deep in the crease and also moved towards off to hoist it over long-on. He lofted it off the back foot"
7197,"out Caught by Siraj!! batsman wanted to go for the fourth six, but holes out. A fullish googly marginally outside off, it was in the slot for the lefty to go over long-off. But, the bat turned at the point of impact. Siraj, at long-off, initially misjudged as he was a couple of yards inside the boundary rope. However, he recovered well and timed his jump perfectly to take a pressure catch. batsman c Siraj b bowler 23(12) [6s-3]"
7198,"FOUR, cheeky and effective! A dibbly-dobbly length ball around off, Suryakumar gets down on a knee and paddles it over short fine leg"
7199,"FOUR, got to feel for the bowler here? batsman wants to play a premeditated scoop shot. It was the off-cutter and the ball bounced a tad more than the batter expected it to. Catches the top-edge and flies over the keeper's head for a boundary"
7200,"out Caught by Moeen Ali!! An away-turning leg-break at 82.4kph, a backing away batsman had to reach out for it. He was trying to carve it over the covers, but ended up slicing it off the cue end. Moeen Ali settles under it at point and takes a calm catch. batsman c Moeen Ali b bowler 38(24) [4s-4 6s-1]"
7201,"1 run, bowler has put down a return catch! A tossed up leggie and batsman pushes with hard hands. The bowler went with both hands moving to his left, but the ball doesn't stick"
7202,out Caught by Hetmyer!! The extra ball has benefited the home side. The previous ball was wrongly wided and bowler has dismissed the dangerous batsman off his last ball of the spell. Another floated leggie outside off and batsman decided to go for the inside-out loft. Off the outer half and also bottom part. Hetmyer gathers it with both hands at sweeper cover. batsman c Hetmyer b bowler 5(6)
7203,"out Caught by Navdeep Saini!! A bumper and batsman plays a hook shot. He's been caught at fine leg by Saini. But, has he made contact with the boundary rope? The umpires send it upstairs. It's a legal ball. And, no part of the boot/pant has touched the ad-cushions. Krunal has to walk back. team continue to take wickets. It was a pacy bumper and Krunal made decent contact after getting inside the line. However, Saini timed his jump to perfection. Once again, cricket shows you the value of an inch or two! batsman c Navdeep Saini b bowler 1(2)"
7204,"out Bowled!! Another one bites the dust. A seam-up ball from a short of length, batsman stands tall to heave across the line when he could have cut it through the off-side. All he manages is an inside edge that cannons onto the stumps. batsman b bowler 1(4)"
7205,"FOUR, poor ball with a slip in place! A short of length delivery on the pads. batsman shuffles and glances. Off the inside edge and the ball races away to the fine leg fence"
7206,"FOUR, 141kph, full on off and middle, batsman moves across and there's the quick hands from Pandya to flick it through backward square leg"
7207,"FOUR, stand and deliver! Saini doles out a full toss, batsman stays put in his crease and lifts it over the bowler's head. No big back-lift, but still manages to generate the botttom hand power. The batter poses for the photographs"
7208,"SIX, 137.4kph, shortish ball that sits up nicely. Having already shuffled across, Hardik waited for the ball to come to him. A pivot across, followed by a fierce pull over deep mid-wicket. That's mighty"
7209,"out Caught by Parthiv Patel!! In-slanter at 135kph just outside off, batsman tries to run it down to third man and gets a faint inside edge. The team players went up straightaway and umpire S Ravi was late to raise his finger. The fielder from the off-side and threw the ball towards the bowler's end to effect a run-out. In the end, Ravi confirmed that it was caught-behind! batsman c Parthiv Patel b bowler 6(5) [4s-1]"
7210,"leg byes, 1 run, 144.7kph, very full ball on the pads, batsman misses the flick and is struck on the front leg in front of leg. team went up for a review, but that was more out of desperation. The batters stole a run and Hardik will be on strike"
7211,"SIX, huuuuge! Mohammed bowler bowls a fullish ball, Hardik stays deep in the crease and it ends up right in his slot. Gets underneath it and massacres it straight down the ground"
7212,"SIX, over deep mid. This is the biggest! It's gone outta here. Once again, bowler misses his yorker by a couple of inches, batsman stays deep in the crease and uses his wrists to send it out of the ground. For those stuck in the traffic jam, watch out!"
7213,"FOUR, neatly driven and it beats the packed off-side field. Half-volley just outside off, tempting Sharma who leans across and creams it magnificently through extra cover"
7214,"FOUR, ""That is a typical left-hander's shot,"" says Haydos on air. batsman makes excellent adjustment by taking a stride down the pitch and converts this into a full ball, then unleashes a clean swing by whacking it past mid-on. That was timed extremely hard and rockets away to the boundary"
7215,"SIX, never bowl short to batsman, Saini learns why. Bends his back and goes short, batsman quickly shifts his weight back and pulls, not too convincing but enough timing on it to send it into the deep mid-wicket stands. Imperious from team captain"
7216,"SIX, woah! This is a shot of authority from batsman. Effortless and dominant stuff from the South African. bowler served it up in the slot, batsman takes his front foot forward and freed his arms, making proper connection to launch over long-on. He's the batsman in form!"
7217,"1 run, oh close! Risky single attempted and batsman had to dive full-length to make his ground. Tucked into the leg-side and got the nod from his skipper. bowler swiftly moved across and collected the ball before hurling the stumps at the non-striker's end, that was a nervy moment for batsman"
7218,"FOUR, slapped past mid-off. Dismissive from batsman. Sees a pitched up delivery outside off, loads up and absolutely smacks it off the meat with ferocity. All power from the team skipper"
7219,"FOUR, dropped. CDG is the culprit and it should've been taken. A straightforward chance but the Kiwi all-rounder fails to cling onto it. Whacked hard and towards mid-wicket, I reckon CDG mistimed his jump and it bursted through his fingers. You cannot drop a form batsman like batsman and this will hurt team"
7220,"FOUR, 50 comes up for team with this boundary. They are off to a great start here. Saini misses his mark and hurls a delivery just outside off, batsman went hard at that and skewed it over extra cover. Didn't come off the middle as the bat face turned in his hands"
7221,"out Bowled!! 50th scalp for bowler at the Chinnaswamy. Told ya! He's team's trumpcard and straightaway gets his team the breakthrough. CDG will be a relieved man for sure. Poor shot from batsman, especially having tried this off the first ball of the over. Spinning into him and the Southpaw went for the fancy reverse after taking his front foot forward. Was in no position to play that shot and gets an under-edge which deflects back onto the stumps. The home crowd goes bonkers as team pick up their first wicket. batsman b bowler 23(20) [4s-2 6s-1]"
7222,"byes, FOUR, the non-turner outside off, batsman goes for a premeditated sweep shot and the ball scoots under his blade. Kept low too and hence the keeper couldn't stop that"
7223,"FOUR, 85.6kph, bowler gives air on this occasion, but he's drifted it down leg. Easily put away by batsman, who gets down on a knee and powerfully sweeps it backward of square leg"
7224,"FOUR, another off-pace delivery - 111.5kph. The skipper picks it, gets down on a knee and swipes it over square leg. There's no one in the deep there"
7225,"FOUR, Chota Gayle hits the first boundary for team. Easy length ball drifting down the leg-side, just the roll of the wrists on this shot and he placed it wide of mid-wicket"
7226,"FOUR, enough of dots, batsman wants to get on with the game! Gets a full legbreak on off, with a high back lift and thumping wrists he powers it down the ground for a blazing boundary"
7227,"SIX, in the arc and that's gone! Lovely floater outside off, AB gets underneath it and smites it over wide long-off with the cleanest of bat swings you'll ever see"
7228,"SIX, slower, loopy, leg-stump. Okay, does it matter to a batsman like AB? He just stands his ground and whiplashes it into the crowd over backward square. Gee, the ease..."
7229,"out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! bowler gets the better of Virat batsman! Gets him with a short ball. Pounds it into the pitch and gets it to angle in into the body, batsman hadn't really moved back, but still goes through with the shot (pull) and the top-edge lands in the bucket hands of Hardik Pandya at square leg. batsman c Hardik Pandya b bowler 46(32) [4s-6]"
7230,"FOUR, bowler is not happy with the effort from Suryakumar Yadav. Was a tough one, but chance nonetheless! No feet from AB, just swats the pull from the crease and it went flat to the right of wide long-on, SKY did well to anticipate it but in the end he went for the dive and lost track of the ball"
7231,"FOUR, that was pitched halfway down the track, AB hammers it with brute power over mid-wicket. Hadn't got the timing right, but he did well to place it in the gap"
7232,"FOUR, huge appeal for lbw, but no signs of review and rightly so. Off the willow. A loopy full toss from bowler, AB had walked a long way and had to adjust to the line at the last moment, plants his front knee onto the ground and manages to find a flicker of an inside edge on the slog to send it fine past the keeper"
7233,"SIX, length ball outside off, AB clubs it clean over extra cover. That's gone straight into the second tier"
7234,"SIX, too predictable from bowler. Another slower ball and the length is way too short, AB had all the time in the world to pick his spot and he marmalizes it into the mid-wicket orbit without breaking sweat"
7235,"out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! Needless stuff from batsman. Wanted to go for the glory hit and perished; was fullish and angling in, batsman made room early and cleared his front leg to go over the leg-side, slices it off the toe-end and Hardik Pandya takes the simplest of catches at mid-off. batsman c Hardik Pandya b bowler 5(6)"
7236,"1 run, 29th IPL fifty for AB batsman! Punches a length ball square of sweeper cover and gets to the landmark with an air of nonchalance"
7237,"no run, clipped to the left of mid-wicket and they think of a quick single, Suryakumar Yadav was quick to gather the ball and he missed the direct hit at the batting end"
7238,"FOUR, AB shuffles and meets this ball on the full, sits on one knee and swats it in the gap between deep mid-wicket and deep square"
7239,"SIX, for a fleeting moment AB seemed to have mistimed it. Wasn't to be. AB was moving to the leg-side but Hardik kept it wide of off, bowled it on a length and made AB fetch; carved off the bottom half but no problems, it keeps traveling and sails over the leaping sweeper cover fielder"
7240,"SIX, full toss on the pads, see you tomorrow! Can't bowl there to AB and that's disappeared at the rate of knots. Straight into the third tier over square leg"
7241,"out Caught by Krunal Pandya!! Similar lines again: wide of off, CDG thumps it into the air sans any conviction and KP at sweeper cover runs forward to snaffle a dolly of a catch. batsman c Krunal Pandya b bowler 2(7)"
7242,"SIX, this is why he's been picked in the IPL. Shows no sign of nerves and pumps the full ball over long-off, bowler didn't have the pace to trouble the batsman and it was righ in the slot for a left-hander"
7243,"1 run, dropped! Bumrah is the culprit. Slower length delivery outside off, Dube slices it high into the air and it kept swirling backwards behind the keeper, Bumrah runs back from short third but can't cling onto it"
7244,"FOUR, that's a nice pull shot, he's short in stature, but he packs a punch with his shots. A gentle step forward and then a pull over mid-wicket"
7245,"FOUR, top edge, but it flies high over QdK. Short fuller length on the stumps, Moeen was beaten for pace on the pull shot, gets away with it"
7246,"SIX, oh what a shot! bowler will be kicking himself for bowling a freebie full ball on the leg stump, Mo flicks with a strong bottom hand grip and it sails over backward square leg"
7247,"out Moeen Ali Run Out!! This is a big moment. What a direct-hit from the skipper. Mo was starting to time the ball well, a stutter has cost him. Parthiv flicked this slower ball in front of short mid-wicket and set off, Ro attacked the ball and knocked the sticks over with a rocket through. The crowd, disappointed for a fleeting moment with the dismissal, yells out a loud roar. Enter King Kohli! Moeen Ali run out (Rohit) 13(7) [4s-1 6s-1]"
7248,"FOUR, oh this could so easily have been in mid-on's hands. Shortish delivery, batsman pulls off the front foot, not in control, Yuvi was very wide there and had no chance. This is the battle of the best bowler v best batsman"
7249,"FOUR, outside edgeeee but safe! batsman really throws his hands at this length delivery wide outside off stump, wanted a drive through cover, got a thick edge that went wide of slip and beat third man"
7250,"FOUR, this is a brilliant shot. Not a bad ball at all for the field set. Fullish and outside off stump, batsman leans forward and punches it with an angled bat, splits backward point and cover-point"
7251,"FOUR, bowler missed his length by a couple of yards and that's all waht batsman needed to get going. Back of a length and well outside off stump, batsman cuts, beats backward point and look at him, he's fired up. Cheers himself up with a soft of fist pump, he didn't like being dominated/threatened by bowler for those three deliveries"
7252,"FOUR, and look at this cover drive, he's moved onto 20 and all have been boundaries. Fullish delivery outside off stump, batsman leans forward and creams the ball along the ground, raced away to the boundary"
7253,"FOUR, flicked along the ground, big Polly runs to his right and dives, misses the ball and it escapes for four. Too full from bowler and he pays the penalty"
7254,"SIX, this is a brave ball, but Parthiv is a good player of spin and he loves the slog-sweep. Landed full and Parthiv went aerial over mid-wicket"
7255,"FOUR, driven wide of long-off, oh dear, Hardik Pandya has let this go through between his legs. Off-drive along the ground, should have been stopped"
7256,"out Bowled!! A chop on from Chota Gayle. He gets a start, but throws it away. We have seen that way too many times. Did the job though. Googly from bowler, Parthiv goes back to cut, looked too close for the shot and ended up dragging it back onto the sticks. batsman b bowler 31(22) [4s-4 6s-1]"
7257,"no run, Yuvraj Singh, what have you done?. He's dropped batsman first ball. Flatter delivery outside off stump, batsman was looking to punch off the back foot, gets a thick edge that travels, Yuvi moved to his right and the ball came to the left and hit the knee"
7258,"FOUR, just a chip and off she goes. Full and in the slot, batsman extends his forward push and sends it over mid-off, who was inside the ring. The timing was brilliant as the ball flew off the middle"
7259,"FOUR, runs starting to flow from both ends now.. batsman has also up the ante. Picked the short ball and pulled it backward of square, giving the fielder at deep square no chance of getting across"
7260,"SIX, hit-me delivery and batsman obliges. A gift on the pads and batsman picks it up nonchalantly over backward square, struck it flat and got it over the rope. Bhuvi also might have misjudged as he came in before running back, too late by then"
7261,"FOUR, it is not working for bowler. Hyderabad's fifth bowler is becoming a problem. Nadeem leaked runs and bowler too is going for a few. The back of hand but overpitched it, batsman delays the loft and sends it soaring over extra cover, one bounce and over the rope"
7262,"1 run, fifty for batsman. First of the season for the skipper. Just a quick bat raise towards his team and on his goes.. Wrong 'un and on the shorter length, tucked away in front of square on the leg-side"
7263,"FOUR, shot! He's bisected the two fielders with precision. 107ks knuckle ball around off, batsman makes room and drives on the up past extra cover, where KW can't go full throttle on the dive as it is to his left and Rashid also can't get across from sweeper cover"
7264,"2 runs, Rahane was in trouble here. Full and outside off, batsman drives it towards deep extra cover, Rashid swoops down and releases the ball quickly as well but Sandeep fails to gather it, Rahane puts in the dive to make his ground"
7265,"1 run, fifty for batsman. 11th in the league and Rajasthan's mentor, Shane Warne picked him as the player to watch out for in this edition. He's started off nicely. Picked the slower delivery and works it into the open mid-wicket area"
7266,"FOUR, batsman getting innovative. Rashid is taken by surprise. The fast wrong 'un and batsman decides to play the reverse sweep, more of a top-edge and the ball clears backward point before running away to the fence"
7267,"SIX, woah! What timing. Rashid thought he was in with a chance near the rope but the ball kept sailing over him. bowler in an attempt to dart it in offers an half volley, batsman backs away and chips the loft inside out, yes just a chip and off went the ball clearing the rope comfortably"
7268,"FOUR, cheeky! Smart batting by batsman. He knows that bowler is firing 'em in and he uses that to his advantage, walks across his stumps and laps it over the keeper, the pace takes care of the rest"
7269,"out Caught by Manish Pandey!! Gone! The partnership has been broken. But it might be a good thing for Rajasthan. batsman has done his job - setting it up for the likes of Stokes and Gowtham. He shimmies down and is deceived by bowler's dragged back length, still goes through with the loft and gets more height than distance, Pandey takes it easily near long-on. batsman c Manish Pandey b bowler 70(49) [4s-4 6s-3]"
7270,"2 runs, dropped! Bairstow charges from behind the sticks and grasses it. He should have left it to Rashid, who was coming in. batsman is deceived by the knuckle ball and is early into the flick, the leading edge balloons towards square leg, Bairstow sprinted across and Rashid ran forward, in the end the man with the mitts called for it and he only got a tip of the glove on the ball"
7271,"SIX, fabulous shot! This for me is the shot of the innings. The leg-cutter on a length outside off, batsman plonks his front foot forward and lofts it over extra cover. The power he generated on the slower ball was ashtonishing"
7272,"FOUR, wow! He's playing a gem here. Bhuvi misses the yorker by a couple of inches and that is enough for batsman, he opens the bat face and square drives it to the fence. Sweeper had no chance"
7273,"FOUR, and again.. Bhuvi does not look at his best in the death. Taken to the cleaners by Russell in the previous game and now batsman getting stuck into him. Missed the yorker and the squeezed drive beat Pathan near backward point and raced away"
7274,"FOUR, this is class batting. He is toying with the field. Third man was inside the ring, Bhuvi bowled a short of length leg-cutter and batsman opened the bat face to guide it behind square on the off-side - between backward point and short third man"
7275,"FOUR, 24 runs off the over. This is batting of the highest quality. No slogging or blind smashing but pure textbook cricket shots. Full delivery outside off, batsman slices it over the point region and though there was a deep point in place, Pathan could not get there"
7276,"SIX, into the 90s now.. Sandeep offers a friendly full toss just below the waist, batsman deep in the crease is set up for a heave into the leg-side, the ball was right in his arc and he swings it away 20 rows back near deep square leg"
7277,"FOUR, geez! batsman showing he has the innovative game. He set up for the heave, then wanted to scoop but since the line was outside off, he reverse scooped it over short third man and the connection almost took it the distance"
7278,"FOUR, hundred for batsman. Second in the IPL for him. Both have come in the last two seasons. He is making sure that Warne was right about his prediction. A innings of top quality. He raises bat and fist pumps both his hands. The Royals family love it and all are on their feet to applaud the innings. Short of length and batsman slaps the pull to long-on, the fielder gets across and dives but does not get enough to stop the ball"
7279,"FOUR, batsman being cheeky. He telegraphed his ploy very early, batsman shuffled across to get inside the line and scoop it over short fine. He generated enough power to clear the fielder"
7280,"FOUR, 125.3kph. Top hands, and batsman lets them overcompensate for the lack of feet. Leans back, lets it get close and steers his drive square"
7281,"FOUR, Rajasthan Royals finish with a mammoth 198. Bhuvi concedes 45 runs from his last 2 overs. Full and wide outside off, batsman throws the kitchen sink and the outside edge flies over short third man"
7282,"out Bowled!! Yeah, that's how you halt rampagers -- with drift. Rashid starts wide of his crease, entices batsman to go sweeping with the angle. But he gets a little too greedy, shuffling way across, sweeping, and getting fully foxed by the dip, which sneaks under the bat, kisses the glove and is still quick enough to uproot leg. batsman b bowler 5(8) [4s-1]"
7283,"FOUR, streaky edge. batsman has no clue which way this one's spinning, sticks his bat out away from his body desperately and runs it just wide of the diving slip"
7284,"FOUR, this is simple. Sandeep strays into the legs, and batsman isn't foxed on this side of the wicket. Whips, with a lot of bottom-hand, splitting mid-wicket and mid-on"
7285,"SIX, bang in the slot. And here's batsman's lazy elegance. On a knee, swinging, sorry slogging, and depositing it deep into cow corner"
7286,"SIX, another knuckle pace-off. But batsman picks it perfectly, staying on the front foot and pulling it high. Shankar's waiting for this at deep mid-wicket, he leaps one-handed as well, but despite the 73-meter boundary, the timing takes it just over"
7287,"FOUR, deft. batsman clears his back leg, perhaps forcing Rashid to go straighter - which he does - and then uses all his pace on offer to merely stick his bat out in a paddled sweep, very fine"
7288,"1 run, miscued front-footed pull. Straight to long-on. Also, the 50-stand between these two"
7289,"SIX, runs down, gets close to the pitch of it and smacks it straight down. He's been looking for this for quite some time now, and he really needs this"
7290,"FOUR, strays on the pads, swings into the left-hander from round the wicket, a little too much, batsman just has to tickle it away to the fine leg fence for four"
7291,"SIX, geez that's massive! Banged in on a back of a length @143.5km/h, batsman gets his weight on his backfoot and carts that into the second tier over the cow corner fence. Brutal with a dash of panache..."
7292,"FOUR, round the wicket, fires it in flat on a length, batsman steps across and just whip-jabs it with a checked followthrough (or lack thereof) over the fielder at square leg inside the circle for four"
7293,"FOUR, fires it down leg, out of fear more than anything else, batsman gets on his knee and gets some bat on it, deflects it away towards the (extremely) fine leg boundary for four"
7294,"1 run, dropped by Kulkarni at third man! Short one just outside off, angling in, batsman stays low and gets under it, runs his hands through the upper-cut, Dhawal runs from third man in to take the catch but fluffs it - concedes a single"
7295,"out Caught by D Kulkarni!! Dhawal Kulkarni dropped a relatively easy one last over, but he's taken a blinder at long-off. He was close to the boundary, had to jump to grab the ball, got the timing right and managed to hold on and also stay inside the rope. batsman was running back for the second and stood midway in disbelief that the catch was taken. It was a flighted delivery outside off stump, batsman steps out and toe-ends the lofted drive, holes out in the end. So both the set batsmen have been removed in quick succession. batsman c D Kulkarni b bowler 45(28) [4s-6 6s-1]"
7296,"FOUR, oh what a shot! Leans forward and plays that drive with an angled bat to get it past backward point, timing very good and it runs away for four"
7297,"FOUR, lovely pull shot. Short delivery, but batsman rocked back to power it through square leg, Unadkat runs to his left in the deep but can't stop it. But why is he running around near the rope and not bowling?"
7298,"SIX, he's powered this all the way over long-on. Backs away, gets a nice short ball, and batsman flat-batted that hard over the boundary"
7299,"SIX, gee he's hit this really, really hard! Slower delivery, but batsman went back in his crease and positioned himself nicely for the pull shot over mid-wicket, the man in the deep was interested for a bit but it cleared him comfortably"
7300,"SIX, it's a slower ball alright, but this bloke is picking them from the hand, so he's being disguised, nicely gets under the ball and smashes it over mid-wicket"
7301,"FOUR, in the air but wide of backward point, short delivery outside off stump, batsman cuts hard, the fielder jumped to his right inside the circle but it was well past him"
7302,"out Caught by R Tripathi!! This is going to hand. Slower delivery, batsman jumped out of the crease to cut, but this one bounced a tad extra, so batsman couldn't keep it down, easy grab at backward point. batsman c R Tripathi b bowler 14(10) [4s-2]"
7303,"out Caught by (sub)Chopra!! He's mistimed this loft and long-on swallows the ball. This is an area batsman has to work on. He gets set, looks so good, but throws it away. It's something that will be on his mind. Lovely googly from bowler, gave it a lot of air, batsman wanted a maximum, but the bat turned in his hands on impact with the ball and the timing was messed. Anyway, such a good innings from batsman. batsman c (sub)Chopra b bowler 35(15) [4s-1 6s-3]"
7304,"out Lbw!! Appeal and given. bowler wins the Karnataka battle and he's on a hat-trick. Pandey knew he was plumb, didn't bother reviewing. The googly from the bowler, Pandey was lunging forward in his defence, ball hits the pad first and then the bat. Impact in line and it would have crashed into leg at least. Middle and leg according to HawkEye. batsman lbw b bowler 1(4)"
7305,"SIX, gee! The bloke is bowling over 140kph, but Yusuf didn't bother going back to pull this hard, hit it flat and all the way over deep square leg"
7306,"FOUR, that's the strong bottom hand grip on this punch from Rashid, stayed deep in the crease, converted this yorker into a full ball and crashes it to deep cover"
7307,"SIX, oh wow! What a hit and what a shot to finish. Just a whip of the wrists, bowler's pace helped here, but he middled that so well. Leg-side line again from Archer with the yorker, just a flick with those rubber wrists. team win with an over to spare"
7308,"FOUR, wide yorker length delivery @135.8km/h, just slightly too full, ends up being a full toss only after batsman leans forward, just times it through the gap in the cover for four"
7309,"FOUR, short one from round the wicket , cross-seamer, batsman opens up his stance and clubs that pull away to wide long-on for four"
7310,"FOUR, just short of a half-volley, not quite to the pitch, batsman just goes through the line and lofts it over mid-off towards the long-off boundary for four"
7311,"FOUR, another slower one @112.9km/h, batsman backs away into the on-side, gives himself some space, and slaps it over the in-field towards the sweeper cover boundary for four"
7312,"1 run, fuller length delivery on the pads @138.4km/h, clipped away to backward square leg for a single - and that brings up the half-century opening partnership!"
7313,"FOUR, slightly more open-chested from bowler from wide of the crease, angles it into a short of length spot, batsman gets under it and has a slash at it, gets a top-edge that just evades the 'keeper's leap to the third man (almost long stop) boundary for four. 17 off the over!"
7314,"FOUR, that's the mother of all cross-batted shots! @149.4km/h, no width on the short of length delivery, and a straight pull past the non-striker to the long-off fence for four"
7315,"2 runs, short of length delivery angling away @140.3km/h, but not too much, batsman backs away into the on-side and chips it only just over Samson at mid-off towards the extra cover region for a couple to bring up his fifty - raises his bat to the local crowd"
7316,"FOUR, 149.8km/h, but it's a half-volley on the pads - wasted pace. Just an effortless whip to the backward square leg fence for four"
7317,"FOUR, 132.6km/h, that's a slower one, shortish and no width on offer, batsman is asked to manufacture his own, and he does so byb moved away into the on-side and slapping it through the gap in the cover region to the deep extra cover fence for four"
7318,"FOUR, skids through towards leg, batsman steps across and sweeps, in the air for a while, and falls short of Kulkarni at fine leg who can neither catch it, nor stop it, as it goes away for four"
7319,"SIX, right in the swinging arc for batsman, wide and full outside off, batsman steps forward and lofts it flat over long-off for a six"
7320,"FOUR, pulls the length back, nothing wrong with this one, batsman opens the face and threads the needle that is the gap in the cover region - touch and class, and away she goes to the deep extra cover fence for four"
7321,"SIX, what a way to bring up the hundred partnership! Dropped short, a rank half-tracker, batsman uses the depth of the crease, rocks back, and throws his entire weight behind that pull over cow corner for six"
7322,"FOUR, 140.4km/h, back of a length delivery without width, batsman backs away into the on-side, gives himself room, and carves it away towards the deep backward point fence for four. NOT a lot of width, but the arm-power made up for it..."
7323,"out Caught by D Kulkarni! When batsman departs in an away venue, you can hear the combined sound of a city sighing in relief - but at home, you can hear a pin drop. Bangs it in short this time, batsman gets under it by shuffling across to hook, gets a bit of a top-edge and spoons a catch to Kulkarni at the fine leg boundary! The God of Carnage departs. batsman c D Kulkarni b bowler 69(37) [4s-9 6s-2]"
7324,"FOUR, shortish, marginally wide, batsman just stays back and focuses on the placement - carves it away towards the deep backward point fence for four"
7325,"FOUR, batsman plays the ramp now, safe shot as third man was inside the ring - short and well wide of off, he waited on it, opens the face of the bat and ramps it over the empty slip cordon, one bounce and over the ropes"
7326,"SIX, that's quality hitting from batsman. He didn't try to hit it hard, comes close to the ball, keeps his shape and larrups it down the ground. The timing was good enough to clear the long-on fence which is not a short boundary at all"
7327,"1 run, pushes it with the spin to deep cover and he will retain the strike"
7328,"SIX, he is playing the innings of his life in the IPL. Gets a six off the first ball of the over- doing it the Kohli way. Holds his shape, clears his leg and smashes it down the ground for a six"
7329,"out Caught&Bowled!! An excellent innings from batsman comes to an end. He is a disappointed, looks upwards after giving the catch. It was a flatter one on the stumps and batsman smashes it straight back to the bowler. It was hit at a ferocious pace and bowler did really well to grab the catch. He takes off the bails at the non striker's end too, not sure why. batsman c and b bowler 43(21) [4s-4 6s-2]"
7330,"SIX, this is more like batsman. This is the batsman we know. It was a back of a length delivery wide of off, there was enough room available for batsman. He backs away, brings his willow down at a tremendous speed and cuts it over deep backward point for a six"
7331,"FOUR, tell you what, his touch is back. It was fuller and batsman creams it wide of Rohit at cover. He wasn't far from the ball but it was hit very hard and will canter to the fence"
7332,"FOUR, nicely done by batsman! Expensive over from bowler. 19 runs off it. It can be a match-changing over. It was short and was aimed on the body, batsman gently clips it wide of the keeper for a boundary"
7333,"FOUR, fifty for batsman! Not the most ravishing innings but it has been a fighting knock from the Karnataka lad. And he looks like taking his team home. It was a short of length delivery on the face, batsman gets inside the line of the ball and pulls it fine of fine leg for a boundary"
7334,"FOUR, bowler misses the yorker. This is rare from India's number-one bowler. batsman has got his touch back and he punches it wide of long-off for a boundary"
7335,"FOUR, he looks in fabulous touch, how quickly things can change for a batter in this format. It was a back of a length delivery on the stumps, batsman hops a touch and half-pulls it wide of deep square leg for a boundary. Sweet timing!"
7336,"FOUR, smashed! Punjab are just a hit away from winning this. It was a fuller length delivery and was wide of off, batsman backs away, makes room and thumps it wide of deep cover for a boundary. It rockets to the fence!"
7337,"wide, 50-run partnership comes up. It has been a match-winning one for Punjab. bowler gets his line wrong this time, it was well down the leg-side and batsman lets it go"
7338,"FOUR, cheeky from batsman. He is taking his side over the line for sure. It was on a length and there was just a bit of room, batsman waits for it to arrive, opens the face of the bat at the very last moment and guides it fine of third man who had no chance to stop it"
7339,"SIX, massive, you can't bowl short to this man - this simply sat up to be smacked, batsman stands tall and pummels it high and over mid-wicket for a maximum, 101m hit, a colossal one"
7340,"SIX, back-to-back sixes for batsman, his 300th six in IPL, length ball at the stumps, he leans forward and thumps it high and over mid-on, went a long way over the ropes"
7341,"FOUR, beautifully played, fraction too full and well outside off, batsman leans into the drive and places it into the gap past cover-point, beats the infield and runs away to the ropes"
7342,"FOUR, lovely, very full and at the stumps, batsman gets his left leg out of the way and plays a pristine straight drive - past Rahul and beyond Pollard's reach - running across from long-on"
7343,"FOUR, batsman is in his elements today, slower short ball outside off, batsman picked the length early and found the gap past cover-point with the cut"
7344,"SIX, clears the mid-wicket fence, but only just. It's a baby six by batsman's gigantic standards. It was a slower one on the stumps, batsman backs away, clears his front leg and powers it over deep mid-wicket."
7345,"SIX, you can't miss your length by an inch when Universe Boss is in this mood. Attempted yorker goes wrong, batsman goes deep in his crease, makes it into an overpitched delivery and larrups it straight down the ground for a massive six"
7346,out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! Pandya brothers come together to get rid of the Universe Boss! This is excellent captaincy from Rohit. He was brave enough to bring his left-arm spinner against batsman and the man from Baroda hasn't disappointed him. It was wide of off and batsman wanted to clobber it down the ground. Doesn't get it off the sweet spot and it went a long way up in the air. Hardik at long-on takes it with ease in the end. It wasn't the easiest of catches. batsman c Hardik Pandya b bowler 40(24) [4s-3 6s-4]
7347,"FOUR, just a chip shot from batsman but he has timed it to perfection. And has placed it well too. It will beat the straight fielders for a boundary"
7348,"FOUR, he looks in great touch does batsman. It wasn't that bad a delivery, just a little bit short. batsman rocks back and powers it wide of deep mid-wicket for a boundary. He bisected long-on and deep mid-wicket to perfection"
7349,"FOUR, batsman is seeing the ball really well. And he is placing them well too. He goes on the back foot and pulls it wide of deep mid-wicket. Doesn't try to hit it too hard, placement was the key"
7350,"FOUR, 18 off 7! He is playing a gem. Backs away on this delivery, creates his own room, wanted to cut it wide of backward point. Gets an oustide edge and it ends up fine of short fine for a boundary"
7351,"FOUR, can't bowl short to batsman when it's not that high. He'll pick on you every single time. Swivels this time and helps it along, clearing short fine leg quite easily"
7352,"FOUR, classy shot! Sublime stuff from batsman, struck this punchy drive on the up and once he pierced the gap at cover, it was always racing along. It wasn't a bad ball to be honest, just one of those things this man can do when on song"
7353,"FOUR, one-handed check drive from batsman, aerial as well but then, the intention was to clear the infield. Therefore, the deception didn't of the slower ball didn't dent his intent and he went through with the chip shot. Over extra cover and to the fence"
7354,"FOUR, straight as an arrow! Now this shot should boost batsman's morale. Low full toss alright but the execution was admirable. Punchy drive that was straight back past the bowler and it rocketed to the fence. Didn't overhit it and that was the key"
7355,"FOUR, in the air....safe and to the fence! Was a lofted hit from batsman and he got more height than distance on the stroke. Long-on and deep mid-wicket were converging on the stroke but with no real chance of getting to it. The former, Mayank, tried in vain as it landed short of him and to the fence. 50 for QDK! Super knock so far"
7356,"1 run, cramps batsman with this good length ball, stabbed towards extra cover for a sharp run. 50-run stand comes up! Valuable one for team who now have the platform to launch at the death"
7357,"SIX, sensational pick up shot from batsman! Treats bowler as a spinner here by walking across and just drop kicks it over deep square leg. Beautiful connection"
7358,"out Lbw!! Much-needed breakthrough for team. batsman was getting into overdrive and this shot perhaps, was a result of that. Premeditated by walking across the stumps and bowler did the basics right, full and straight. batsman couldn't connect the sweep and once he got hit on the pad, it was always going to be out. The umpire felt so too and although the South African opted for the DRS, there was nothing on UltraEdge to save him. Three Reds on HawkEye to compound the misery and team have lost the review. Excellent innings nevertheless. batsman lbw b bowler 60(39) [4s-6 6s-2]"
7359,"out Caught by Shami!! This was coming - batsman was being tied down and he falls while trying for that big hit - picked the wrong 'un as he went down on the sweep, couldn't roll his wrists over and ended up swiping it in the air. Shami was the man running across to his right from deep backward square leg, gets himself into a good position and holds on. team are stuttering once again in the middle overs. batsman c Shami b bowler 18(22) [4s-2]"
7360,"FOUR, edged and four, another wrong 'un from Murugan, fraction short and spinning back into the right-hander, Hardik didn't pick it as he went for the cut - cramped up for room, gets a thick outside edge that brushes Rahul's gloves and runs away to the third man fence"
7361,"FOUR, cracking shot, tad too short from bowler, Hardik swivels across, rolls his wrists and finds the gap between the two men in the deep, much needed boundary for the Mumbai Indians"
7362,"out Caught by Agarwal!! That's a high catch and Mayank has judged it to perfection at long-off. 'This went to the moon and came back' chirps Danny Morrison on air. batsman got this one very high and it took an age to come down - but it looked like it didn't have enough legs to clear the fielder, Mayank was the man under it, he held his cool, waited for the ball to arrive and pouched it with both hands. The knuckle ball and batsman didn't spot, was way too early on the lofted drive - plenty of height but not the distance. batsman c Agarwal b bowler 7(9)"
7363,"FOUR, Oh dear! That's extremely poor from Shami - ran across from deep backward square leg, got close to the ball and then let it for the other fielder - in the end, both are nowhere close to the ball and it costs them a couple of extra runs, short and at the stumps, pulled away past square leg"
7364,"FOUR, back-to-back boundaries for Krunal, he's getting a move on, length delivery outside off, Krunal delayed his drive by a moment and then placed it wide of extra-cover - no one in the deep and the ball ran away to the fence"
7365,"out Caught by Murugan Ashwin!! That's a good wicket at this stage of the innings - Krunal was opening up, but bowler has his man. Short and angling down the leg-side, Krunal was looking to help it on its way with the shovel - didn't get hold of the shot and popped it in the air over square leg. Murugan Ashwin ran across to his left from the deep and completed the catch with soft hands. batsman c Murugan Ashwin b bowler 10(5) [4s-2]"
7366,"FOUR, short, wide and four, Hardik has plenty of width on offer as he scythes this one past point, no need to run for those"
7367,"SIX, and this is why - another full-toss and it has been sent into the mid-wicket stands, presses across and then whips it with the bottom-hand, high and long into the crowd - bowler can't bowl such stuff at this stage of the innings"
7368,"out Caught by Mandeep!! That's the end of Hardik, but he has played another fine hand for his team. Short and just outside off, he got into a good position on the pull, but doesn't get hold of the shot. Went high and straight into the hands of mandeep - who was standing in front of the ropes at mid-wicket. Hardik has his bat on his shoulder as he walks away in disappointment. batsman c Mandeep b bowler 31(19) [4s-3 6s-1]"
7369,"FOUR, just over a leaping Viljoen! Nervy moment for batsman who went for the slog sweep and it wasn't that far away from backward square leg where Viljoen leapt with all his might, only to clear him en route to the fence"
7370,"FOUR, up and over! Might have been the slower ball from bowler but it's was quite wide and that allowed batsman to extend his arms. Didn't connect the loft perfectly but had enough to clear the infield"
7371,"FOUR, genius stuff from batsman! Was giving the charge and then got a slower ball in response, quite shorter too but the team skipper adjusted with an elegant back foot punch through backward point. Style, grace and placement all ticked"
7372,"FOUR, more runs! batsman is shifting gears now. This was a touch too straight in line and he just shuffled across to help this away past short fine leg"
7373,"out Lbw!! Massive strike from bowler! batsman was looking ominous and if team needed him gone, it was right here right now and that's exactly what the South African has done. Must say it wasn't a great shot from the team skipper, stood rooted on the crease to an extremely full in-angler, attempted to just slog across the line, only to get struck on the back leg. Looked plumb in real time itself unless there was an inside edge but there wasn't. batsman lbw b bowler 32(18) [4s-5]"
7374,"FOUR, deft touch from Yadav! Too straight in line from bowler and it's clipped softly wide of short fine leg"
7375,"FOUR, ominous! Whoa, the bloke is looking in sync from ball one. Got forward to this fuller one and just eased it past the bowler. Just a mere push and such was the timing that it raced away, beating mid-on comfortably"
7376,"out Lbw!! The other Ashwin gets into the act! Just two balls to take the wicket and it's another vital one as Yadav can be dangerous. This was slider and kept a trifle low perhaps as he tried to whip-pull across the line. Once he missed it, there was no doubt on the LBW. As plumb as it gets and Yadav knew it too as he continued the walk to the dugout. batsman lbw b bowler 11(6) [4s-2]"
7377,"FOUR, too close to cut! batsman pulls it off though and gets it away very fine, beating short third man to the fence. 1000 IPL runs up for QDK!"
7378,"FOUR, bulldozed away! Came down the track and Ashwin adjusted with a shorter one wider outside off, flat-batted powerfully straight down the ground. Long-on was wider and had no chance"
7379,"FOUR, to the other side of long-on this time. Was floated up fuller outside off and batsman whipped it away with that strong bottom hand of his. Power and precision in placement as he got it between long-on and deep mid-wicket"
7380,"SIX, dumped into the crowd! Fractionally short from bowler and it's not that high to threaten batsman either. The South African swivels across to shovel the pull high and handsome over deep backward square leg. Huge hit!"
7381,"FOUR, boundary to end the over. The short of length delivery sits up on the surface, Shaw had plenty of time to swivel and nail the pull in front of square, no chance for Ferguson this time"
7382,"FOUR, whippage! bowler tries the slower delivery but offers a half volley on middle and leg, Shaw leans forward and whips it with a lot of bottom hand to deep mid-wicket"
7383,"SIX, proper drag down - as bad as it can get. And it's the googly as well in it, giving Iyer all the more time to read it better - not that he needed it - but then he waits slogging it several rows into deep square leg"
7384,"SIX, now the advance, stepping away from the line to free up his hands. And his hands take it inside-out over long-on"
7385,"FOUR, quickly on a knee, and to his credit doesn't try getting under the already-full length. Instead settles to sweep, and does it straight down the ground"
7386,"FOUR, juicy overcook - oh no it's a full toss - and Shaw has half a helicopter and half a flamingo. So he Dhoni-Pietersen's it through cow corner. Go, figure .."
7387,"FOUR, there's insult. And then there's this. Firstly Russell's bowling because he has to, and then he's been carted around, and to top it all, the one chance he creates it put down so damn casually. Iyer whips uppishly, doesn't get the distance, straight to Gill, who just lets it spill through"
7388,"FOUR, full, outside off, Iyer slices hard, drilling it in fact through extra cover. More insult .. an injured soul to top an injured shoulder"
7389,"out Caught by Shubman Gill!! Catching confusion. Gill - in redemption - has done a Dinesh Karthik, plucking pretty much one he would've been forgiven for putting down after dropping one he couldn't have been forgiven for. Iyer whips again, airily, Gill, at cow corner's boundary goes reverse cupped right at the edge over his head. But, but, is his foot touching the cushions? The umpires aren't taking a chance, they go up. And gee, this is really tight. The soft signal wins - OUT. batsman c Shubman Gill b bowler 43(32) [4s-4 6s-2]"
7390,"FOUR, quick, short, outside off. Never mind it spinning back in, Shaw's already deep enough in the crease and very cheekily dabbing it off the keeper's gloves"
7391,"FOUR, it's getting predictable. 97.8kph here, which batsman first presses forward to and then piles on the line already on the pads to help - with a lot of power in his whack of course - behind square"
7392,"FOUR, sitter googly. Shaw sits over it, no sorry stands over it, and slaps it away hard, and doesn't even bother keeping it down as he goes over cover"
7393,"FOUR, threatens with the bouncer, but Shaw's not not taking it on. He's waiting deep in the crease just for it and swivels in his hook to put it away very fine"
7394,"FOUR, short again. Shaw goes 180-degrees the other way now .. makes room and upper-cuts, over short third man"
7395,"FOUR, oh he wants a century. And Krishna surely is helping him to it. An overtly friendly drifter down leg, Shaw stays his ground, picks and dispatches it off his legs past the diving keeper"
7396,"FOUR, and he has the time to rub in some grace as well into this carnage. The full-faced punch down the pitch, which should ideally have been just a couple, but Russell just doesn't dive. Poor guy, he just can't"
7397,"out Caught by Chawla!! Miss. Miss. Connect. And when he does, it picks out the man in the deep. batsman refuses to ditch his failed slog sweep from a ball earlier, goes through but Kuldeep very smartly has dragged his length back on this one, making batsman eventually go one-handed in his followthrough. Miscued severely, to deep mid-wicket. batsman c Chawla b bowler 11(15) [4s-1]"
7398,"out Caught by Karthik!! Kotla heartbreak. A quicker bumper, Shaw can't resist, but for once doesn't find his bat's middle. Big fat top-edge, ballooning high, where DK calls, and nearly makes a mess under the skier, eventually having to take his tummy's help in holding on. So Shaw may have missed out on becoming the youngest IPL centurion, but he becomes the second in these 12 seasons to get out on 99. It's all about getting into trivia books after all, right?! batsman c Karthik b bowler 99(55) [4s-12 6s-3]"
7399,"FOUR, short, angling across. But batsman goes almost as deep as his stumps and waits for the slant to get big as he pulls it away, splitting the massive leg-sided gap perfectly"
7400,"out Caught by Shubman Gill!! It will twist, ever so slowly, but it will twist. Short, skiddy, heaved, and it's straight down deep mid-wicket's throat. The favourites have turned, clearly. batsman c Shubman Gill b bowler 2(3)"
7401,"FOUR, batsman has his first boundary. Delhi need him to fire and fire quickly. Picks the fullish length and just lofts through the line, clears mid-on quite comfortably"
7402,"FOUR, up and over. This is good intent from batsman. Shimmies down the wicket and gets a bit too close to the delivery, but still goes through with the loft and clears a leaping Russell near the mid-off ring"
7403,"SIX, now follows it up with a maximum. This is batsman at his best. Googly around leg-stump, that is easy pickings for the left hander, kneels down and sweeps it with a clean bat swing over long leg"
7404,"out Caught by A Russell!! Gone! One shot too many from the southpaw. team have got their early wicket. He cleared mid-off a couple of deliveries ago but not this time. He advances and once more gets very close to the ball, spoons the loft straight into the bucket hands of Russell at mid-off. batsman c A Russell b bowler 16(8) [4s-2 6s-1]"
7405,"out batsman Run Out!! 1 run completed. Swipes behind square. And he runs. He HAS TO. Beats short fine leg. But all his desperation is good enough for a single. Uthappa swooped in there, and capped it with a flat throw at the striker's. And DK turns the lights up .. SUPER OVER. Oh Kolkata have stolen this, right under Delhi's nose. batsman run out (Uthappa/Karthik) 10(7) [4s-1]"
7406,"FOUR, overpitched and Shaw does not miss out, he stays leg-side of the ball and lifts it over mid-off. Just managed to clear Ferguson on the edge of the 30-yard circle"
7407,"SIX, cracking shot! Shaw picked the length so quickly there, it was fraction short and he was onto it in a flash, gets into a good position and nails the pull flat into the crowd at deep mid-wicket"
7408,"FOUR, he connects and that should be a relief. Floated up outside off and that was in the slot for Iyer, who free his arms and smashes it straight back over his partner"
7409,"SIX, in the air and over the rope. Seemed like a mishit by Shaw but it carried a good fair distance. Flighted outside off and Shaw lofts it down the ground, clearing long-off. 13 off the over and it was much needed for Delhi"
7410,"SIX, conventional, leg-lined, but Iyer's smarter. Clears his forward leg, steps away too and then swings. Into long-on's first floor"
7411,"FOUR, too short. And that fiendly short. Iyer jumps, doesn't mind pulling it with an air-swivel, powerfully through mid-wicket"
7412,"FOUR, bowler almost strikes on his first ball, almost! Pitches this one up around the off-stump line, batsman looks to defend this and ends up getting an inside edge. The ball whizzes past the leg stump and races away to the fine leg fence. Lucky start!"
7413,"FOUR, excellent timing! Another delivery pitched on a full length by KG, batsman leans forward and just play a gentle push. Timing is good enough to beat the fielder at wide mid-off as the ball rockets to the fence, two boundaries in the over so far.."
7414,"no run, Delhi have taken a review in the second over of the match itself. They've challenged the umpire's call. Has batsman edged this? Rishabh Pant was excited but there's clear daylight between the bat and ball. Delhi lose their review! Was a quicker legbreak outside off and the batsman was looking to steer it to third man before he got beaten on his bottom edge"
7415,"SIX, 100 runs for Russell in the league after this six! Was a tossed up delivery around off and the Dre Russ muscles it over long-off for a flat six"
7416,"FOUR, batsman brings out his sledge hammer! Treks back and clobbers it through mid-wicket. Sheer power and the placement was perfect too"
7417,"SIX, Muscle-Russell in the house! Reads the googly and pumps it over deep mid-wicket with all his might. There was a fielder in the deep but he was a mere spectator"
7418,"SIX, is this going to be another one of those nights? If Dre Russ stays out there, it probably might. Down on his knee as he clubs the juicy legbreak right over the bowler's head. That was absolutely launched by the beast"
7419,"FOUR, classic batsman! Takes a forward stride and flicks this one effortlessly through mid-wicket. All about timing, yet again. Not for the first time has DK timed it so well, have been quite a few in this innings so far"
7420,"FOUR, uhhh! That was streaky but team won't mind it. Low full toss close to the yorker range, Russell bends down to try and squeeze it out, the under edge bounces past the stumps and races to the fine leg fence"
7421,"leg byes, FOUR, loses his radar does Morris. Tries to follow Russell and cramp him for room, but sprays it too far down leg, the ball takes a deflection off the pad and beats Pant to his left"
7422,"SIX, straight over the sightscreen. Morris goes off-pace but the length is right in the slot, Russell spotted it out of the hand, waited for the ball to arrive and smacked it with all that Caribbean power back over Morris"
7423,"FOUR, power from one end and finesse from the other - perfect combination. A low full toss outside off, batsman just had to put it in the gap, he leans forward and creams the drive through extra cover - splitting the two fielders"
7424,"SIX, massive! This one hits the roof of the top tier and falls back into the ground. Length and that is one thing you can't bowl to Russell, he just uses that raw muscle power to club it over long-on"
7425,"SIX, oh geez! Absolute carnage at Kotla. How things turnaround in T20 cricket. Just a while back team looked down but now they are bossing this game through Russell and Karthik. Another length ball and Russell says thank you very much and puts it into the crowd near the cow corner region"
7426,"FOUR, fifty for Russell. This might be a very typical Russell innings but the circumstances were different as compared to the previous two outings. Came in to bat inside the 10th over and has bailed his side out of trouble. Dug in short and Russell is waiting for it, nails the pull wide of deep mid-wicket"
7427,"FOUR, even fours matter for Russell. It is not only about sixes. A few inches short of yorker length and that is enough for Russell to go through with his heave, one bounce and over the ropes near deep mid-wicket"
7428,"FOUR, this is top top batting. Fires the yorker from round the wicket but Russell is up for it, he makes room and bends down to squeeze it past backward point, the pace of Morris took care of the rest"
7429,"out Caught by (sub)Rahul Tewatia!! A collision between the fielders but more importantly the catch is taken. A brutal innings from Russell comes to an end. He's put his side in the ascendancy here. The slower short of length delivery and Russell was a tad early into the pull shot, the top-edge flew up towards deep square leg and Tewatia ran in to catch it. Rabada was the one who collided as he ran back from short fine with his eyes on the ball. batsman c (sub)Rahul Tewatia b bowler 62(28) [4s-4 6s-6]"
7430,"SIX, that is dismissive from batsman. Off the mark with a maximum. Wrong 'un and batsman picked it, went down on his knee and slog swept it with a clean bat swing over long leg"
7431,"SIX, fifty for batsman. Cometh the hour, cometh the captain. This is what responsibility has done to DK. He is a completely different batsman and this knock should rate among his best. Shuffles across, bends down and sweeps it high and into the stands at fine leg"
7432,"out Caught by Pant!! He walks! Some respite for bowler, who has taken a beating in this over. This would have been a wide had batsman let go but instead he goes chasing after it. The leg-break trying to keep it away from the batsman's range, but DK reaches out and feathers an outside edge to Pant. He does not even wait for the umpire to raise his finger. batsman c Pant b bowler 50(36) [4s-5 6s-2]"
7433,"FOUR, poor bowling from bowler. He misses the yorker and bowls a juicy full toss outside off, Kuldeep uses the pace and steers it to third man, no one there to stop the boundary"
7434,"FOUR, all these are bonus runs. Banged in short and aimed for the badge on the helmet, batsman pulls and the top-edge runs away fine beating Patel near the fine leg fence"
7435,"out batsman Run Out!! 1 run completed. Confusion and it results in a run out. batsman mistimes the loft towards long-on and he was never interested in the second, Kuldeep pushed for it and batsman decided to go, but the batsmen didn't cross each other when bowler removed the bails which means batsman was the one to be dismissed. batsman run out (Dhawan/bowler) 12(5) [4s-1 6s-1]"
7436,out Lbw!! batsman's struggle comes to an end. Walks back after consuming 16 deliveries for his 7. Scored a boundary that too off an inside edge. Hard luck. Was the wrong 'un around middle and the batsman got beaten due to the googly. Struck in front of middle and going on to hit the leg-stump. Lamichanne makes an impact in his first game of the season. batsman lbw b bowler 7(16) [4s-1]
7437,"FOUR, off the mark with a boundary! Scored a fifty in the last match too. Plants his front foot forward and creams the legbreak through the gap at covers. The outfield is quick enough to get him off the mark with four runs"
7438,"FOUR, clean strike! Width on offer on this length delivery and batsman chips it over wide mid-off. Clears the infield comfortably and gets his second boundary of the match"
7439,"FOUR, hacked down to fine leg by batsman! On the shorter side around middle and leg, Chris swivels and puts it away to the fine leg fence for another boundary"
7440,"FOUR, that shot proves how good a form batsman is in. Was a shortish delivery outside off, Robbie makes the width on offer and chops it past the fielder at point"
7441,"out Lbw!! That's P.L.U.M.B! If that's not out, nothing else can be. Patel outfoxes Robbie with the off-cutter. He was looking to flick across the line but he gets beaten due to the lack of pace. Struck in front of middle and it would have crashed into middle and leg. Middle, probably. No reviews left and even if there was one, it wouldn't have made a difference. batsman lbw b bowler 11(6) [4s-2]"
7442,"out Caught by Pant!! That's a terrific catch by Pant. Is there anything, he can't do? Flies to his left and plucks this one with his left glove. Knight Riders in trouble with three of their top-order batsmen back to the hut. A short delivery down the leg side and batsman gets a glove as he looks to play the pull shot. The run rate is well under 6 at the moment. Can they stitch in a partnership? batsman c Pant b bowler 20(18) [4s-3]"
7443,"FOUR, intent from the skipper! Wastes no time. Gets a half-volley on the pads and DK flicks it with nonchalance. The timing was such that the fielder had deep mid-wicket could nothing else than admire the shot"
7444,out Caught by Rabada!! Wickets continue to tumble at the Kotla. team struggling big time in their first away game of the season. Patel bags his second wicket! This was a back of a length delivery down the leg side and batsman flicks it straight to fine leg. The ball flew of the blade and Rabada in the deep took a well judged catch running to his right. 44/4 stands the score. The crowd at Delhi is lovin' it. batsman c Rabada b bowler 1(2)
7445,"SIX, 50 up for team with a maximum! Too hot, too cool. A short delivery down the leg side and batsman picks it up over deep backward square leg for a flat six. Right over the opposition's dug-out she goes"
7446,"FOUR, that's a lucky boundary for team! Was the slider outside off, DK goes for a cut and gets an underedge. Nutmegs the keeper and races away to third man fence. There were two fielders chasing but both were inside the circle, hence there was no chance of stopping this"
7447,"out batsman Run Out!! 2 runs completed. team sink further! Not their day, perhaps. All credit to Rabada though, he dived full stretch to his left after he sprinted across from sweeper cover. Gill had square driven it through point and was expecting a boundary but is denied that due to some brilliance it the field. KG had parried the ball to Patel in the deep and the throw came in at the bowler's end. The batsman was ball watching while going for the third run and has to pay the price for it. batsman run out (Harshal Patel/bowler) 4(5)"
7448,"FOUR, lovely, on a good length and well outside off, Parthiv leans into the drive, plays it on the up and finds the gap to the left of cover - no need to run for those"
7449,"FOUR, cracking shot, fraction too short from bowler, Parthiv is quick to pick the length early, rocks back and pulls it over mid-wicket for a boundary"
7450,"SIX, knuckle ball from Kaul, Grandhomme picks it early and waits back to heave it over deep square leg. Didn't come off the middle but enough to clear the fielder's head"
7451,"SIX, rare loose delivery from Rashid and Grandhomme comfortably smokes it over the fence at deep mid-wicket. Dragged it short, sits up superbly for Grandhomme and he takes toll.."
7452,"FOUR, Grandhomme shows some deftness. Uses the pace of this delivery, goes deep in his crease and guides it past backward point. Cleverly done"
7453,"FOUR, well-directed short ball from Kumar but Barman manages to help it over the keeper. Gets himself into a tangle as he was late on the pull, however gets some glove on it and it purrs away to the fine leg fence"
7454,"FOUR, Kumar continues to struggle with his lines. Attempted pitched up delivery, ends up in the slot for Grandhomme who makes merry. Hoicking it over wide long-on"
7455,"FOUR, that's hit uppishly and Manish Pandey at long-off tries his best diving to his left but it eludes him. Floater outside off, Grandhomme plants his front foot across and lofts it towards long-off and luckily gets away as Manish's outstretched lefthand was far enough"
7456,"no run, leading edge lands short of Bhuvi at point. And there's some confusion in the running but Barman gets back in safely at the non-striker's end. Lures Grandhomme into playing an across-the-line-heave, loses shape as the ball sharply turns away and it drops a couple of inches in front of team's captain"
7457,"FOUR, 50-partnership comes up with this boundary. Short ball that lacks pace, Barman gets into a wonderful position and connects the pull sublimely over square leg"
7458,"out Caught by Hooda!! bowler foxes the young Barman with a knuckle ball but he's showed his skills with the bat. It was full and Barman was early into the shot, ends up chipping it Hooda at short mid-wicket, who takes the sitter. The spirited partnership has been broken and team have lost their seventh wicket. batsman c Hooda b bowler 19(24) [4s-2]"
7459,"SIX, you can't keep bowling knuckle balls every now and then. This was right in the arc for Umesh, who swings his bat and muscles it into the second tier at long-on"
7460,"FOUR, drilled wide of mid-off. bowler overpitches outside off, Umesh loads up and bottom-hands the drive in the gap between extra cover and mid-off"
7461,"no run. Bairstow appeals but umpire S Ravi signals it a wide. The wicket-keeper has a word with his bowler and the captain, off they go for a review. Nothing wrong with the front foot and there's a certain deflection but I think it's come off the trousers. Clearly missed the bat and it's a smart review from team because S Ravi changes his decision about the wide and it's deemed a legitimate delivery. Full and nipping down leg, Umesh lines up for the swipe and it brushes his trousers on the way to the keeper"
7462,"out U Yadav Run Out!! 1 run completed. This is suicidal. Chipped away towards sweeper cover and Grandhomme wanted the second. Just went through without looking at his partner who was busy ball-watching. They stumbled mid-pitch and Umesh eventually paid the price. Vijay Shankar fires a clean throw to Rashid, who waits before dislodging the bails. Umesh was not even in the frame and this sums up team's day. U Yadav run out (Shankar/bowler) 14(9) [4s-1 6s-1]"
7463,"1 run, Bhuvi drops a straightforward catch at extra cover but team won't mind match. Williamson and Co. are in all smiles at the dug-out. Hammered airly, went straight to Bhuvi, who mistimed his jump and ended up shelling it"
7464,"no ball, out de Grandhomme Run Out!! Low full toss outside off, batsman drives it to extra cover and went for the single. Grandhomme took a few yards before backing out. Both batsmen tries to return back to the crease and the throw from the fielder comes to the non striker's end. The Kiwi all-round was pretty lazy in grounding his bat and bowler breaks the stumps to catch him short of his crease. There was also another run-out chance at the striker's end as batsman was struggling to make his ground. bowler lasers the throw to Bairstow, who ends up crashing into the stumps. Total confusion there. Phew! de Grandhomme run out (Bhuvneshwar/bowler) 37(32) [4s-3 6s-2]"
7465,"1 run, anti-climax. Nabi puts down a tough chance at long-off. batsman miscues the pull and Nabi comes charging in from long-off, bends forward and gets both hands but fails to hold onto it"
7466,"out Caught by Hooda!! End of team's misery. batsman surrenders. Short delivery, too pacy and batsman went for the pull, launches it into the night sky as far as mid-wicket. Hooda cups it easily and that's the game in the bag for team. batsman c Hooda b bowler 1(3)"
7467,"out Caught by Manish Pandey!! That's a gift from Parthiv and Manish takes it with glee - a low full-toss from bowler, Parthiv backed away as he looked to clear the infield - doesn't get hold of the shot and pops it straight to cover. Not the start team wanted - their little pocket dynamo falls early. batsman c Manish Pandey b bowler 11(8) [4s-2]"
7468,"SIX, clubbed, batsman comes with a reputation and he gets his first six of the IPL - back of a length and just outside off, he clears his left leg and hammers it high and over mid-wicket for a maximum"
7469,"out Stumped!! One shot too many and bowler has two-in-two. He's on a hat-trick now. Gave his intentions away quite early, came charging down the pitch, allowed bowler to shorten his length - once past the swinging blade of batsman, there was no coming back. Quick work from Bairstow and batsman is well short of his ground. batsman st Bairstow b bowler 9(9) [6s-1]"
7470,"out Bowled!! bowler is running through team single-handedly - the dangerous AB falls and the Banglaore franchise are in a mess. Lovely loopy delivery on off, dragged AB forward as he looked to go inside out over cover, the ball drifted away and then dipped past the outside edge - clatters into the stumps and that's the end of AB - End of team? Think so. batsman b bowler 1(2)"
7471,"byes, FOUR, a rare botch-up from Bairstow tonight - he has missed a simple stumping chance. Moeen rushed down the track, swung in hope against the ball kept slanting in, past the inside edge and past the gloves of the keeper"
7472,"out Caught by Warner!! If it wasn't over, it's definitely over now. batsman falls and team are staring at humiliation. Length ball and it was there to be smacked - batsman leant into the drive and drilled it towards cover - didn't bother to keep it down - straight into the hands of Warner who made it look easy - a head-high catch and he clasps it with ease. The misery continues for team. batsman c Warner b bowler 3(10)"
7473,"out Moeen Ali Run Out!! Make it five down now. I'm pretty sure that Moeen is short of his ground, his bat is in the air and he already looks downcast. Well short, Moeen is OUT. Oh dear, team are batting and now running like senseless chickens. On a good length and just outside off, Dube clipped it towards mid-wicket and took a start, that prompted Moeen Ali to make a dash, sent back late - too late though - Nabi shies and misses, sandeep has time to break the stumps with the batsman well short. Moeen Ali run out (Nabi/bowler) 2(8)"
7474,"FOUR, cracking shot, width on offer and Dube gets on top of it with the cut - behind square on the off-side and races away to the ropes"
7475,"out Caught by Hooda!! It's getting worse and worse for team. bowler is having a dream spell as he picks up his fourth wicket. Dube had a chance to prove his mettle but he just miscues one into the hands of long-on. Nothing shot really and the nightmare continues for the visitors. It was flighted just outside off and kind of held up on the pitch, Dube was deluded by the flight as he went after it and could only succeed in finding Hooda. batsman c Hooda b bowler 5(7) [4s-1]"
7476,"FOUR, team are away in a fine fashion. He takes a huge stride forward. Comes close to the ball and sweeps it like a boss. It goes over backward square leg and thuds into the fence"
7477,"FOUR, offie or no offie. batsman is not concerned at all. He is in brilliant form and look how easily he lofts it over cover. Mind you it is one of the most difficult shots in our game. He backs away, makes room and dispatches it over cover for a boundary"
7478,"FOUR, third boundary of the over. And team are off to a flyer. There was room on this delivery, batsman stays put in the crease and cuts it past backward point for a boundary. Excellent placement!"
7479,"SIX, this is batting of the highest quality from batsman. It was an overpitched delivery on the stumps, batsman is not shy to hit the first ball of Yadav's spell. He clears his front leg and larrups it straight down the ground for a sensational six"
7480,"SIX, has he got enough bat on it? Yes, he has. Nothing is going right for team. It was a full-toss on the stumps, batsman stays put in the crease and clobbers it over long-on for a flat six. It was inches over Hetmyer at long-on who leaps in the air but fails to reach it"
7481,"FOUR, this is sheer carnage from Jonny and Warner. It was a back of a length delivery on the body, batsman pulls it brilliantly wide of deep square leg for a boundary"
7482,"SIX, wow! Just wow! Outstanding hitting this is from batsman. He backs away, clears his frong leg and disaptches it over long-on for another six"
7483,"FOUR, gee! Look at the bat speed on that speed. It came at around 140 kph and was dispatched by Jonny even quicker. On a fuller length and on the stumps, batsman smashes it wide of mid-off for another boundary"
7484,"2 runs, his comeback has been like a dream for team. He has been out of competitive cricket for one-year but that hasn't made an iota of difference to his batting prowess. His third fifty of this IPL season in that many matches. It was a fuller length delivery on the stumps and he pushes it to long-on for a brace"
7485,"SIX, oh no Jonny show some mercy on the 16-year-old. He dashes down the ground, takes it on the full and clobbers it over deep mid-wicket with utmost ease for a maximum"
7486,"SIX, lovely, it's raining fours and sixes at the moment, fraction short and at the stumps, batsman rocks back and pulls it flat and hard - went sailing over wide long-on for a maximum"
7487,"FOUR, thumped, no mercy for the team bowlers, flighted delivery on off, batsman gets a big stride forward and drills it wide of mid-wicket, no chance for the fielder in the deep"
7488,"2 runs, maiden IPL hundred for batsman - and look at the celebrations, this means a lot for him, punches in delight, removes his helmet and lifts both arms towards the dug-out - the Hyderabad crowd has certainly enjoyed it. Coming to the ball, it was tossed up on the leg-stump line, he got close to the ball and whipped it wide of long-on for a brace"
7489,"SIX, massive, a little shimmy, batsman gets close to the ball and lifts it nonchalantly - wide of long-on for a maximum"
7490,"FOUR, that's a poor ball, flighted and drifting down leg, batsman backs away and then heaves it over backward square leg for a boundary"
7491,"SIX, smashed, what more can team do? Even muscled mishits are sailing into the stands, a back of a length delivery outside off, batsman stood firm and then clubbed it over long-on - makes the boundaries look so short. batsman on fire, team look down and out at the moment"
7492,"out Caught by U Yadav!! There's the wicket for team - ends an outstanding knock from batsman. It's not a no-ball, so bowler can relax, the leg-break, slower and turning away from off, batsman was down on his knees as he hoicked, gets a thick top-edge, it looped in the air and looked like was falling short of backward point. Umesh charged in athletically, dived forward with both hands and holds on. A standing ovation as batsman walks away. batsman c U Yadav b bowler 114(56) [4s-12 6s-7]"
7493,"SIX, .. and batsman needs just one ball to continue team's torment, flighted delivery at the stumps, he leans forward and smashes it high and over long-on for a maximum"
7494,"SIX, that's straight into the team dug-out, the yorker strategy lasted one ball, bowler drops this one an inch short, allows batsman to get under it and thump it over Hetmyer's head at long-off"
7495,"out Shankar Run Out!! 1 run completed. Has Vijay Shankar run himself out? Has the dive saved him, NO - he's well short and team have a second wicket. batsman got lucky, but his partner wasn't. bowler followed batsman as he backed away, induced a thick outside edge on the heave - was in the air for a long time, but dropped right in between AB - who was running back from cover and Hetmyer - running in from long-off. Shankar wanted the second run, but didn't spot that his partner wasn't coming back - stranded in the middle, he made a dash towards his end, put in the dive, but all in vain. Shankar run out (Hetmyer/Parthiv Patel) 9(3) [6s-1]"
7496,"FOUR, cheeky and four, low full-toss from Umesh, was trying to follow batsman as he made room - he waits on it, opens the face of the bat at the last moment and runs it behind square on the off-side for a boundary"
7497,"SIX, this is a poor ball from Umesh, slower ball, but the length was short and just sat-up to be smacked - pulled with disdain and pulled over long leg for a maximum"
7498,"FOUR, hundred for batsman and another team batsman is thrilled to bits - rushes half-way towards the team dressing room, delight on his face as he punches his fist - raises his bat and acknowledges the applause from the Orange Army - full-toss and it was squeezed behind square on the off-side. Backward point dived, but to no avail"
7499,"FOUR, smashed. He is playing with the mind of the bowler. This time backs away, makes room for himself and cuts it past cover for a boundary. Great timing and equally good placement"
7500,"FOUR, that's an old-fashioned heave from batsman. He gets behind that back of a length delivery and tonks it wide of deep mid-wicket for a boundary."
7501,"FOUR, that's edged and four. They are dealing in boundaries here. It was short and there was width, batsman throws his hands at it. It comes off the outside half of the bat and it runs wide of third man for a boundary"
7502,"FOUR, 50-run-partnership comes up between this pair. They have been the best opening pair in this season's IPL so far. It wasn't that short and there was hardly any room. But batsman backs away creates his own room and cuts it wide of backward point for a boundary. He is a magician in that area of the ground"
7503,"FOUR, oh Jonny, you are clearing the fields with mishits too. It was a slower one, batsman wanted to loft it down the ground, his timing was in a mess. But he gets just about enough bat on it to clear mid-off and it races to the fence"
7504,"FOUR, don't bowl short to batsman. You just't can't, bowler. It was short and was wide of off, batsman cuts it formidably well, beats point and cover and it races to the fence in a canter"
7505,"SIX, that is a comprehensive hit from batsman. And he has deposited it a long way back. It was fuller and was wide of off, batsman larrups it over deep cover for a maximum"
7506,"FOUR, this is an ordinary effort from Siraj at long-on. And he gifts a boundary to batsman. It was on the pads and batsman flicks it wide of long-on. Siraj at long-on was clumsy in the deep and he lets it through"
7507,"FOUR, maiden fifty for batsman in the IPL. Brilliant innings from the Englishman. He is giving a taste of IPL cricket to the young man now. It was on the stumps and batsman paddles it fine of fine leg for a boundary. Sweet timing!"
7508,"SIX, that was a miserable delivery and batsman has given it the treamtment it deserved. It was a slower one on a short of length, batsman goes on the back foot and pulls it over deep mid-wicket for a massive six"
7509,"SIX, back-to-back sixes for batsman. It's raining sixes here in Hyderabad. It was a good length delivery on the stumps, batsman clears his front leg, keeps his shape and tonks it deep into the mid-wicket stands for a six"
7510,"SIX, flush in the slot, and batsman's V is always smoke-worthy. He gets his front leg out of the way, makes room and slogs it high and long into cow corner"
7511,"FOUR, 125.5kph. Juicy stuff sit up on the legs, and batsman's just too good to miss out on all this. He swivels, swats hard and nails the backward square leg gap"
7512,"FOUR, 130kph. Just too straight, and this in no way is helping Rajasthan's cause here. batsman won't complain though, surely not with fine leg in the circle, tickling it fine"
7513,"FOUR, that's how you deal with the slower balls. A short of length delivery from round the wicket, batsman dances down the track and smashes it over Raina's head. One bounce and into the long-on fence. All power!"
7514,"no run, a direct hit there would have been curtains for batsman. The southpaw shuffled across and tucked this length ball to short fine and set off for a quick single. Dhoni wasn't interested and sent him back. Kulkarni had all three stumps to aim, but missed the target at the striker's end"
7515,"out Bowled!! The partnership has been broken. bowler yells out a loud roar. Change of pace does the trick. Fullish ball at 116.5kph, batsman backed away a long way and exposed all his stumps. The southpaw didn't pick the slower one and wafted his bat at it, probably looking to go over the covers. Connected with thin air and the ball smashed into the sticks. batsman b bowler 36(32) [4s-4 6s-1]"
7516,"1 run, 132kph, batsman dances down the ground and batters it to the right of extra cover. It travelled quickly to Gowtham and he failed to hold onto it. Would be very harsh to call it a drop"
7517,"FOUR, bowler shortens his length, Bravo waits for it from the crease and uses his wrists to elevate it over extra cover. Didn't quite middle it, but had enough to get it over Gowtham"
7518,"FOUR, 137.1kph, full and outside off - you can't be bowling there to this guy. He plays one of his favourite shots. Throws his blade with an opened bat-face and sends it over backward point. 11 off the over"
7519,"FOUR, superb placement! Another off-pace ball from a back of a length at 109.9kph, batsman spotted that and delayed his shot from the crease. Dabbed away through the gap between short third man and backward point"
7520,"SIX, and, the skipper takes full toll of the freebie. A low full toss outside off at 132.9kph, batsman bends his back leg, gets under it and then lofts it over deep extra cover"
7521,"FOUR, 99.9kph, too slow. Bravo picked that but still was early into his shot. Gave himself some room to go over point, gets a top-edge that evades short third man to his right"
7522,"SIX, that's the trademark batsman shot! Kulkarni doles out a half-volley, right in the DJ's arc. The right-hander moves leg-side, arches his back and lofts it handsomely over deep extra cover. The maximum also brings up the fifty run stand!"
7523,"FOUR, 21st IPL fifty for batsman, and his first against team. A pacy low full toss, batsman uses the bowler's pace to drive it through the gap between backward point and short third man. The placement was spot on"
7524,out Caught by D Kulkarni!! Bravo perishes trying to play a good shot. Archer banged it in short at 132kph and Bravo went through with his pull shot despite not being in a good position to play it. The top-edge balloons up and settles into the safe hands of long-on. He went too hard and in the process lost his shape. batsman c D Kulkarni b bowler 27(16) [4s-3 6s-1]
7525,"SIX, terrific shot! It was a slower delivery, batsman deals with him like he'd treat a club bowler. Waltzes down the ground, gets to the pitch of the ball and bludgeons it over long-on for a flat six"
7526,"SIX, slower ball bouncer, sits up nicely for the right-hander and batsman deposits it into the stands. The ball doesn't rise as much as bowler would have liked it to. batsman stands tall and pulls it fiercely over deep square leg. team have crossed 160"
7527,"SIX, this is exactly what the Chennai crowd wanted. A fuller than a good length ball outside off, batsman hoists it over long-off. Set his base and then bludgeoned"
7528,"out Caught by Buttler!! 0.0.0.0.0 and batsman - injured forearm and all - can't stay patient any longer. Archer stays quick on a back of a length, but it sticks on the surface as it kicks up, making a real mess of batsman's attempted upper-steer to third man. All he gets is a thick feather on the outside edge, straight to the keeper. batsman c Buttler b bowler 1(8)"
7529,"no run, batsman reviews, and then stands in disbelief that it has to come down to this. It's a leg-line, and Buttler was probably appealing for the strangle down leg only to avoid this from being given a wide. But the umpire - Nandan - is fooled. It's clearly off the thigh pad, and the bat's not even close. Overturn"
7530,"FOUR, goes swinging. batsman isn't foxed by the short length, presses forward to it instead and pulls it away hard, over mid-wicket. Chennai have their move on .."
7531,"SIX, 28 off the over! It was another off-pace ball from a short of length, batsman waits and flat-bats it over long-on. The fielder in the deep - Tripathi - jumps in an attempt to catch it. It beats him comfortably"
7532,"SIX, gets hold. And gets it into the empty deep square leg, and then into the empty stands behind that. bowler bangs it in short, batsman - now with more of a measure of this pitch - rocks behind and pulls it yummily, uppishly. Also, there's nobody in those stands to give the ball back as well. So, get the fourth ump working .."
7533,"out Caught by Jofra Archer!! Short again. And this time batsman can't resist not poking. He goes back in the crease, goes up tall and tries half a cut, half a punch, and a full flirt after getting tied up with the zip in. Ends up with a thick outside splice, flying straight to the fine short third man placed perfectly out there. batsman c Jofra Archer b bowler 13(13) [4s-1 6s-1]"
7534,"FOUR, too short, too leg-sided. Jadhav swivels inside it and then doesn't hold back on his pull, uppishly, into fine leg"
7535,"FOUR, another bumper, another pull. Jadhav's not in control, but it doesn't matter, it's the powerplay after all. Drags it from outside off in front of square, and nothing the chase or the dive from the guy chasing it from square leg can do to stop"
7536,"FOUR, 131.3kph. Kulkarni will have to do with a moral victory. It's the bouncer, which makes batsman wait on his committed pull position, only to then take the top-edge and fly over the keeper"
7537,"out Caught by Buttler!! A wide innocuos delivery does what all the variations haven't. It's full, way outside off and Jadhav stretches out to drive. Hard. The problem though are his feet, which are stuck in the crease, just not getting close as he ends up getting a fat outside edge. And Chennai are officially on a top-order collapse. batsman c Buttler b bowler 8(3) [4s-2]"
7538,"FOUR, another drag down, and batsman makes it worse with his camp deep in the crease. And the uses the width outside off to carve it away behind point"
7539,"FOUR, when it's turning, when it's batsman, this inside-out was only a matter of time. bowler tosses it wide for a drive, but batsman goes over extra cover. Ahh, those hands"
7540,"out Caught by Jadeja!! Ideal start for the hosts. A corker from Jaddu at backward point. Another outswinger and batsman drives with hard hands. Only gets an outside edge that dips as it approached the backward point fielder. Don't think many would have taken it. But, Jadeja is one of the best fielders in world cricket. He swoops forward and takes a diving catch inches above the ground. batsman asked the fielder and decided to walk off. But, the umpires wanted to be 100% sure and hence went upstairs. Legal ball and a clean catch. A 2-ball duck for the Rajasthan skipper. batsman c Jadeja b bowler 0(2)"
7541,"FOUR, batsman is underway straightaway! Poor ball from Shardul Thakur. Ample width outside off, batsman doesn't over-hit, reaches out and cuts it through point"
7542,"out Caught&Bowled!! It's a leading edge, and taken! The cross-seamed leg-break, fired in full @90ks, full and outside off, Tripathi tries to get forward and flick it away against the spin, gets a leading edge back to the bowler who throws it right up into the humid skies in glee to see the back of Tripathi. An important partnership broken, and the aggressor, Tripathi, departs. batsman c and b bowler 39(24) [4s-5 6s-1]"
7543,"out Caught by (sub)Shorey! GONE! That's a key wicket! The leg-break, very full, batsman charges down the track, feeling the pteamRessure, and takes it on the full - tries lofting it straight into the sightscreen, but literally plays right into the hands of Shorey at the long-off boundary. bowler is thrilled to bits. He knows how important this wicket is. batsman c (sub)Shorey b bowler 28(30) [4s-2]"
7544,"SIX, fired in flat from over the wicket, angled in, batsman gets on his knee and throws the kitchen sink at it - flat-bats that over deep mid-wicket for six"
7545,"SIX, absolutely smoked! A googly on leg and middle, batsman comes down the track and swings it against the turn over cow corner for six"
7546,"out Caught by Raina! GONE! A very full one outside off, batsman, in a bid to up the ante, throws it all behind that carve over cover, ends up scooping it towards Raina at cover, who picks up yet another catch for himself. team's morale is inversely proportional to the teamR. Six down. batsman c Raina b bowler 9(8) [6s-1]"
7547,"FOUR, back of a length and wide outside off, batsman throws his hands at the cut, beats backward point to the deep backward point fence for four"
7548,"SIX, swings through the line of that half-volley and connects! Angles it in towards the leg and middle-stumps, right in the slot, batsman clears the front-leg a little and brings those massive forearms into play - goes right through the line, beautiful head position, and deposits that over the long-on fence for six"
7549,"SIX, is there a twist? 104.9km/h, a slow length ball outside off, batsman waits for it and clubs that flat over deep extra cover for six!"
7550,"FOUR, back of a length delivery angling in from round the wicket, batsman gets under it by getting across, shapes up to scoop, gets enough on it to paddle it away past Dhoni towards the fine leg boundary for four"
7551,"SIX, oh that's a poor ball. A absolute no-no at this stage, bowler takes the pace off, and batsman swings through the line, clubs it over long-on for six"
7552,"SIX, he's nailed it! Angles it in from round the wicket, batsman gets under it, gets the bottom-hand off, and gets topspin on that flat hook over backward square leg for six!"
7553,"out Caught by Raina! GONE! Let the DJ's party begin. Off he goes, on his turntable - a yorker length delivery on off, batsman tries getting under his, with the bottom-hand dominating, scoops it, gets his wrists over it, and Raina is waiting at cover - straight to him, and he holds on to yet another low catch today. A pressure catch! A key wicket, this, and this is going to be interesting. Surely, not another late-night/early-morning super-over. batsman c Raina b bowler 46(26) [4s-1 6s-3]"
7554,"out Caught by Tahir! The Yellow Army explodes! Another one @130.7km/h, on a length and angling into the body, batsman clears his leg and backs away going for a wild heave, gets a massive top-edge towards third man where Tahir gets under the pressure catch - pouches it and sets off on a celebratory run. batsman c Tahir b bowler 0(3)"
7555,"FOUR, eye-pleasing! Yes there was width on offer, but still had to be put away. On a short of length, batsman stays put in his crease and then the there's the perfect eye-hand combination. Caressed through point with a horizontal blade"
7556,"out Caught by Raina!! The centurion in the previous game is gone! A 134.1kph fullish ball outside off and batsman threw his bat at it. The bottom hand comes off the handle and hence the miscue. Raina takes a sharp catch bending forward, but batsman stands his ground. The on-field umpires send it upstairs with OUT being the soft decision. An easy one for the TV umpire as Raina had both his palms underneath the ball. batsman c Raina b bowler 8(10) [4s-1]"
7557,out Caught by Dwayne Bravo!! Rajasthan Royals lose their best batter and are in deep trouble. A fuller-than-a-good-length ball on the stumps and batsman wanted to bash it over mid-on. The ball might have held up into the wicket and that robbed the batter's timing. The bat turned at the point of impact and batsman ended up slicing it over mid-off. Bravo takes a couple of steps backwards and snaffles it with ease. batsman c Dwayne Bravo b bowler 6(7) [4s-1]
7558,"FOUR, Steven batsman gets off the mark in an emphatic fashion. Shortish ball at 132.6kph that sits up nicely for the Australian. batsman moves back and across to pull it through square leg"
7559,"FOUR, back-to-back fours. Thakur doles out a full toss. There's the customary shuffle from batsman and then he glances it neatly through square leg"
7560,"FOUR, 76.9kph, not a great start to your IPL career. A rank full toss and Tripathi's thumped it over mid-on for a boundary"
7561,"SIX, Tripathi goes downtown and the sightscreen has to take the brunt. A fullish ball at 90.6kph, Tripathi gets low and underneath it to hoist it over the bowler's end. 15 runs off 3 legal balls in this over"
7562,"no ball, FOUR, another high full toss - above-waist and Tripathi slashed his bat at it. Gets a fat outside edge that beats first slip and runs away to the third man fence"
7563,"FOUR, nicely done! bowler errs in his line. Shortish ball sprayed down leg, Tripathi stays inside the line and helps it on its way with a pull shot. Placed it fine too"
7564,"FOUR, tossed up, far too full, Tripathi leans into it and runs his hands through it to whip-drive it away towards deep extra cover for four - a top effort from Kedar at the boundary, but it beats him in the end"
7565,"1 run, banged in on a back of a length, angling into the pads, tucked off the pads towards wide long-on for a single - 50-run partnership between these two"
7566,"FOUR, flatter one outside off, Tripathi is fully to the pitch of it this time and and absolutely goes through with that mighty followthrough to loft it over the man at cover for four - inside out, and that was nailed"
7567,"FOUR, 142.9km/h, back of a length delivery angling into the hips, tucked away with fabulous timing towards the cow corner fence for four. Harshal Patel's valiant effort at the boundary in vain..."
7568,"FOUR, strays on the pads @139.7km/h, futile pace, batsman's eyes light up as he sees it's on his pads, just closes the face on the ball at the last moment to glance it away in front of deep square leg for four"
7569,"SIX, a fantastic hook! @136.2km/h, not the quickest or steepest of bumpers, batsman gets back and across, into the front-on position early, gets under the short one and swivels into a fantastic hook over fine leg for six!"
7570,"out Lbw! batsman's been given LBW! He's gone for a review straightaway! Now that the umpire has given it out, I think this is clipping leg. Just a hunch. A full delivery angling into the pads, he's missed a juicy half-volley, attempting a cross-batted flick. Pitching in line, hitting him in line, and clipping the leg-stump. Yep, I was right - not for the first time (wink) - it's the umpire's call taking a toll again as the batting side are left with the consolation prize of a retained review. batsman lbw b bowler 15(11) [4s-2 6s-1]"
7571,"FOUR, ruins the over. But it was a top shot from Sarfaraz. Speared into the blockhole and Sarfaraz almost casually squeezes the slice past the diving point fielder, the lightning fast outfield takes care of the rest"
7572,"SIX, smoked! That's twice in a row that Delhi have conceded a boundary/six off the last ball. It was turning out to be an excellent over until batsman decided to use his feet, gets to the pitch of the ball and launches it over wide long-on"
7573,"2 runs, pace off and batsman waits before clipping it wide of deep mid-wicket, easy two. That brings up the 50-run stand for the pair and they need to keep going"
7574,"FOUR, batsman has stepped on the gas now. The slower short of length delivery and he's into position quickly, swivels and places the pull with a nice wrist roll backward of square leg"
7575,"FOUR, cheeky! Normal pace delivery from Harshal but he's offered space outside off, batsman allows the ball to arrive and runs it away fine to third man. The ball raced away to the fence"
7576,"out Caught by Pant!! Gone! That is the problem with Sarfaraz. He will give you those cute little 30s and 40s but never a man for a big innings. Nothing but a leg-break with a hint of turn, Sarfaraz stays flat-footed and has a poke at it, very casual in his approach and the ball finds a feather of the outside edge. Pant does well to hold on to the catch as it almost popped out. batsman c Pant b bowler 39(29) [4s-6]"
7577,"FOUR, the extra delivery and a boundary conceded. That's what you call small margins in cricket. Misses the yorker and offers a low full toss outside off, batsman dinks it over extra cover and the timing is such that it beats long-off comfortably"
7578,"FOUR, that's a gift and batsman ain't missing out. Loopy full toss outside off, batsman does not do anything fancy, uses his power to drive it past extra cover"
7579,"out Caught by Pant!! And Morris wins the battle.. Huge wicket at this stage. batsman shuffled across and aimed to go across the line, Morris cleverly rolled his fingers across the ball, the top-edge went straight up and Pant settled under it. Punjab have kept losing wickets at the wrong time today. batsman c Pant b bowler 43(30) [4s-4 6s-2]"
7580,"FOUR, Ayappa has misjudged it horribly. Short of length and batsman pulls it to deep mid-wicket, Ayappa is late to charge in and then has to run back because the ball bounced in front of him, can only parry it over the rope"
7581,"out Caught by Chris Morris!! Punjab's innings is coming apart. bowler is just too good for batsman. Short of length and climbs up awkwardly onto the batsman, batsman tries to turn it into the leg-side but only manages a leading edge to cover. Morris completes the dolly. The umpire checks for front foot error but bowler is fine. batsman c Chris Morris b bowler 1(3)"
7582,"out Bowled!! Cleaned up! It has all gone downward in the last 20 minutes or so. Morris picks up his third. A juicy full toss and batsman could have hit it anywhere, he backs away and is beaten for pace, the ball brushes the off-stump to light it up. batsman b bowler 3(4)"
7583,"out Caught by Avesh Khan!! Collision, a pop out and taken in the end. Pant and Avesh almost made a meal of it. bowler sees the funny side of it. Ashwin wanted to heave it into the cow corner fence and the top-edge went straight up towards point, Pant ran across even as Avesh steadied himself under it, the ball hit Pant's gloves and then popped up, Avesh was the first to react and he claims the catch. batsman c Avesh Khan b bowler 1(2)"
7584,"out batsman Run Out!! batsman is made to sacrifice his wicket. Short ball at the body, batsman takes his eyes off as he aims to pull, the ball hits him on the shoulder and drops down, Mandeep races to the other end and batsman just crosses him to ensure he's out. bowler does the easy part of collecting the ball, walking back and removing one bail. batsman run out (bowler) 0(1)"
7585,"FOUR, slower short of length delivery and batsman waits for it, gets on top of the bounce and slaps it over mid-off. The fielder was inside the ring and he just had to clear him"
7586,"FOUR, Gayle who? 144.7km/h, all of it in vain because it's a half-volley outside off, batsman doesn't move his feet and plays a transfer of weight drive between extra cover and long-off for four!"
7587,"FOUR, oh this is fantastic batting! Did they drop him for his bowling? Oh well well. Looks like we have Narine 2.0. Another half-volley outside off, this time it's lofted over the infield to the deep extra cover fence for four"
7588,"FOUR, 138.1km/h, a full-blooded drive through the vacant extra cover region! A good length delivery in the zone, angling in, and not much wrong with it, batsman takes a small step forward and drives it through the line towards the deep extra cover fence for four"
7589,"SIX, batsman finishes with a maximum. bowler misses his length and bowls it right in the arc, batsman clears his front leg and smashes it straight back over. The boundaries straight are not big and it clears 'em with ease"
7590,"SIX, slows the pace down, tossed up above the eye-line, the googly, batsman spots it, hurries down the track to the pitch of it, and lofts it straight down the ground for a colossal six!"
7591,"out Lbw! Doesn't even wait to review! Angles it across after pitching in on leg and middle, straightens, does the leg-spinner, and batsman is trapped on the backfoot, trying to tuck across the line - but the whippy action and the lack of backspin means that it will hurry on and he is trapped in front. He's on his way back after an impressive cameo up top. batsman lbw b bowler 20(10) [4s-3 6s-1]"
7592,"FOUR, 148.2km/h of wasted energy as he dishes out a half-volley on the pads, and batsman gets a tasty starter, flicks it off his pads towards the backward square leg fence for four"
7593,"FOUR, good length delivery outside off, hard length, batsman runs his hands through a cover drive without any feet and caresses that with sweet timing to the sweeper cover boundary for four"
7594,"FOUR, a pacy full-toss on the pads, 142.4km/h, whipped away with utmost ease to the deep mid-wicket fence for four. All timing."
7595,"out Agarwal Run Out! Already a slower one @116.8km/h on a good length, batsman delays a transfer-of-weight punch to Dhawan, and Agarwal tries to recover after backing up, but a direct-hit from Dhawan (and a thigh slap to follow it up) with one stump to aim at, has sent Agarwal packing! Fantastic throw by Dhawan, and certainly nothing iffy about that dismissal, with team on the receiving end this time. Just a moment of brilliance. Agarwal run out (Dhawan) 6(9)"
7596,"FOUR, nothing wrong with that, a back of a length delivery @137.1km/h, batsman stays stable on the backfoot and opens the face, surgically bisects the field behind point for four"
7597,"FOUR, back of a length del - doesn't matter - batsman gets on his knee, bows his head down, and absolutely nails the scoop over the gaping 'keeper to the long stop fence for a one-bounce four"
7598,"SIX, oh he's made up for those dot balls! A fuller length delivery with a bit of width, right in the slot, batsman swings through the line and runs those massive arms through it - lofts it high and mighty into the crowd in the deep extra cover region for six! Strike-rate back at 100!"
7599,"FOUR, 142.9km/h, back of a length delivery angling into the hips, tucked away with fabulous timing towards the cow corner fence for four. Harshal Patel's valiant effort at the boundary in vain..."
7600,"FOUR, strays on the pads @139.7km/h, futile pace, batsman's eyes light up as he sees it's on his pads, just closes the face on the ball at the last moment to glance it away in front of deep square leg for four"
7601,"SIX, a fantastic hook! @136.2km/h, not the quickest or steepest of bumpers, batsman gets back and across, into the front-on position early, gets under the short one and swivels into a fantastic hook over fine leg for six!"

7618,"FOUR, Gayle who? 144.7km/h, all of it in vain because it's a half-volley outside off, batsman doesn't move his feet and plays a transfer of weight drive between extra cover and long-off for four!"
7619,"FOUR, oh this is fantastic batting! Did they drop him for his bowling? Oh well well. Looks like we have Narine 2.0. Another half-volley outside off, this time it's lofted over the infield to the deep extra cover fence for four"
7620,"FOUR, 138.1km/h, a full-blooded drive through the vacant extra cover region! A good length delivery in the zone, angling in, and not much wrong with it, batsman takes a small step forward and drives it through the line towards the deep extra cover fence for four"
7621,"SIX, batsman finishes with a maximum. bowler misses his length and bowls it right in the arc, batsman clears his front leg and smashes it straight back over. The boundaries straight are not big and it clears 'em with ease"
7622,"SIX, slows the pace down, tossed up above the eye-line, the googly, batsman spots it, hurries down the track to the pitch of it, and lofts it straight down the ground for a colossal six!"
7623,"out Lbw! Doesn't even wait to review! Angles it across after pitching in on leg and middle, straightens, does the leg-spinner, and batsman is trapped on the backfoot, trying to tuck across the line - but the whippy action and the lack of backspin means that it will hurry on and he is trapped in front. He's on his way back after an impressive cameo up top. batsman lbw b bowler 20(10) [4s-3 6s-1]"
7624,"FOUR, 148.2km/h of wasted energy as he dishes out a half-volley on the pads, and batsman gets a tasty starter, flicks it off his pads towards the backward square leg fence for four"
7625,"FOUR, good length delivery outside off, hard length, batsman runs his hands through a cover drive without any feet and caresses that with sweet timing to the sweeper cover boundary for four"
7626,"FOUR, a pacy full-toss on the pads, 142.4km/h, whipped away with utmost ease to the deep mid-wicket fence for four. All timing."
7627,"out Agarwal Run Out! Already a slower one @116.8km/h on a good length, batsman delays a transfer-of-weight punch to Dhawan, and Agarwal tries to recover after backing up, but a direct-hit from Dhawan (and a thigh slap to follow it up) with one stump to aim at, has sent Agarwal packing! Fantastic throw by Dhawan, and certainly nothing iffy about that dismissal, with team on the receiving end this time. Just a moment of brilliance. Agarwal run out (Dhawan) 6(9)"
7628,"FOUR, nothing wrong with that, a back of a length delivery @137.1km/h, batsman stays stable on the backfoot and opens the face, surgically bisects the field behind point for four"
7629,"FOUR, back of a length del - doesn't matter - batsman gets on his knee, bows his head down, and absolutely nails the scoop over the gaping 'keeper to the long stop fence for a one-bounce four"
7630,"SIX, oh he's made up for those dot balls! A fuller length delivery with a bit of width, right in the slot, batsman swings through the line and runs those massive arms through it - lofts it high and mighty into the crowd in the deep extra cover region for six! Strike-rate back at 100!"
7631,"FOUR, nicely played by batsman, fraction too short and drifting onto batsman's pads, he waits on it and then works it behind square on the on-side for a boundary"
7632,"FOUR, edged and four, on a good length and in that channel outside off, drew batsman into playing at that - pushed away from his body, the edge runs away through the vacant slip cordon"
7633,"out Caught by Buttler!! Gopal is on fire. Third wicket and all big ones. batsman's struggles in IPL continue.. team in a spot of bother now. The wrong 'un spinning across the left hander, batsman stays back and has a tentative poke at that, feathers an outside edge and Buttler does the rest behind the wicket. That is 9 wickets in 3 games now for Gopal against team. batsman c Buttler b bowler 1(9)"
7634,"SIX, just over.. bowler knows how close it was. Short of length and there was no pace on the ball, Parthiv goes for the pull and the top-edge clears a leaping Tripathi near deep backward square"
7635,"FOUR, offers pace and width, Parthiv will feed on that all day, he cracks the back cut behind point and pace on the ball meant it raced away to the fence beating third man"
7636,"SIX, exactly what batsman needed to get himself going. He takes full toll of the free-hit. Archer went off-pace but the length allowed batsman to flexes those muscles, he powers it over wide long-on. Lot of height and the much needed distance as well"
7637,"no ball, 1 run, so many things happening on one ball. Lets first acknowledge Parthiv's fifty. A fine knock on a surface where the rest have struggled. And whatsmore it is his fastest IPL fifty. Now to the rest of the ball: Archer oversteps to deliver the slower ball, dabbed to short third and Parthiv wanted a single, Stoinis sends him back and he makes it just in time as there was a direct hit, the deflection forces Stoinis to go for the run and they steal it in the end quite comfortably"
7638,"FOUR, top shot! He knows his strengths and hitting areas. Another slower length ball outside off, Parthiv uses the depth of the crease, gets underneath the ball and lofts it over extra cover handsomely"
7639,"FOUR, much needed boundary for team. Parthiv has been mistiming those pulls/heaves but not this time. He waits for the delivery to arrive and pummels it to wide long-on, couple of bounces and into the fence"
7640,"out Caught by Rahane!! Gone! But Parthiv has done more than his job. A fine knock from the 'keeper. Slower delivery at 125.4ks and Parthiv does not have the power to clear this big boundaries, he still goes through and makes a decent connection, holes out just in front of the long-on rope. batsman c Rahane b bowler 67(41) [4s-9 6s-1]"
7641,"FOUR, streaky! Spears a full delivery at 147.6ks and Mo squirts a thick inside edge through his legs, the placement is such that he splits fine leg and deep square leg perfectly"
7642,"FOUR, thumped! batsman picks the slower delivery, maintains a good base by going deep in the crease and whips it with a lot of bottom hand to wide long-on, one bounce and over the ropes"
7643,"no run, pacy short ball from bowler and batsman is a bit surprised by that, he is late on the pull/hook and the ball flies over the top-edge. Buttler went up but bowler gestured he didn't hear anything"
7644,"SIX, another six that is just over.. Archer bowls the slower delivery on short of length, Mo picked the bones out of that, he was expecting this and it was right in his arc, hammers it over a leaping deep mid-wicket fielder"
7645,"FOUR, past Gowtham's dive. Lands the slower delivery in a fullish range, Mo with a readymade clear of his front leg pumps it straight down the ground, the wet outfield makes the ball skid off the ground"
7646,"FOUR, cheeky! batsman had made up his mind even before Archer was about to bowl. He crouched low, moved across his stumps and scooped the full toss to the fine leg fence, 17 off the final over"
7647,"FOUR, nicely played - was in the air for a long time, but batsman got the placement right - took a step down the track on the flick, didn't time it all that well - but found the gap"
7648,"FOUR, lovely shot, the slower ball from Dhawal, but sprayed it onto Parthiv's pads, whipped away over short fine, couple of bounces and over the ropes - team needed some momentum and 9 came from this over"
7649,"FOUR, cheeky and four, short and just outside off, Parthiv arches back, opens the face of the bat and then runs it late - past the keeper, one bounce and over the ropes"
7650,"FOUR, back-to-back boundaries for Parthiv - not all that convincing, but he will take the runs on offer - the idea was right, fine leg was inside the ring and he was looking to clear him - late on the shot, off the gloves and past the diving keeper"
7651,"FOUR, beautifully played, length ball and Parthiv was waiting on it, gets a good stride forward and thumps it over mid-off, couple of bounces and over the ropes"
7652,"out Bowled!! No need to appeal for this - a corker from Gopal and he has got rid of the team and India captain - A loose shot from batsman, another wrong 'un and he didn't read it, lazily pressed forward on the drive - big gap between bat and pad and the ball found its way through, crashed into the off and middle stump and batsman has to go. Not the most convincing of knocks from the captain - 23 off 25 is plain average at this level. Replays suggested a thin inside edge. batsman b bowler 23(25) [4s-3]"
7653,"FOUR, cheeky from AB, a pre-meditated lap sweep, bends down low, uses the pace on the ball and laps it past the keeper for a boundary"
7654,"FOUR, lovely shot, bowler - from round the wicket, slides this one onto Parthiv's hips, he gets inside the line, uses the angle and clips it behind square on the on-side for a boundary"
7655,"FOUR, streaky and four, fuller length delivery and well wide of off, AB saw the width and threw his hands at that, gets a thick inside edge that races past the off-stump"
7656,"FOUR, Parthiv is putting on a show here - bowler leaks 16 in his first over, width on offer and Parthiv chopped it behind square on the off-side, to backward point's right and the man in the deep had a lot to do - can't get there despite the slide"
7657,"out Caught&Bowled!! Gopal got rid of Kohli, he now gets rid of AB - this is simply sublime stuff from the Karnataka leg-spinner - and he's doing all the damage to his home based franchise. Another wrong 'un, think AB read as he went back, stayed a bit low and that meant the ball caught the leading edge on the flick. It was dying down on the bowler who does remarkably well to dive forward and grab it. After the fine start, team have lost their two big guns. batsman c and b bowler 13(9) [4s-2]"
7658,"FOUR, batsman is off and running. Done with his sighter and stands tall to this length delivery. Gets on top of the bounce and caresses it through the gap at extra cover"
7659,"1 run, edged and dropped. That's an early chance that goes begging for team and Saini can't do much because it's the skipper Virat Kohli who puts it down. Short of a length and held its line just outside off, batsman chased with no feet and feeds an outside edge that flew very quickly to first slip where Virat was standing a bit wide. The team skipper moved swiftly to his right, got both hands but grasses it. Probably, didn't anticipate it to come so quickly at him"
7660,"FOUR, batsman rubs salt into team's wounds. Fullish and stops on the pitch a bit, batsman didn't go with full conviction, just checks his loft straight down the ground and it races away to the fence"
7661,"FOUR, wow! This was brute power. Dismissive stuff from batsman. Saini floats up a half-volley just outside off, batsman with his quicksilver hands lunges across and slaps it with precision through extra cover"
7662,"FOUR, streaky! Slightly slower - 129.9kph, doesn't bounce much and batsman is early into his pull shot as he fetches from outside off. Gets a fat inside edge that eludes the leg-stump and runs away to the fine leg fence"
7663,"FOUR, batsman doesn't need sighters against his fellow countryman! Fifty for batsman and he brings it up in style. Tossed up ball, batsman skips down the pitch and batters it straight down the ground. No chance for the long-off fielder"
7664,"SIX, bowler as expected shortens his length, but in the process has over-corrected. A half-tracker, batsman is quick to jump back and pummel the pull over deep mid-wicket"
7665,"out Caught by Stoinis!! Second wicket for bowler. Needless from batsman. The asking rate is under control and he wants to go after team's best bowler. Pays the price for doing so. Smart bowling from bowler, though. A slow, tossed up ball outside off, which spun further away from the right-handed batsman. batsman decides to thump it over long-off, miscues and Stoinis takes a calm catch well in front of the boundary ropes. batsman c Stoinis b bowler 59(43) [4s-8 6s-1]"
7666,"FOUR, 139.8kph, length ball outside off, batsman gets a thick outside edge as he looks to force it through the off-side. He did open his bat-face, but it was clearly off the edge. Goes fine to third man for four more"
7667,"FOUR, 125.3kph, a harmless short ball that sits up nicely for the right-hander. Tripathi waits for it on the back foot and easily pulls it over mid-wicket for a one-bounce four"
7668,"1 run, dropped! No, team don't want to bat sensibly. batsman decides to go after this flighted delivery outside off from bowler with an inside-out loft. Doesn't middle and hits it straight to sweeper cover, where Umesh decides to be generous and puts down a dolly! Oh, team!"
7669,"FOUR, 139.5kph, fuller than a good length ball outside off. The width was on offer for Tripathi to free his arms and the Royals batter takes full toll of it. Presses forward and lifts it handsomely over extra cover. Classy shot!"
7670,"SIX, heaved away for a maximum. Too predictable. Yet another slower delivery from bowler, it was in the arc outside off. batsman picked it early, moved across towards off and swung his bat hard to smash it over cow corner"
7671,"FOUR, 142.2kph, full toss on the stumps, Tripathi backs away a long way and carves it behind backward point. Used the bowler's pace to his advantage did Tripathi"
7672,"1 run, Negi dives forward at mid-wicket, but fails to hold onto it. Short ball and batsman pulls of the top part of the bat, it kept dipping at the fielder, but carried to Negi. Tough chance"
7673,"1 run, another drop! Short again and Tripathi gets a top-edge on his pull, Moeen runs to his right from deep mid-wicket and slides, fails to snaffle it. Dew factor?"
7674,"out Caught by U Yadav!! bowler bowls length outside off, batsman clears his front leg and backs himself to clear the fence. Doesn't get the timing right and spoons a simple catch to Umesh at long-on. batsman c U Yadav b bowler 38(31) [4s-2 6s-1]"
7675,"SIX, Tripathi caps off the match in style. A short ball at 139.1kph, Tripathi picked the length early, got into a good position and pulled it fiercely over deep mid-wicket. Rajasthan Royals win by 7 wickets"
7676,"FOUR, that's criminal from Umesh. Veers it down leg with fine leg inside the ring, easy-peasy for batsman. Slower ball, goes all awry and batsman with soft hands that beats the keeper"
7677,"FOUR, consecutive fours for batsman. Umesh corrects his length and pounds it short just outside off, batsman exploits the width and flashes his bat. Hetmyer should've done well at point, fails to stop it and off she goes to the fence in a hurry"
7678,"FOUR, boom! That's a fierce slap from batsman. Suddenly, it's raining boundaries for team. Very full and overpitches in the process just outside off, batsman conserves some energy by wielding his bat and creams the drive through extra cover"
7679,"byes, FOUR, nothing is going right for team at the moment. Sloppy from Nath. Full and swerved in a little, batsman failed to connect on the big heave and Nath makes a mess of it behind. Very lazy stuff, was late to bend down and misses it altogether"
7680,"FOUR, this looked intentional from batsman. Shows off his dexterity. Lenght delivery cutting back in just outside off, batsman uses the pace and opens his bat face at the last moment in running it past short third man, who's dive went in vain"
7681,"FOUR, woah! This is a very uncharacteristic from batsman. Kohli-esque wristy flick. Very full and around off, batsman shuffles across and twirls his wrists at the nth minute to clip it nonchalantly through mid-wicket. All swag from the team skipper!"
7682,"FOUR, lofted over extra cover. He's one of the best manipulators on the off-side. But Saini keeps providing him with freebies like these. Pitched fuller and just outside off, batsman shifts his weight forward and handsomely lifts it over the in-field"
7683,"out Lbw!! bowler strikes. Gets the breakthrough for team which should give them some respite. Googly, spinning in and batsman was trying to make room to cut. Was late to get his bat down and fails to read it. It thuds him on the pad - in-line with the stumps. Total misjudgement from the team skipper, looked plumb straightaway and the umpire was spot on. Would've crashed into the middle stump. batsman knew that he was in trouble and didn't bother it review it. batsman lbw b bowler 22(20) [4s-4]"
7684,"FOUR, short and put away behind square with disdain. Nothing delivery from bowler, can't drop at this length, especially at his pace. Sits up nicely for batsman, who takes full toll of it"
7685,"FOUR, expertly done by batsman. bowler went for the slower short ball but batsman was upto the challenge. Jumped high and plays the pull off the front foot over mid-wicket. Generates some power and collects four"
7686,"out Caught by de Kock!! There's a noise and batsman's gone. His poor form continues and it's a first-baller for the opener. But what a corker from bowler this was. Pounded it short, sprang up like a spitting Cobra after hitting the deck just outside off. batsman was just pushing his bat forward aiming to defend. Scary extra bounce scraps the shoulder of the bat and carries to QDK. bowler is elated and Mumbai have struck early. batsman c de Kock b bowler 0(1)"
7687,"FOUR, edged and flies over the slips. Doesn't matter how they come but batsman will take it. Fuller length and seaming away just outside off, batsman goes hard on the downtown swing and gets a thick outside edge which balloons over to the third man fence"
7688,"out Caught by Pollard!! In the air and taken. Straight to Pollard at cover-point, who juggles a bit and holds onto it. Both openers back in the shed for team and it's been a wonderful start for Mumbai. Short and well wide of off, batsman cuts and doesn't keep it down. Hits it airly and finds Pollard, who leaps and it bobbled out of his hands, but he keeps his calm and grabs it on the second attempt. Wankhede explodes.. batsman c Pollard b bowler 5(6) [4s-1]"
7689,"FOUR, much needed boundary for team! Jadhav didn't get hold of the slog sweep that well here, still got enough and also found the placement well. Speeds away to the deep square leg fence"
7690,"out Caught by Suryakumar Yadav!! batsman departs! Never got going today and with the required rate soaring, he had to take a risk. Tries but doesn't work. Stepped out in a premeditated manner and Hardik smartly dug it short, at the body, cramping MS completely. The result is a forced pull and it's aerial too. Dolly for Surya at square leg. Massive dent to team's already fading chances in the game. batsman c Suryakumar Yadav b bowler 12(21)"
7691,"out Caught by de Kock!! Second in the over for Hardik! What a game he is having! A blitzing cameo earlier in the night and now two strikes with the ball. Pounded this on the hard length with good pace, batsman was backing away for the slash but got done in by the speed. Too late and gets a healthy nick that's pouched by a beaming de Kock. Wheels coming off for team. Not far away from hearing the fat lady sing. batsman c de Kock b bowler 1(2)"
7692,"leg byes, FOUR, not off the bat but team won't mind. Was angling in on leg stump and Bravo shuffled early for the flick. Off the pads and races away down to the fine leg fence"
7693,"FOUR, cheeky way to bring up a fine fifty! Shortish with good bounce from bowler, Jadhav just waits and dabs it with an open face. Well wide of de Kock and quite fine to the third man fence. It's been a good knock so far from Jadhav but he has lacked support"
7694,"FOUR, sensational stroke! It was fed on the pads, yes, but the execution of the stroke was superb from Jadhav. Drop kicks it through backward square leg and a sliding Bumrah from fine leg can't cut it off. Perfect start for team in this over"
7695,"out Caught by de Kock!! Jadhav's defiance ends. Fought hard but with this kind of a target, he needed support which he never got. Slower ball from bowler and Jadhav went for a wild heave across the line. Only manages a thin feather through to de Kock who is having a good time behind the sticks. batsman c de Kock b bowler 58(54) [4s-8 6s-1]"
7696,"SIX, smoked! Probably has come a bit too late in the game I reckon. Bravo picked the slower ball this time and swung this merrily into the third tier at long-on. Mammoth blow"
7697,"out Caught by de Kock!! Stunner from QDK! Brilliance from the South African and that's the end of a forgettable night for Bravo. Made room for the big shot but this was in the blockhole, cramped him as well and he got a faint inside edge. De Kock was initially blinded, as keepers usually are in such a scenario, but reacted sharply with a two-handed diving catch to his left. Excellent work indeed and that's the third of the night for bowler. batsman c de Kock b bowler 8(9) [6s-1]"
7698,"FOUR, nicely struck! Overpitched and batsman makes room to biff it over extra cover. Clean hit and in the gap as well"
7699,"out Caught by Bumrah!! Another one bites the dust. The hard length has done the trick many a time on this pitch tonight and here is another example of it. Well-directed pacy bumper and batsman gets into a tangle on the pull after having backed away early. Gets a top edge towards deep backward square leg where Bumrah takes a running catch, having covered decent ground from fine leg. batsman c Bumrah b bowler 7(7) [4s-1]"
7700,"SIX, in the air for an eternity and it's also cleared the ropes! Not a bad hit from a lower order batsman. Fuller length from Hardik and Thakur lifts it high down the ground. Plenty of elevation and just about has the distance to clear long-off"
7701,"FOUR, smacked hard! Thakur having some fun here. Another overcooked delivery from Hardik with width on offer, blasted away through extra cover and well wide of long-off. Handy runs for team to reduce the margin of defeat"
7702,"SIX, typical inside-out shot from batsman. Triggers his back leg, creates some room to this full ball and lifts it beautifully over cover. The timing was supreme and it clears the ropes for a maximum"
7703,"SIX, flicked away for a six. Horror delivery from bowler, very identical to the previous ball. Slanting it on the legs, Jadhav ain't missing out on these freebies. Walks across and helps it away expertly over short fine leg. Almost smashed it towards the Harrier car"
7704,"FOUR, this is poor bowling from bowler. He's just not finding his lines right. For the umpteenth time, drifts it down leg. Bread and butter for Jadhav, who picks it away over short fine leg. Behrendorff leaps but it comfortably clears him"
7705,"FOUR, educated edge and batsman collects a boundary. Shortish just outside off, batsman intentionally opens the bat face at the last minute and guides it through the vacant slip cordon. Cheekily done!"
7706,"FOUR, consecutive fours for batsman and the ""team, team"" chants are back. bowler wafts it full and gives some width for batsman to free his arms. Lifted over mid-off, holds his shape nicely and desperate chase from the fielder but in vain"
7707,"out Caught by Pollard!! Oh my word! There's that customary stunner from Pollard for the season. His batting form may have dipped but not his fielding and catching. This is smart field placement from Rohit and bowler executed it well. Dug it short and offered width, batsman forgets there's a fielder at sweeper cover. Slashed it on the up and Pollard was waiting for it. Though he kind of charged in a bit early, he made sure he kept his calm and stretched his giant right hand to nonchalantly grab it. Dives and thumps his chest towards the team fans in the stands. Blinder from the big man and team in trouble now. batsman c Pollard b bowler 16(15) [4s-2 6s-1]"
7708,"FOUR, dismissive pull from Jadhav. Skiddy short of length just outside off, Jadhav gets quickly onto the back foot and short-arm jabs it wide of mid-on. Rolled his wrists at the right time to find the gap"
7709,"FOUR, wow! Helicoptered over mid-on. Brilliant from Jadhav. It was nearly a yorker length from bowler, Jadhav took his front leg out of the way and stayed deep. Lifted it excellently over mid-on. Even the inventor of the helicopter shot, MS Dhoni - who's at the other end - would've enjoyed that"
7710,"FOUR, four more. He's a smart customer, is the pocket-rocket Jadhav. bowler is under pressure now. Peppered it short outside off, Jadhav cleverly arched his back at the last moment and elevated it over the slip. Third man had no chance and he'll collect a boundary"
7711,"FOUR, outside edge and beats short third man. Floated up, spins away after pitching and lures Jadhav into a drive, who goes with hard hands and gets an thick outside edge. Zooms away to the third man fence"
7712,"FOUR, fired down the leg-side, Suryakumar gets down on one knee and sweeps it fine past the man at 45"
7713,"FOUR, this will ease his nerves a bit. bowler is bowling back of length balls so there was no long-off in place. batsman moves forward, and lofts it over mid-off. The timing again wasn't great but it was good enough to get it over mid-off"
7714,"FOUR, poor effort from Rayudu in the deep. And that will result in a four. Back-to-back fours for team and Krunal. It was short and was on the body, batsman gets behind it and pulls it with a lot of power to deep square leg. Rayudu there should have easily stopped it but instead he lets it go"
7715,"no run, in the air and dropped! Mohit Sharma is the culprit. Krunal wanted to clear mid-off, fails to do so and ends up hitting it straight to Mohit at mid-off. It was hit hard and Mohit fails to get his fingers in the right position to grab it"
7716,"no run, Review time: batsman has been given out lbw. And he has taken the review. I don't reckon there is an inside edge on it. UltraEdge will confirm it. And there is a spike on UltraEdge. Just a tiny bit but that will be enough to save Krunal. Rod Tucker will have to change his decision. It nips back in off the deck, batsman wanted to heave it to the on-side, plays it down the wrong line and it raps him on the pads. It looked plumb to the naked eye but an inside edge saves Krunal"
7717,"SIX, that's an old-fashioned heave. And it will clear long-on with ease. It was a leggie on the stumps, batsman clears his leg, keeps his shape and dispatches it into the stands"
7718,"FOUR, nicely done from batsman! He was anticipating a slower one and it indeed was one, batsman backs away, makes room and eases it past short third for a boundary. No need to run for that!"
7719,"2 runs, yorker on the stumps and batsman drills it down the ground. Jadeja of all people misfields it at long-off and that will allow batsmen to take an extra run"
7720,"FOUR, time to buy a lottery ticket, Krunal! He has been saved three or four times in this knock so far. It was a slower one wide of off, batsman attempts a slog, it comes off the outside half of the bat and just about clears short third. Jadhav gives a chase but ball will win"
7721,"FOUR, just above the cover fielder. Can you believe it, he is teasing the fielders to the fullest at the moment. It was on a fuller length and was wide of off, batsman gets it just enough bat on it to send it to fence"
7722,"out Caught by Jadeja!! A scratchy innings from batsman comes to an end. But it was an important innings. It was a slower one on a length, batsman wanted to clobber it to the on-side. He swings it down the wrong line, it clips the outside half of the bat and was in the air for a long time. Jadeja at long-on comes under it and takes it with utmost ease. batsman c Jadeja b bowler 42(32) [4s-5 6s-1]"
7723,"SIX, that's Surya-special for you! He shuffles towards the off-side, picks up the slower one, goes down on his knees and slog sweeps it over deep mid-wicket. Into the stands!. Fifty for Surya with this big-hit!"
7724,"FOUR, that has been clobbered down the ground. And it will beat Jadeja at the long-on fence. bowler misses the yorker just a bit but that allows batsman to get under it and power it straight back past the bowler. Jadeja dived full-stretch but his effort went in vain"
7725,"out Caught by Jadeja!! A brilliant innings from Surya comes to an end. His knock has ensured that Mumbai reach close to the par score on this wicket. He fails to get under the yorker, but still goes through with the hit. Ends up skying it in the air and Jadeja at long-on makes no mistake. batsman c Jadeja b bowler 59(43) [4s-8 6s-1]"
7726,"SIX, that's an air-strike from batsman. You cannot bowl length to Hardik at this stage, he gets behind it, keeps his shape and absolutely smashes it over deep mid-wicket. It went a long way back into the stands"
7727,"1 run, steers it wide of backward point and they will take a single. Dhoni fumbles and batsman wanted a double, MS quickly recovered and had he hit at the non striker's end, Pandya would have been in trouble"
7728,"SIX, batsman power for you! It was on a length and was wide of off, batsman stays in the crease and smashes it over long-on with utter disdain for a maximum. Hardik Pandya at the non striker's end loved it too!"
7729,"no ball, SIX, just praised his skill of bowling yorkers and guess what, he delivers a full-toss above the waist height. batsman larrups it over deep mid-wicket for a gigantic six. Free-hit coming up! It wasn't above the waist height so that was a harsh call from the umpire"
7730,"SIX, wow! Just wow! You will very rarely see a better power hit than this. It was a yorker on ths stumps, batsman was deep in the crease and uses his wrists to dispatch it over deep mid-wicket for a massive maximum. Wrist of steel from the younger Pandya!"
7731,"FOUR, he has powered this one for another four. batsman is playing a gem. It was a fuller length delivery wide of off, batsman reaches for it and pumps it wide of cover for another boundary. He loved it! Punches the air in delight!"
7732,"FOUR, inside edge past the sticks. It's always dangerous playing a horizontal shot to an inswinging delivery, batsman wanted to cut, luckily it missed the poles and beat fine leg"
7733,"out Caught by Kedar Jadhav!! He does it again, bowler! Bowls tight, builds pressure and forces the mistake. Such as asset he's turned out to be for Dhoni and Co. This is an inswinging short of length delivery, batsman wanted to smash this to the mid-wicket boundary as the runs weren't coming, the bat turned in his hands as he slogged at this and it went straight to square leg. bowler roars in delight. Mind you, QdK is in great form and it's not easy to keep him calm. batsman c Kedar Jadhav b bowler 4(7) [4s-1]"
7734,"SIX, 29 off the last over! And Mumbai ends the innings in a sensational fashion. It was a fuller length delivery wide of off, batsman uses his wrists brilliantly again to lift it over deep backward point for another maximum"
7735,"FOUR, overpitched and Suryakumar just essays a lovely cover drive. Gentle step forward and then the free flow of the bat, he ball bounced over cover-point, that tells you how good the square is. A batsman's paradise it should be"
7736,"FOUR, team need more of these. The start doesn't justify the surface on offer, yes team bowled tight, but they could have had more runs. This is full and on the stumps, Suryakumar on-drives and beats mid-on"
7737,"FOUR, in the airrrr and just wide of cover-point. It went just a yard or two away from Raina's outstretched left arm. Short and wide delivery, poor delivery, batsman cuts uppishly and gets away with it"
7738,"FOUR, now then, this is too much from team! Yes, the ball is swinging away, but you can't have such a big Test-match kind of gap at cover in a T20 game and this isn't the red ball which moves better. Fullish and outside off stump, Suryakumar easily drives and picks up a boundary"
7739,"FOUR, oh shot! Brilliant hit, the shot of the game thus far and will take some doing to beat this. A simple on-drive it looks like, but it's tough to play an on-drive with a straight bat to the right of mid-on, let the short of length delivery come and timed it sweetly, Rayudu gives chase and loses the race"
7740,"FOUR, freebie down the leg-side and Suryakumar won't miss out after this kind of a start, a gentle flick shot in the gap at mid-wicket and that's all you need at the Wankhede with a fast outfield"
7741,"out Caught by Dhoni!! What a start for bowler. Gets a faint edge and Dhoni manages to cling on. Flighted delivery pitching on the off stump and spinning away sharply, batsman tried defending but the feet were stuck in the crease. Dhoni made no mistake and also checked the bails off to be doubly sure about the dismissal as Ro was close with his back foot in the crease. Tough catch because the ball almost shaved the off stump as well. Oh they are checking for the no-ball, Raina blocks the side angle from deep cover, but the other angle shows a very minute portion of the heel to be behind the crease when bowler landed. Third umpire is convinced and it will be OUT. A sluggish start from batsman, he needs to be a lot more positive as an opener. batsman c Dhoni b bowler 13(18) [4s-1]"
7742,"out Caught by Rayudu!! bowler takes off on his celebratory run. Fullish delivery outside off stump, batsman lofts looking for a six, targetted the long-off region, but Rayudu was stationed perfectly under it. He was very close to the rope, but did exceedingly well to balance himself just inside the boundary. Umps check with the third umpire with the soft signal being OUT, replays confirmed it was a clean catch. batsman c Rayudu b bowler 4(6)"
7743,"FOUR, out comes the reverse paddle from Krunal, third man was inside the ring, so he did well to get bat on ball and it escaped to the boundary to ease some pressure"
7744,"FOUR, oh my word! What a shot, definitely not a bad ball at all. The end result of this back foot punch was great, but that's not how you should actually be playing. Worked on that occasion, could have been a drag on another day. Inswinger from Bhuvi, Shaw has this strange ability to play off the back foot to ones that aren't actually short, the ball escapes through the gap at cover"
7745,"FOUR, it's such a poor idea to remove the slip without seeing through at least one over, Bhuvi does this time and again, now one escapes through the vacant cordon, a wide slip would have had him. Short of a length delivery outside off stump, Shaw looks to punch off the back foot, gets a thick edge that runs away to the third man fence"
7746,"no run, close call! But umpire Anantha Padmanabhan is a happy man. The slider which skids on and pings Tewatia on the front pad before deflecting onto the back, he played for the turn when there wasn't any. Ball-tracking showed it to be clipping leg-stump"
7747,"FOUR, lovely shot! Tewatia can bat. And he can to do it at a brisk rate. Delhi would want him to get them the momentum. On a length around off, Tewatia stays leg-side and uses the space he created to drive on the rise past mid-off"
7748,"out Caught by Nabi!! Gone! The promotion does not work out for Delhi. Another knuckle and this time there is no bounce to save Tewatia, he is completely fooled by it and just leaves his bat hanging in front, the ball pops towards cover and Nabi completes the dolly. batsman c Nabi b bowler 5(7) [4s-1]"
7749,"FOUR, much needed for Delhi. The crowd find their voice with this boundary. Sandeep bangs it in short and at his pace on this surface it sat up, Iyer thumps the pull over mid-wicket and the ball raced away to the fence"
7750,"1 run, Ingram had given up. Iyer taps it in front of point and sets off, Ingram had to respond and he just hoped Pandey missed, he did and the southpaw survives. It was not far though"
7751,"out Caught by Manish Pandey!! Pandey has his man this time. Missed the direct hit but makes up with a terrific catch. Delhi slip further as the experienced batsman departs. He sees the shortish length and the width outside off, cracks the cut towards backward point and the ball was dying in front of the Pandey, who dived across and caught it centimeters from the ground. batsman c Manish Pandey b bowler 5(8)"
7752,"FOUR, almost similar to the Ingram delivery. Slow but on the shorter side outside off, Morris keeps the cut down and hits it behind point, got enough power to beat third man in the deep"
7753,"no run, that did not look close. Not sure what made Rashid go for the review. The leg-break and Morris misses the sweep, the ball misses the front pad and strikes the back thigh, impact was always one of the issues and the turn took it past off-stump"
7754,"FOUR, that is a top shot. Iyer has been so good today. He has waited for the bad delivery and once he has got one, he's ensured to put it away. This was an overpitch and Iyer smacks it straight back over Rashid"
7755,"out Bowled!! Cleans him up! Body blow to Delhi's chances of posting a fighting total. It's the skipper who's fallen. Iyer looked alright in his stay tonight but won't be there for the final flourish. Not the wisest of shots either, goes for a wild slog sweep against Khan, was the googly and hence, the shot was on. But it needed better execution as well which didn't happen. Sneaks through to ruffle the sticks. batsman b bowler 43(41) [4s-3 6s-1]"
7756,"SIX, clobbered! Got hold of this alright, big Morris! Slower ball on a shortish length, the South African picked it early and swatted it high over deep square leg. Much-needed one for team"
7757,"out Caught by Nabi!! Another one falls prey to the slower ball. On such a sluggish surface, it's expected really but even then, team's batsmen have mostly failed to apply themselves. Can't fault Morris though for going big with less than two overs left. Tries to go over cover but it's the slower ball that's well wide outside off, he had to reach it and mistimed it horribly. Spoons a dolly to extra cover. batsman c Nabi b bowler 17(15) [4s-1 6s-1]"
7758,"2 runs, Sandeep spills a sitter! Inexcusable really. Was a fuller one from bowler and batsman went for the pick up shot. Got more height than distance on it and Sandeep should have gobbled this. Got under it well but probably lost balance a touch. Not only has he dropped it, but also allowed team to get a brace"
7759,"FOUR, fine shot from batsman! Width on offer and although the length isn't very full, his hands do the rest as he powers this through extra cover. Finds the gap perfectly"
7760,out Caught by Bhuvneshwar!! That's the end of batsman. Had to try the big shot with this being the final over but Kaul outsmarts him with an off cutter that's quite wide outside off. Was always a risk to go across the line and the result is a miscue that goes up in the air for a while towards short third man. Bhuvi calls for the catch and takes it comfortably. batsman c Bhuvneshwar b bowler 3(4)
7761,"SIX, that's some power from batsman! Didn't seem initially like he hit this that well but it went soaring over wide long-on. Slower ball on a good length, it's leg stumpish and the southpaw whips it merrily"
7762,"out Bowled!! Finally, bowler Kumar has a wicket against his name this season, in his fourth game. Well disguised slower delivery, not the knuckle ball, the traditional off-cutter, Shaw didn't read this and played an ugly swipe across the line, only to see the off pole cartwheeling. Will be interesting to see if Bhuvi refrains from bowling the knuckle ball. People have been picking them easily of late off his hand! batsman b bowler 11(11) [4s-2]"
7763,"SIX, cracking blow from batsman! Perfect finish for team. Picked the slower ball early this time, was actually getting predictable from Kaul and it's deposited straight down the ground. Clean hit and it goes crashing into the sightscreen"
7764,"SIX, excellent shot, because he played that almost with a straight bat, full and down the leg-side, the front foot opened up meant he had that area open for a free swing of the bat, timed it sweetly to clear wide long-on"
7765,"FOUR, this time backward square leg is back for bowler, but batsman sweeps this very fine from him and also takes out the man at 45, nicely placed"
7766,"out Caught by Sandeep Sharma!! This is astute planning from bowler. batsman plays the sweep to the spinners. He knows this is a spinning surface, so pushed backward square leg back and kept fine leg in to invite batsman, who fell in the trap top-edging a sweep to short fine leg. The length was full enough to play the shot, but it turned to take the edge. The line was also slightly outside off. batsman c Sandeep Sharma b bowler 12(14) [4s-1]"
7767,"FOUR, full toss to begin with, Iyer creamed that nicely along the ground to cover, freebie to begin with from bowler"
7768,"out Caught by Hooda!! Wicket right after the break. How many times have we seen that! And it is a big one. batsman, who scored a hundred against this team last yer at the same venue, holes out in the deep. Flighted outside off, batsman bends forward and does not go through with the loft, just a check-lift and it still ends up near the long-off rope, Hooda used his height well and took it over his head right on the edge of the fence. batsman c Hooda b bowler 5(7)"
7769,"FOUR, fine shot to start for batsman! Picked the googly and got across on one knee to sweep it hard. Connected well, got it wide of short fine leg and it raced away"
7770,"no run, dropped! bowler has landed badly it seems. Was a fairly straightforward chance though and he spilled it. batsman used his feet for the lofted hit and ended up stroking it straight back at bowler who reacted quickly, had two bites at the cherry but couldn't cling on. Would have been a massive wicket for team"
7771,"out Caught by Prithvi Shaw!! Pick. Heave. And perfectly picking out the fielder. bowler Sharma - hidden all this while for some strange reason - comes, keeps hitting his trademark back of a length on the tummy. Pandey tries making some room to this and swipes it in quite an agricultural hack. Can't keep it down. Can't get the distance on it either. Bang. Deep square leg. batsman c Prithvi Shaw b bowler 10(13)"
7772,"FOUR, and here's the overcompensated rubbish to follow up the ripper. Drifting well down leg, very full too .. and swept away firmly behind square"
7773,"no run, dropped -- Shreyas Iyer of all people -- and it just doesn't get simpler. batsman drives uppishly, hard, finds extra cover, where Iyer reverse cups, and is a little too casual"
7774,"out Caught by Shreyas Iyer!! The pitch-grip does its bit. And add to it batsman's attempt to go a little too powerfully at this. It was short, innocuous-looking, and then it sticks in the surface, making batsman lose all shape as he commits to his slap -- eventually dragging it tamely to extra cover, where life gives Iyer a second chance, and he doesn't mess it up. batsman c Shreyas Iyer b bowler 16(21) [4s-1]"
7775,"FOUR, when you're six-foot-something, you'd rather use it. Well Pathan does, stretching forward big time, getting to the pitch of the ball outside off and nailing his sweep behind square. Rabada tries sweeping and diving, but no, can't"
7776,"out Caught by Rabada!! bowler ends with a googly. bowler ends with a wicket. batsman hasn't been reading it well all innings, so does what the manual teaches on such occasions - sweep - and so what if the line is well outside off? batsman commits, gets a big top-edge and Rabada's waiting there at deep mid-wicket. Delhi making Hyderabad pull off a Delhi? batsman c Rabada b bowler 10(11) [4s-1]"
7777,"FOUR, oh easy. Short, but not short enough. Leg-lined and leg-lined enough. Quick and real quick enough. All batsman needs is a bat, swivelling, pulling and getting enough of a tickle fine past the keeper"
7778,"FOUR, drags it off the inside half, ahh, no wonder it's a batsman's game. bowler tries a slower cutter on the stumps, which batsman makes room to and tries slicing over the covers -- but ends up with the edge on the inside pulling through an empty cow corner. Just a shot stands in between Hyderabad and a victory"
7779,"SIX, oh and he isn't wasting around. bowler tries delaying things with a real fierce bumper, you know, quick, climbing up outside off. But batsman backs away bigger, swishes outside off and upper-slices .. and Kotla is tiny, really tiny to stop Hyderabad from topping the table"
7780,"SIX, G-I-G-A-N-T-I-C! Made a cracking sound off the blade and batsman has sent this into the top tier at long-on. There was plenty of flight and he absolutely clouted this"
7781,"FOUR, more runs! A wild slog this time from batsman who picked the googly but got it off the inside half of the blade. Still had enough on it to find the deep mid-wicket fence"
7782,"no run, review wasted! Shockingly poor review! Iyer didn't do the right thing by agreeing to an emotional bowler. This pinned batsman on the pad after missing the sweep. Always seemed to pitch outside leg but the leggie somehow convinced his skipper, despite a rejection from Pant. Result is, pitched outside leg and review gone in the drain. Poor, poor stuff"
7783,"FOUR, he's carrying on from where he right off in Hyderabad. team are helping him by offering pace too. Morris bangs this short and that's right down batsman's ally. Forehand pull pumped away to the deep mid-wicket fence"
7784,"FOUR, clears the infield! batsman's intentions very clear, he wants to kill the game in the Powerplay. Not really in the slot but he goes through with the chip shot down the ground. Easily over mid-on and it speeds to the fence"
7785,"FOUR, he's toying around with the bowling, batsman. Another loose half tracker and he picks it up with a shovel pull over short fine leg. Wrong line and duly punished"
7786,"leg byes, FOUR, bonus runs! They all count though. Pacy delivery on leg stump, was a freebie in every sense and though batsman couldn't get bat on the flick, it brushes the pad and splits the keeper and short fine leg"
7787,"byes, FOUR, It goes through everyone. It was a short of length delivery, keeps low, batsman was taken aback by the low bounce. He fails to get any bat to it. It misses the leg-stump by a whisker and the low bounce beats Pant too"
7788,"FOUR, Jonny is on fire! He dashes down the ground, wasn't to the pitch of the ball still goes through with the shot and times it well enough to smash it down the ground for a boundary"
7789,"FOUR, kind of a shot Jonny would salivate upon for days! It was on a fuller length and was on the stumps, batsman takes a good stride forward and creams it through cover for a boundary. Another 50-run wasy partnership for Jonny and Warner. It's an easy game for them at the moment"
7790,"FOUR, wow! Jonny, you champion! He can't do nothing wrong at the moment. Waits for the slower one, delays his bat swing and tonks it straight down the ground"
7791,"FOUR, that's edged and four! All of a sudden, this has become a different match. We are playing on the same wicket, mind you! It was a fuller length delivery on the stumps, batsman waits for it to arrive and opens the face of the bat at the very last moment to guide it past third man. No stopping that!"
7792,"out Lbw!! bowler gets the all-important breakthrough. But is it too late for Delhi? It was a slider on a fuller length, it skids off the deck. batsman was late on the shot, it misses his bat and raps him on the pads. Umpire raised his finger straightaway but optimistic Jonny challenged that decision (I don't know why) and was proved wrong within minutes. He misses his fifty by 2 runs. But has done enough damage at the top to put his team in the driver's seat. batsman lbw b bowler 48(28) [4s-9 6s-1]"
7793,"out Caught by Chris Morris!! Two quick wickets for Delhi and they are still alive in this match, only just though. The middle-order of team hasn't been tested yet so the next phase can be an interesting one. It was a fuller length delivery attacking the stumps, batsman was getting restless. He goes back and wanted to lift it over mid-off, no timing on it and ends up hitting to Morris at mid-off who takes a good low catch. batsman c Chris Morris b bowler 10(18)"
7794,"FOUR, gee! He is in some form these days, few months back, he would have hit it straight to cover. But, not now! He clobbers it over cover, bat turns in his hands but that didn't make any difference. It canters to the fence"
7795,"2 runs, massive top-edge. Massive swirl on the ball and it's gone a mile into the night-sky. Who wants it? Parthiv and Saini back-track but it's taking an eternity to come down. Oopsy. Saini gets to the ball but can't quite hold onto it. So, it will go down as a drop, tough chance but lucky Lynn. It was a shortish and bounced more than Lynn expected as he went for the pull. What's worse is that it dribbles away to the boundary after Saini shelled it"
7796,"FOUR, adding insult to injury. Poor follow up delivery from bowler, drifting on the pads and Lynn duly puts it away with a fine clip off his pads over short fine leg"
7797,"FOUR, not a good finish by bowler. Another loosener outside off, too short and wide of off. Lynn throws his bat and drills it hard along the ground through extra cover. Strong bottom-hand power and beats a desperate dive from Klaasen at sweeper cover"
7798,"FOUR, the plan was right from Saini, almost had batsman in trouble but somehow the batsman manages to help it away towards the fine leg fence. Bouncer following batsman, who was moving to leg and he gets cramped for all room because of the spicy bounce but batsman manages get it away to the boundary"
7799,"FOUR, miss the yorker, get set to face the penalty. Saini misses it by an inch, ends up as a low full toss and batsman after clearing his front leg, whips it to the left of mid-on. Raced away in a jiffy"
7800,"out Caught by Negi!! Chinnaswamy breaks the sound barrier because batsman's dismissed. Hang on! They are checking for the no-ball but Saini's foot is fine on this occasion. So, batsman can continue his long walk back to the pavilion. Ushered it short at an awkward height for batsman - tucking him for room, who tamely pulls it without any timing. Loops up to Negi at fine leg who has to cover some ground and also mind the ad cushions. Keeps his calm and snaffles it in front of his face, making sure he doesn't make any contact with the boundary. Outstanding catch and team have lost their first wicket. Good comeback from Saini. batsman c Negi b bowler 10(8) [4s-2]"
7801,"1 run, Siraj puts down a sitter! Will this be the decisive moment in this game? team will hope not. It's a massive though, it's Lynn. Smart from bowler as he kept this slower ball wider outside off, forced Lynn to reach it and the result was a miscue that flew at a comfortable height to sweeper cover. Siraj had it covered and then let it pop out. VK is livid"
7802,"SIX, that's in the crowd! Typical powerhit from Rana. He will go after it from the word go. This was the bouncer, leg stumpish and he got inside the line to help it over fine leg. Into the second tier"
7803,"out Bowled!! Absolute ripper from bowler! bowler had been getting it to turn since ball one and with Lynn not being great against spin, this was on the cards. He was premeditating the charge down the track and bowler smartly held the length back. Kept it straighter too on middle and leg, spun sharply past the outside edge to make a mess of the stumps. The left arm spinner might well be the difference between the two sides. Lynn was looking threatening but has been removed at the right time as far as team are concerned. batsman b bowler 43(31) [4s-4 6s-2]"
7804,"FOUR, blasted away! Much-needed for team. Gets width on offer and he was hanging back for the slap-cut. Smashed hard and it's wide of sweeper as well"
7805,"SIX, clubbed over long-on! The home crowd were extremely hopeful that it would carry to the fielder but it's cleared him comfortably. Rare bad ball from bowler who gives one in the slot for Rana who doesn't try to overhit it. Just a clean bat swing to send it over the fence"
7806,"out Caught by (sub)Klaasen!! bowler has his man! He's deserved a wicket and has got a timely big strike. The ploy of bowling googlies against Rana pays dividends. The left hander charged down and wanted to go with the spin on the off-side but skewed it aerially towards sweeper cover. The sub, Klaasen, clings onto the chance, much to the relief of his mates and the energetic home crowd. batsman c (sub)Klaasen b bowler 37(23) [4s-1 6s-2]"
7807,"no run, good review in the end by DK. Got flummoxed by the fastish leg break, got pinged on the back pad as well with the turn and fizz doing him in. The umpire was late in raising his finger and batsman chose to go for the review, almost out of hope. He probably was banking on the turn to save him and that's precisely what happens. HawkEye shows to be going over the stumps"
7808,"FOUR, almost a blinder at mid-off by Kohli! Dived swiftly to his left and had it in his left hand mid-air but couldn't hold on. team have spilled quite a few already tonight and though this isn't an easy one, you'd hope that some stick at least. Was a bludgeoning drive from DK and he couldn't quite keep it down. Nearly paid the price but eventually gets a boundary"
7809,"SIX, just clears deep mid-wicket! Typical DK stroke. Half volley on leg stump, he holds his shape and doesn't go hard at it. Rather swings with the flow and it has enough to clear Chahal in the deep. The skipper is keeping team afloat"
7810,"out Caught by Chahal!! Gone this time. Can't clear Chahal on this occasion. Was again in the slot from Saini but batsman didn't get the timing right on the slog. Could only skew it high towards deep mid-wicket where the team leggie is waiting for it. Pouches the catch safely and celebrates wildly. VK is also chuffed, as he usually is when he gets excited. team are slowly going towards the finish line. batsman c Chahal b bowler 19(15) [4s-1 6s-1]"
7811,"SIX, six more! Russell has woken up! Slower and wider outside off, Russell sits back and flat-bats it down the ground. Clears the ropes with ease, as is the case when he connects well"
7812,"no ball, SIX, bowler is out of the attack! Another high full toss, Russell stays put and smokes this over deep mid-wicket. Clean hit and it goes all the way. Timely one for team but they need plenty more. Second beamer by bowler and the umpires rightfully inform VK that the pacer can't bowl anymore"
7813,"SIX, smokeyyyyyyyyyyy! Another one! In the slot from bowler, tried to keep it wide of the big man's reach but Russell gets there and swings clean through the line. Booming hit into the crowd at long-off. The chase is alive and in fact, team are now in danger"
7814,"SIX, swings it into the stands! The carnage continues. In the slot for Russell who shovels it over deep mid-wicket. Clobbered deep into the crowd. Pressure on team"
7815,"SIX, just over the third man fence! Raining sixes now. Short and wide this, third man is up and Russell goes for the upper cut. Got more height on it actually and Chahal from deep backward point fancied a running catch. Not to be"
7816,"SIX, he's gone nuts, he's gone absolutely nuts here Dre Russ! bowler misses the yorker from round the wicket, it's a low full toss and it's dumped over wide long-on. Flat maximum. It's a storm out here"
7817,"FOUR, more runs! He can do no wrong! Short ball this time, Russell waits for it and ramps merrily over Parthiv. Races away to the fence in no time"
7818,"SIX, 29 off the over! Russell has killed the game. team are dead and buried with this onslaught. In the slot from bowler, doesn't miss the yorker by much but that's enough for Russell who blasts it over long-off for another six. Scores level!"
7819,"FOUR, top-edge and over the keeper. Sometimes extra pace can let you down but Saini shouldn't mind this. Bouncer, rearing off the deck and batsman for the nth time tries the pull and gets a top-edge to his favour"
7820,"FOUR, larruped over mid-on. Easy-peasy for Lynn. bowler missed the yorker, Lynn gets deep and clears his front leg to whip it firmly over the in-field"
7821,"FOUR, back-to-back fours for Lynn. He's getting a move on. bowler overcorrects and slips in the slower short ball, Lynn waits and pulls it after twirling his wrists behind square. Big gap and he will earn a boundary"
7822,"FOUR, textbook-esque inside-out loft from batsman. All class from Robbie. Expensive over for team. Nothing delivery from bowler, pitches it right in the slot and batsman gets forward and just stylishly lifts it over extra cover"
7823,"SIX, Lynn gets into the act. Oh boy! He's launched this out of the ground. Nicely tossed up, Lynn quickly used his feet and outsmarted the bowler, flaunts his muscle power and dismisses it over long-on. New balls please!"
7824,"FOUR, woah! All timing from batsman. Very cheeky, saw the width provided, so just waited deep and steered it behind point. This outfield is pretty quick and third man can't cut it off"
7825,"FOUR, bowler is epitome of waywardness. Slips this one down leg, just help-your-self-with-a-boundary ball. batsman accepts it with glee and walks across to tickle it very fine"
7826,"no ball, SIX, this is dreadful stuff from bowler. What was he trying to bowl there? Steams in and hurls in a full toss that is just over the waist, Lynn takes full toll. Dispatches it into the deep square leg stands. It's called a no-ball for height"
7827,"FOUR, stand and deliver from batsman. Half-volley from bowler, begging to be hit and batsman takes his front foot across and slams the drive with brute power past mid-off. Nobody moved and it sped off the bat in a hurry"
7828,"FOUR, this is ridiculous from bowler. The slower bouncer, well wide of off and third man was inside the ring. Too easy for batsman, just waited and dinked it effortlessly over the fielder at 45. Big over for team, 19 coming off it"
7829,"out Caught by Southee!! This was on the cards. The pressure was building on and batsman perishes. Excellent from bowler, kept hitting the right length and forced batsman into playing a bad shot. Looped up temptingly just outside off, the batsman was early into the loft and didn't go with full conviction. Ended up checking it and offers a sitter to Southee at long-off. Virat roars in delight. Much-needed wicket for team, just to lift their spirits. batsman c Southee b bowler 33(25) [4s-6]"
7830,"FOUR, early signs that this deck is a beauty. It was banged in short, came at a comfortable hip-height for Parthiv and he whips it over short fine for a boundary"
7831,"FOUR, batsman-special! Treat for the crowd. It was on a fuller length and was on the stumps, batsman takes a good stride forward and leans into it, he times the drive superbly well. It beats the cover and races to the fence"
7832,"FOUR, back-to-back fours for batsman. And this crowd is buzzing with excitement. bowler is looking for some swing on offer, he bowls another fuller length delivery, batsman takes a good stride forward and drives it like a boss through cover. No stopping that!"
7833,"FOUR, gets loop, gets room, gets turn too. And AB decides to help it along .. stepping forward a touch and lofting it inside-out over extra cover"
7834,"FOUR, 50*35. bowler drags the length back, which means batsman decides to wait. And wait. And wait some more, before fetching a real late cut out of DK's gloves to guide it real fine"
7835,"2 runs, big miscue. Ugly, like really ugly slog-sweep, gets only a big top-edge on it -- and the skier goes into a no man's mid-off. Ferguson gives it the charge from the deep, and even his dive can't get him under it cleanly"
7836,"FOUR, dropped short. AB makes it look much, much worse, rocking behind in the crease and then throwing his weight behind a tonked loft, splitting long-off and extra cover in the deep perfectly"
7837,"FOUR, another backing in, another flat-batted throw, and another hammer over extra cover. Oh he's making it a habit, a very, very lovely-looking habit"
7838,"SIX, it's THE battle of ego .. and AB's setting it up for Russell to match. Gets a sitter on the body - yes - but picks it perfectly with his pull as he deposits it into the second tier behind square. 88 meters"
7839,"SIX, 134.4kph. And all of it is bang in the slot. Russell bowls length for some reason, ask him, and AB sinks, gets under and smokes it over long-off .. 16 off the over"
7840,"FOUR, 105.6kph. Yorker. Leg-lined. batsman's wrists are quicker, with a lot of bottom-hand flicking it away behind square. Kuldeep sweeps from fine leg, dives, and his palm can only parry it over"
7841,"SIX, 105.1kph. Length now, batsman's into death mode already, committing big-time into a tonk downtown, smashing the free-ticketers at long-on"
7842,"SIX, another cardinally ball-gone-wrong length. Oh at leasy give AB a challenge - for now he continues rocking behind and muscling them high over long-on"
7843,"FOUR, 110.9kph, ah, Djoker! The change up finally goes wrong. AB reads the long hop, stands up full height and forehands it inside-out over extra cover. It's his fifty too -- 30th"
7844,"FOUR, the horrors of a wide full toss. High. Lots of width. AB doesn't overhit, piling on and just slicing it behind point"
7845,"SIX, rank length. batsman lays in, pulling it away, hard, long, cow corner. Such is this pitch, such is this ground, such is I0$ guy, such is I0$ carnage"
7846,"FOUR, 130.7kph, just too full. batsman's already deep in his crease, incubating half vollies and then carving them inside-out over long-off"
7847,"2 runs, tickled it so damn softly into long-on, and they steal a couple well before long-on could come in .. somebody, check their shoes for nitro-boosters"
7848,"SIX, make it 19. Poor bowler's tried out everything - full tosses, bouncers, length - andhence decides to try out the one thing that remained, a back of a length sitter on the tummy. AB obliges, with a swivel, and a proper hack behind square"
7849,"out Caught&Bowled!! Ah, the perils of timing them so damn well. But Kuldeep - to his credit - is really brave to toss it up despite the carnage, and is really full as well. batsman doesn't get under, just whipping it down the pitch, hard, flat, and Yadav's stuck out palms come in between. THIS is silence. batsman c and b bowler 84(49) [4s-9 6s-2]"
7850,"FOUR, big edge. batsman misreads the googly, wafts down the wrong line, but what are outside-edges for? The ball gropes at it, running through the slip cordon"
7851,"out Caught by Shubman Gill!! Mis-pumped. bowler goes back to keeping them short, which AB actually does well to pick up and try and launch over long-off. But no, there's only SO much even a superhero can do. Gets it off the under half, without a lot of bottom-hand and Gill waits at the boundary, reverse-cupped. batsman c Shubman Gill b bowler 63(32) [4s-5 6s-4]"
7852,"FOUR, 150.3kph in a low full toss. batsman' measured this field, he knows Krishna can't bowl short with the first ball wide and then sits way, way inside his crease to slash it away through an empty point"
7853,"SIX, slower cutter, and the levers have been cut loose. batsman rocks behind and swings. No, murders. Many, many rows into mid-wicket"
7854,"FOUR, gee! batsman is in some form. He goes down on his knees and slog sweeps it over deep mid-wicket with utmost ease for a boundary"
7855,"FOUR, and gets funky. Shuffles, doesn't mind showing away his stumps as he scoops this one really fine .. 18 off this one, 205 in all, and Bangalore nail the perfect finish!"
7856,"FOUR, ball has flown off the bat. Wow! What timing! bowler did the mistake of bowling on the pads and batsman generally punishes when someone makes such mistake. He gets in a good position and whips it wide of mid-wicket for another four"
7857,"FOUR, it's raining boundaries here! It was on a fuller length and wide of off, batsman plunges forward and times the drive incredibly well. The placement was excellent too, it beats backward point and third man. And canters to the fence"
7858,"FOUR, an on-drive with a straight bat is one of the hardest shots to play in our sport. But how insanely easy batsman made it look. Class, sheer class! He comes on the front foot and drives it past mid-on for another four"
7859,"FOUR, he wants to match Kohli, It was on a fuller length and was on the stumps. Parthiv brings his bat down early and sweeps it wide of deep backward square leg for a four. Incredible bat-speed!"
7860,"1 run, 50-partnership comes up! batsman steers it wide of short third for a single"
7861,"out Lbw!! Gamble to give bowler the ball has worked for DK. Parthiv was trying a little to hard, he was looking to smash everything. But was not able to time most of the shots. This one was a slider on a good length, it skids off the deck. batsman was late on the hoick. It misses his balde and raps him on the pads. Plumb infront! batsman lbw b bowler 25(24) [4s-3]"
7862,"FOUR, bonus runs for team, exacly what they want. Very rarely, a bowler of Kuldeep's caliber delivers a morsel like this. It was down the leg-side and batsman just helps it to the the fine-leg fence with a flick"
7863,"FOUR, rank length, quite leg-lined too .. and batsman's quickly under it, sitting on a knee and sweeping it firmly through square leg"
7864,"SIX, lovely shot! Should be the shot of the match. Carrom ball from Ash, Faf picked it out of the hand, charged out and lofted it with a straight bat right back over the bowler. All the way!"
7865,"SIX, fifty for Faf. Picked for the first time and he's grabbed the opportunity. Why were they hiding him? Flighted delivery around off, Faf kneels and smokes the slog sweep into the advertising hoardings near deep mid-wicket"
7866,"out Caught by Miller!! Carrom ball and Faf is gone. Second wicket for the skipper. He spotted Faf clearing that front leg and kept the carrom ball close to him, the South African could not get underneath it and hence the mistime, Miller claims it comfortably near the long-on fence. The crowd erupts at Chepauk and that is because Thala Dhoni has walked out. batsman c Miller b bowler 54(38) [4s-2 6s-4]"
7867,"out Bowled!! Cleaned up! Two in two for bowler. Third in the game and he's delighted. On a hat-trick as well. Very poor from the experienced batsman. Just had lost Faf and he tries to slog sweep this ball, it is slower through the air and beat batsman for lack of pace, missed and the furniture is left in a mess. Wrong time for team to lose wickets. Two new batsmen at the crease now, advantage team. batsman b bowler 17(20) [4s-1]"
7868,"FOUR, pace is one thing you can't bowl on this surface. 143.2kph and batsman even advanced to make his own speed, makes just enough room to thump it over extra cover, Miller tried his best but the timing was good enough to beat him"
7869,"FOUR, and thumped! That was a mini helicopter as he smashed a full ball down the ground past long-off for a four. The ball was full, batsman just gave himself a little room and smashed it"
7870,"SIX, you can't be slotting in those balls. That was up there, missed the length by a little margin and it was smacked over deep square leg for a sixer. You miss, batsman hits it out of the park"
7871,"wide, fuller and slipped down leg-side. MS allows the ball to go through to the keeper. Ashwin has reviewed this. Was it a nick down the leg-side? It was wided and Ashwin out of the blue decided to review. Nothing of the UltraEdge and it stays as a wide. That was bizarre"
7872,"FOUR, and that wasn't timed! Off the inner half of the bat and the ball escapes into the gap between deep square and deep mid for a four. Poor delivery and was put away"
7873,"FOUR, fuller and channelling away, batsman lifts the ball away over cover and that is a four. One bounce into the fence. These death overs are his territory and bowler is messing up his lengths as well"
7874,"SIX, length ball? That was a poor one from bowler and has disappeared over long-on. batsman expanded his long handle into the shot and smoked it over long-on"
7875,"FOUR, not the smartest of bowling from bowler. The deep fine was in and bowler bowls it short. batsman hangs back and pulls it over short fine leg for a four. The Chennai crowd loving every bit of it"
7876,"FOUR, ah, neat. When there's no pace off the pitch, Faf decides to generate some himself. Lovely step away, step down and goes inside-out over mid-off"
7877,"FOUR, another bowler outfoxing. Faf continues coming down the pitch, bowler tries pulling his length back, but then Faf is happy to wait on it, present a nice full bat face in slapping it away over point"
7878,"SIX, 138kph. Now the adventure. He's done coming down the pitch, so shuffles, sits and waits under the good length to scoop it really fine .. 16 off the over"
7879,"FOUR, juicy. Full, easily down leg, and all batsman has to do is tickle - but he swings, middles his sweep behind square powerfully"
7880,"SIX, the cross-seaming sit up. bowler stays in the slot, and batsman stays tonking. Holds his pose, doesn't over-hit, and still manages to loft it all the way over long-off"
7881,"SIX, rank overcook, and Faf doesn't even have to advance out to this one - managing to stay his ground, clear out his front leg and go through the line, swinging, smoking into cow corner"
7882,"1 run, short, but nothing at all on the ball. batsman has to wait, wait some more, and then when he pulls, drags it away into the leg-side with no timing whatsoever"
7883,"no run, smashed hard .. and flush into Curran's collar bone. batsman holds nothing back here, forehards a slap down the ground, where Curran tries his desperate best to get his hands in the way, or even save his face. Is hammered into his chest"
7884,"FOUR, ruins what should've been a really good over. Slips into the pads and batsman plays some sort of a half-flick, half-sweep to nail it in the gap behind square"
7885,"out Caught by Sam Curran!! batsman has picked out cow corner - the longest part of this ground - and bowler knows this, so ends up bowling a carrom ball forcing him to go across the line and against the spin. But once a Watto commitment stays a Watto commitment, ending up in the slog sweep leading to a big top-edge, which Curran - a cool few yards inside the boundary - runs across to gather. batsman c Sam Curran b bowler 26(24) [4s-3 6s-1]"
7886,"FOUR, that line was not going to work for long, especially with third man in. Angled outside off and batsman uses that smartly to steer a boundary behind point - splitting backward point and short third"
7887,"FOUR, prodigious movement for bowler. Pitched up and late shape away for bowler just outside off. batsman goes after it, hard hands and gets a thick outside edge which eludes Bhajji at short third man"
7888,"out Caught by Dhoni!! It's throwback to 2011 IPL finals. Ravi Ashwin got rid of batsman in a similar fashion and 8 years later, Bhajji repeats it again. Big scalp for team and the crowd are delighted. bowler loads it up with flight, extracts some turn after pitching just outside off and batsman wields his bat ungainly. Slight nick and MSD grabs it and knew it straightaway. Throws it up and batsman is a goner. batsman c Dhoni b bowler 5(7) [4s-1]"
7889,"FOUR, and the dilscoop! Done really well as he scooped it over the keeper's head for a one bounce four. And batsman has a go at someone after playing the shot"
7890,"SIX, length delivery and has been driven on the up! What a shot! Has lifted the ball away over long-off for a sixer. This might be the game changing over"
7891,"1 run, very full and on the stumps, batsman knocks it down to long-off. And he will reach his maiden IPL fifty with it. He is finally coming off age"
7892,"2 runs, fuller length delivery turning back into batsman, he nudges it to the on-side. And will come back for a brace"
7893,"1 run, very full and on the stumps, works it to long-on. And he will bring up his fifty too, he is palying the role of anchor to perfection here, needs to carry on for his team"
7894,out Caught by Jadeja!! bowler's first wicket in the IPL is a huge one of batsman. This is a match-changing event for sure. batsman was waiting for the seamers to come on. And it was a given that he will go after them. He sets himself to slog this one out of the park. bowler again is smart enough to bowl an off-cutter. He gets the desired help from the deck and batsman's timing was in a mess on the slog. He could only hit it to deep mid-wicket and Jadeja there makes no mistake. He takes it with utmost ease. batsman c Jadeja b bowler 55(47) [4s-3 6s-1]
7895,"FOUR, it was in the arc for batsman and he dispatched it for a boundary. bowler after bowling brilliant slower ones decides to bowl a yorker. He fails to get the yorker right, batsman gets under and powers it wide of long-off. It rockets to the fence"
7896,"no ball, FOUR, it slips out of bowler's hand. And this is not the first time it has happened. It was a full-toss above the waist height and batsman reaches for it and smashes it wide of third man for a boundary. Free-hit coming up!"
7897,"out Bowled!! That word of advice from MSD after two shockers from bowler has made a massive difference. And he has probably won the match for team. It was a length delivery on the stumps, batsman swings and misses and it smashes the stumps. The leg-stump goes for a toss. batsman b bowler 6(5) [4s-1]"
7898,out Caught by du Plessis!! bowler on debut has won the match for team with some excellent death bowling. He has bowled slower ones after slower ones and that has worked for him brilliantly on this deck. bowler = Replica of Bravo. It was on a good length and batsman wanted to clobber it over long-on not enough willow behind it and Faf takes an easy one at long-on. batsman c du Plessis b bowler 67(59) [4s-4 6s-2]
7899,"out Caught by du Plessis!! What an over this. Double-wicket maiden. team have been jolted early and it's the in-form batsman who departs. Another tempting tossie, batsman stepped out and doesn't quite time his loft. Skies it up as far as long-on and there was a fielder waiting for this. Faf doesn't make any mistake and batsman shakes his head in disappointment. bowler roars. batsman c du Plessis b bowler 0(2)"
7900,"FOUR, glorious from batsman. Indipper on a fuller length at the stumps, batsman doesn't try to hit it too hard. Just presents a straight bat face and drives it elegantly past mid-on. His drives are a thing of beauty.."
7901,"SIX, you can't bowl short at this pace. And batsman is a good puller of the cricket ball. Quickly spotted the length, went back and hammered it powerfully over cow corner"
7902,"FOUR, follows it up with another loosener down leg, batsman makes him pay again. Tried the in-angler, overcompensates and batsman gets across to tickle it very fine. Good over for team, all the pressure created has been released now off the final two balls"
7903,"SIX, welcome to the IPL, says Sarfaraz. No respect whatsoever. It was dished out right in the arc just outside off, Sarfaraz freed his arms and opened his bat face at the right moment to clear the in-field. Lost a bit of shape but managed to chip it over point. Superb timing and it just clears the fence for a maximum"
7904,"FOUR, poor finish to the over. Too short and too wide of off, Sarfaraz goes back and opens his bat face to lace it past point. Sweeper cover tries his best but in vain"
7905,"FOUR, wonderfully done! Waits on it, and then dabs it away with an open face of the bat. Dhoni did spread his legs in anticipation but it nutmegged him"
7906,"FOUR, was that a punch or a cut! But was beautifully done as he used the pace of the bowler to send it away. The man at deep cover put in a clumsy dive but couldn't cut it off"
7907,"no run, angles the ball in, the ball strikes the inside edge and thuds into the pad. The bowler, keeper and almost the entire squad miss the inside edge and take a review. The UltraEdge makes it clear. batsman survives"
7908,"1 run, and Kaul has dropped it. Lost it in the lights may be or might have been the swirling ball coming down. Eventful first over. batsman danced out, looked to loft, got a big fat outer-edge and the man at deep third dropped it. The fielder did not even get a hand to it"
7909,"SIX, that's huge! Outta here! On the pads, batsman lifts the ball away and it soars away over deep square leg for a massive sixer"
7910,"FOUR, and the extra delivery costs them a boundary.. Quick and drifting across the left hander, Kishan plays the late cut even though there's a slip in place, but the pace of Rashid was too quick for Warner to react"
7911,"out Caught by Bairstow!! Krunal is not resurrecting the innings today like he did against team. Kaul celebrates ala Afridi - with the legs spread and the arms aloft. Mumbai sink further. A sharp short ball and Krunal is rushed on the pull, the top-edge goes straight up and Bairstow accepts the dolly. The front foot is checked again and Kaul is fine, again. batsman c Bairstow b bowler 6(13)"
7912,"out batsman Run Out!! Excellent awareness from Bairstow. He even fooled Warner at slip, who gestured that it was not out. Kishan pats it towards cover and sets off, Pollard doesn't move and the young man has to turn back, run and puts in the dive as well. By this time, Bairstow had disturbed the stumps with his pad before the throw came but he ensured he uprooted one of the stumps with the ball in his hand. Kishan's dive meant the bat popped up and he was caught short of the crease. If the stumps were not uprooted, Kishan would have survived this. batsman run out (Shankar/Bairstow) 17(21) [4s-2]"
7913,"SIX, boom! Finally, Pandya swings his bat and connects, connects big. Sees a flighted delivery, just outside off and takes it head-on. Strong muscles and biffs it a long way over the stands at long-on. Wears a cheeky smile on his face"
7914,"out Caught by Shankar!! The case of Rashid winning the battle, it's not the first time and the arms go wide in celebration. Pandya is stunned but has to go. This could dent team's prospects of posting a par total. Tosses it outside off and forces the batsman to fetch for it. Pandya goes on one-knee and clouts it across the line, airy and Vijay Shankar, manning the deep mid-wicket fence moves across and takes a smart catch. batsman c Shankar b bowler 14(14) [6s-1]"
7915,"FOUR, oh, this is nicely done by Rahul. He's no mug with the bat. Picks the googly, waits and waits before dabbing it past slip. Has enough legs to reach the fence"
7916,"1 run, in the air and Rashid grasses it. Instantly puts his hand up and apologises. Another cutter, thrown outside off. batsman flashes his bat and spanks it towards sweeper cover. Rashid runs across, covers good ground in getting towards the ball but unfortunately can't hold onto it as he slides. bowler is not happy"
7917,"FOUR, well, this is clever batting frm Rahul. He's too good with the dinks. Again picks the length delivery, gets deep in his crease and opens his bat face at the last minute to glide it past Bairtsow"
7918,"out Caught by Bairstow!! Edged and gone. Slower balls in loop from Kumar, this was much fuller and Rahul swings blindly. Is too early into the shot and ends up nicking it to the keeper. bowler picks up his first wicket and team lose another wicket. batsman c Bairstow b bowler 10(7) [4s-2]"
7919,"SIX, oh jeez! What power from batsman. For a second, thought he mistimed it as his bottom hand came off the handle but such is the power from the big man that he still manages to deposit this 10 rows back over long-off. It was another canny slower ball from Kaul, batsman didn't pick it and threw everything at it and gets the desired result"
7920,"SIX, low full toss and batsman clouts it over cow corner. If you miss your length against batsman, he will make you pay. Kaul misses his yorker by an inch or so, batsman connects and launches it into the stands"
7921,"SIX, takes full toll. Kaul again misses the yorker, offers a juicy full toss outside off and batsman takes it on the full to smoke it over cow corner. 83-metre six, batsman is on song here"
7922,"FOUR, chipped over extra cover! Fuller and wide of off, batsman with his long levers spanks it over the in-field. It came off the cue-end but comfortably cleared the fielder"
7923,"SIX, dropped. Nabi palms it over for a maximum at deep square leg. Very sloppy, should've taken by his standards. Whipped across the line and went towards deep square leg, Nabi sprawls across and gets both hands on it, only to tip it over the ropes"
7924,"SIX, easy pickings. Picked off the pads and heaved away behind square for a sixer. Not the biggest ground and the ball went over the ropes. Little charge down the track and then the club"
7925,"FOUR, another blemish and it's a boundary. team and batsman will not mind this. Very full from Kumar, batsman clubs it down the ground. Hooda misjudges it and charges in way too early, doesn't get his body behind the line of the ball and lets it through to the boundary"
7926,"out Caught by Hooda!! Hangs the ball in the air by bowling it slower, batsman fails to control the hack and holes out at deep mid. He inner-halved the stroke and never timed it. The ball was tossed up at 82.9kph and all the power in the shot had to be invested by the batter. That is where he lost his shape trying to hit it hard and the length also was dragged back. Huge wicket for team. batsman c Hooda b bowler 11(14) [6s-1]"
7927,"FOUR, punched down the ground! Hits it on top of the bounce with the full face of the bat and beats mid-off with elan"
7928,out Lbw!! He plays such unorthodox shots but falls prey tonight. Looked to slog a slower delivery and missed it completely. The impact looked a little dicey at first but was umpire's call as batsman decided to review. team are on top now. batsman lbw b bowler 7(8) [4s-1]
7929,"FOUR, bad ball on to the pads and has been paddled away fine past short fine leg for a four"
7930,"out Caught by Hooda!! Gone! Mumbai's in-form batsman has been sent back. Front foot no-ball - check. QdK has to continue his walk back. The well-disguised knuckle ball and batsman thought it was in his slot, so he went through with the heave but the slowness didn't allow him to clear the rope, Hooda settles under it at deep mid-wicket. batsman c Hooda b bowler 19(18) [4s-1 6s-1]"
7931,"FOUR, what timing! It was just a short-arm jab on the dab and the ball races to the fence. Short of length, Kishan rides the bounce and steers it late behind point, Pathan had no chance in the deep"
7932,"FOUR, crunched through cover. Shows the kind of form he's been in this tournament. Short and fraction width provided, enough for batsman to cash in. Getting on top of the bounce and slapping it in the gap"
7933,"out Caught by Rohit!! batsman absolutely belted that but hits it straight into the hands of Rohit Sharma at mid-wicket. Sharp reflexes from Rohit though, a meter to the right or left of him would have been a boundary. But this sport is all about few centimeters. And this dismissal was just a vindication of that. It was a back of a length delivery on the stumps, batsman got a lot of willow behind the pull shot but when luck is not going your way you tend to find fielders. And that's exactly what happened there with Pandey. batsman c Rohit b bowler 16(21)"
7934,"out Caught by Ishan Kishan!! team are committing a harakiri here. They are five down now. It was a googly which was wide of off, Pathan goes down on his knees and wanted to slog-sweep over deep backwad square leg. It comes off the top-half of the bat and ballons up in the air. Ishan Kishan in the deep makes no mistake. batsman c Ishan Kishan b bowler 0(4)"
7935,"FOUR, goes on the back foot and cuts it well, beats deep backward point for a boundary. Welcome boundary for team!"
7936,"SIX, 120kph. In the back of a length zone just outside off, but batsman's happy to open up his cards early - which are the same cards he's been trying to deal with all over - backing away and then generating enough power in this lofted tonk of sorts. It looked like he only had the height on first impression, but no, the legs are there, over long-off"
7937,"out Bowled!! It was a troubled stay, and the end is just as troubling. Joseph anticipates some more shuffling extravaganza here from batsman and keeps it dead straight on middle. batsman - this time - isn't as creative, sits down trying to slog it out over cow corner. But it's too quick. Too full. Under the bat and leaving a mess behind. batsman b bowler 20(24) [4s-1]"
7938,"out Caught&Bowled!! There's the virtual nail into Hyderabad's coffin. It's quick, it's bouncy and it's into Rashid's shoulder. Poor Rashid, he didn't even get a sighter to deserve this brute. So he backs away, tries to get some bat, somehow in a weird pull of sorts. Ends up with the bat's shoulder, onto his shoulder for Joseph to run under the balloon up. batsman c and b bowler 0(1)"
7939,"out Caught by Rohit!! Remember what team did to team last year at the Wankhede? Well, this is revengeful payback. JUST AS COLD. bowler bangs it in, continues cramping batsman up for room, for height as he continues swinging desperately -- this time for the bat face to turn in his palms, get a big fat top-edge, as far as mid-off. batsman c Rohit b bowler 11(14) [6s-1]"
7940,"out Bowled!! WWWWW -- IPL debut you say! It's easier than an EA Sports Cricket '07 debut. He needed Malinga to return home, and he's perhaps even nudged him further into Sri Lanka here. So it was the same old usual stuff, full, on middle and batsman's tried funky scoop does him no good. Only uproots middle. batsman b bowler 2(6)"
7941,"FOUR, on the legs at full pace. Sharma gets a tickle, and that's all he needed to .. into fine leg"
7942,"out Caught by de Kock!! Sorry Sohail Tanvir, Joseph's knocked you out -- It's the BEST IPL figures by a bowler. EVER. And it's taken 12 years and a 22-year-old from Antigua to do it. Again, a Ripley's Believe-It-Or-Not fact, he's on debut. Hits the hard heavy back of a length just outside off, which Kaul sticks his bat out in a poke to - and the feather to the keeper will do. batsman c de Kock b bowler 0(1)"
7943,"FOUR, poor delivery from bowler and gets the punishment. Swinging into the pads of batsman, who shuffles across and flicks it with supreme timing behind square on the leg-side. There was a fielder in the deep but had no chance of stopping that"
7944,"FOUR, seems like batsman read the bowler's mind here. Expected the short delivery, went deep in his crease and cleared his front leg to mow it over mid-wicket. Vijay Shankar in the dug-out enjoyed that"
7945,"FOUR, strokes it on the rise but it beats Rohit's dive at mid-off. Fullish just outside off, batsman hammers it hard and luckily the ball teasingly evades the team skipper"
7946,"FOUR, batsman latches onto it, on this occasion. Pushed through quicker on middle, batsman took some time in getting his bat down on the heave, gets it off the inner half in the pocket between short fine leg and square leg"
7947,"out Caught by Bumrah!! No batsman show today. Perks of having a leggie in your team. Leg-spinners might go for a few runs but on most occasions will fetch you a wicket. bowler has just done that and gives team the first breakthrough. Serves the googly on a luring length outside off, batsman went for it, gets deceived by the flight and lost his shape completely. The outcome is a top-edge which spoons up to Bumrah at short third man, who takes the sitter. batsman c Bumrah b bowler 16(10) [4s-3]"
7948,"out Bowled!! Wow! First ball in IPL cricket and bowler gets one of the most successful batsmen in the history of IPL. Stuff of dreams! It was on a fuller length and was wide of off, batsman throws his bat at it in a clumsy fashion perhaps some overconfidence. It clips his inside edge and comes back to disturb his timber. batsman b bowler 15(13) [4s-2]"
7949,"1 run, Pollard drops a dolly at long-off. Can you believe it, I can't. Let me pinch myself. Yes, Pollard has dropped. It was a miscued loft from batsman, was in the air for a long time. Pollard comes under it but for some reason fails to grab it. Rohit is stunned"
7950,"FOUR, width available that time, batsman waits for it to spin and steers it wide of backward point for a boundary"
7951,"1 run, direct hit and Shankar would have been gone. batsman taps it to cover and charges for a single. Surya picks it up cleanly but fails to nail the direct hit at the striker's end. And Shankar survives!"
7952,"out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! The decision to play bowler is proving to be a masterstroke for Mumbai Indians so far. It was a back of a length delivery and was wide of off, it skids off the deck. batsman was a week late on the pull shot. It comes off the upper half of the blade and pops up in the air. Hardik Pandya at backward point won't do a Pollard. He takes a sitter of sitter. batsman c Hardik Pandya b bowler 5(10) [4s-1]"
7953,out Caught by Navdeep Saini!! Dream start for team as batsman departs for a duck. Pitches this one up and tempts the batsman to go after it. The left-handed batsman goes for a booming drive and gets an outside edge that flies to short third man. Saini is swift to move across as he plucks this one nicely before he hits the ground. The crowd is ecstatic as the Kiwi pacer strikes early. batsman c Navdeep Saini b bowler 0(1)
7954,"FOUR, should have been stopped by Chahal there. Iyer leans ahead and times his square drive to beat the leggie's dive at point. First one of the innings for Delhi and their skipper"
7955,"1 run, dropped by Parthiv! That could possibly have been the second wicket of the innings, but bowler has his hands on his head. The keeper has let him down. Iyer went for a drive away from his body as an outside edge flies straight to the keeper. Parthiv dives to his right, gets his glove to it but fails to cling on to the catch. Quite an eventful over that"
7956,"SIX, oh so very defensive. bowler continues firing them wide outside off to cut off batsman's leg-side play - square of the wicket he goes slicing, flat over extra cover"
7957,"FOUR, too short. batsman rocks behind, lining up well to allow the ball to do its bit and then cut it away really late past the keeper"
7958,"FOUR, nails the sweep. batsman gets out a big stride, and then does well to roll his wrists on the ball as he powers it away despite the slight kick up off the pitch - keeping it down and into square leg"
7959,"FOUR, chops the cut away off the back foot and gets it past the man at point for a four. team are racing away towards the target. 42 needed now. Dropped it slightly short and batsman was quick to pounce on it"
7960,"out Lbw!! What happened there? Against the run of play, team have lost batsman. Looks to play the scoop and misses it completely. The ball hits the front pad and it looked quite adjacent to the sticks. Good decision from umpire S Ravi to give it out. It looked like there might have been some bat but wasn't to be and batsman was happy to walk off. batsman lbw b bowler 22(21) [4s-2 6s-1]"
7961,"2 runs, this shortish length ain't working for team. batsman treks back, stands tall and cuts it past point for a double. That is fifty for the skipper. His first of the season. Has been a tough start for him but would want to make this count"
7962,"FOUR, fundamental error! The ball lands on the practice wickets and skids. Siraj at third man took it easy and the skid off the ground had enough pace to burst through the hands of the fielder. batsman picked up the short ball and slashed it for the ball to race away off the outer-half of the bat"
7963,"FOUR, fetches the length ball from outside off and drags the sweep away into the on-side. The ball raced away square of the wicket on the on-side for a four. Didn't time it but had enough on it for a single"
7964,"FOUR, terrible delivery and has been put away. batsman rocked back and allowed the bat flow to take over and cut it past point. The man at deep cover had no chance"
7965,"SIX, well looped up delivery and has been smacked down the ground. Only a shot away now are the Capitals from investing in a win. Poor delivery again from bowler and batsman was in no mood to let that go away"
7966,out Caught by Chahal!! The short ball gets big on him and the top-edge has been taken at cover. That was a close call for the bowler as he almost was on the line while delivering it but a dew millimetres saved him. A wicket too late in the evening for team. The formalities have been delayed. batsman c Chahal b bowler 67(50) [4s-8 6s-2]
7967,out Caught by de Villiers!! Slammed on the up and it finds the man at mid-off. That was a back of a length delivery and batsman tried to flat-bat it but ended up finding ABD at mid-off. Soft dismissal. batsman c de Villiers b bowler 0(3)
7968,"out Caught by Southee!! Cross-seam length ball and has been slapped straight to the man at mid-off. Pretty much like Morris, batsman also tried to power the ball down the ground but ended up hitting it straight to the fielder at mid-off. Still 3 needed. Some atrocious batting from team again. batsman c Southee b bowler 18(14) [4s-2]"
7969,"FOUR, and those are the winning runs! Stand and deliver. Length delivery decking away, batsman lifts the ball over the in-field and gets it away to the fence for a four to complete the formalities"
7970,"FOUR, that's a good shot by Shaw. Has timed the ball nicely so far. Gets one overpitched dolly on the pads and he makes sure to put it away to the deep mid-wicket fence with a flick"
7971,"FOUR, back-to-back boundaries for the youngster. Gets one short ball down the leg side and Shaw drags it past the fielder at short fine leg. Kohli's expressions say it all, not a great line to bowl"
7972,"FOUR, shawt! Width on offer and no great pace either, batsman reaches out for it and slaps it through cover-point. Hat-trick of boundaries for the opener"
7973,"FOUR, make it four in a row. Exhibition of stroke play by Shaw. Short ball well outside off and the batsman plays an exquisite square cut. No chance of stopping that, neither for the fielder at point, nor for the fielder at third man"
7974,"leg byes, FOUR, from bad to worse. 20 runs of the over already. Short ball around leg, batsman tries to flick it away but the ball clips his pads instead and races away to the fine leg fence"
7975,"FOUR, doesn't matter where the field is when you're bowling full tosses. Shaw stands deep in his crease, swinging with a lot of bottom-hand to whack it straight down the ground"
7976,"FOUR, hard slog across the line. Doesn't pick it cleanly, dragging it in the end only off the inside half of his bat .. the powerplay and Southee's chasing dive can't stop it from trickling into cow corner"
7977,"SIX, big jump down the pitch, and a bigger bat swing. It really looked a miscued slice at first, but there's enough bottom handed power, and Chinnaswamy isn't the biggest to get it to sail over the sightscreen"
7978,"FOUR, just too easy. Strays down leg, and then refuses to turn back in. But Iyer turns on his heel, swivelling big to heave it away fine"
7979,"FOUR, 144.7kph. Damn, violence. Iyer anticipates the back of a length sitter with a lot of width outside off and backs away further to free up his hands as he slices a flashy cut into an empty backward point zone"
7980,"out Caught by Akshdeep Nath!! The juicy long hop does what a bunch of tight lines couldn't. bowler drags his length back, and Shaw's eyes light up in a big agricultural mow getting deep in the crease. However, gets a big fat top-edge, and Akshdeep at cow corner, after all the initial misjudgement is sitting under. batsman c Akshdeep Nath b bowler 28(22) [4s-5]"
7981,"FOUR, continues backing away in the crease, giving his arms the free-up space and slaps, hard, through point"
7982,"FOUR, cheekily experimental. An early premeditated lapped-scoop on realizing that there's no short fine leg, and Iyer doesn't mind walking all the way across his stumps if he has to. Doesn't find the middle, but the ballooning miscue is just as good"
7983,"FOUR, lovely, Parthiv is the man in form for team, length ball on the pads, he gets inside the line and clips it over mid-wicket, couple of bounces and over the ropes"
7984,"FOUR, edged and four, Dhawan was the fielder at wide slip - dived to his right, but the ball was just wide of him. An awkward jab from batsman as he pushed away from his body, didn't count for the extra bounce"
7985,"out Caught by Rahul Tewatia!! Gone! One thing you can't do on a slow track is play the pull. Remember team's first game? Kohli and AB getting out playing the pull. This was short alright but the surface robs the pace off the ball, batsman pulls it straighter than he would have liked and picks out long-on. Good catch from Tewatia - he ran forward and pouched the flat hit. batsman c Rahul Tewatia b bowler 15(17) [6s-1]"
7986,"SIX, it was a matter of time before Mo took on one of these two. He brings out the dancing shoes, gets close to the flighted delivery and smokes it with the spin over the cow corner fence"
7987,"SIX, second time team have hit a maximum right after the time out. Back of a length delivery and on a slow surface it was a hit-me ball, Mo swivels back and nails the pull flat over deep mid-wicket"
7988,"FOUR, wow! Mo has just squeezed a yorker for a boundary. The only thing wrong on bowler's part is - it was outside off, Mo bends down, opens the bat face and squeezes it past backward point"
7989,"SIX, change of ends for bowler and he's greeted in the same way as he was in his first over. Mo jumps out of the crease, gets close to the googly and smacks it flat over long-off"
7990,"out Stumped!! And bowler has his man.. Brave bowling from the youngster. He was not afraid to toss it up even after getting hit for a six. It was the wrong 'un and Mo could not reach the pitch of the ball, still swings through the line and is beaten by the away turn. A nice little cameo but team needed more than a cameo here. batsman st Pant b bowler 32(18) [4s-1 6s-3]"
7991,"FOUR, cheeky! First ball and Akshdeep is down on his knee to play the paddle, uses the pace on the ball and places it fine, the lightning fast outfield took care of the rest"
7992,"FOUR, it was boom or bust for Akshdeep with three dots, he decides it is the latter. Charges down and converts it into a full length delivery, cracks the drive past extra cover and there was no stopping that"
7993,"FOUR, good effort by Morris, but in vain. batsman was down the wicket to chip this widish delivery to long-off. Morris sprints across, gets his hands to it but his knee gets stuck in the turf, hence he fails to stop it cleanly"
7994,"SIX, finally! Finally, a sweetly timed shot by VK! Down on his knee in a jiffy as he pumps the floated delivery over deep mid-wicket for a flat six"
7995,"SIX, it's batsman time at the Chinnaswamy. The decibels have got a notch higher. Treks back and pulls the short ball over deep mid-wicket. Two in two for the skipper as the ball just clears the fence"
7996,"out Caught by Shreyas Iyer!! bowler comes back in the attack and strikes. How often do we see that? Got de Villiers earlier, gets another big wicket now. A length delivery around off and batsman holes out to long-on as he looks to clear the fence this time around. batsman c Shreyas Iyer b bowler 41(33) [4s-1 6s-2]"
7997,"FOUR, cheeky shot by Akshdeep! Waits for the ball to arrive, opens the bat face very late and guides it to the third man fence. With that pace, it was always going to race away to the fence"
7998,out Caught by Pant!! bowler has bagged three wickets now! Akshdeep was looking to play a similar shot. Opens his bat face late and guides this one straight to Rishabh Pant. Got a boundary on the previous ball but the same shot has brought about in his downfall. Can bowler take a five-wicket haul? batsman c Pant b bowler 19(12) [4s-4]
7999,"out Caught by Pant!! Superb over by bowler! Claims his third wicket of the over as batsman perishes for a golden duck. A short ball around off, batsman tries to scoop it over the keeper but all he can manage is a feather to it. Pant leaps, gets his glove to it initially and takes it on the second attempt. All of sudden, there is pin drop silence at the stadium. batsman c Pant b bowler 0(1)"
8000,"out Lbw!! batsman has been adjudged lbw and he has decided to challenge the umpire's call. This probably is hitting the leg-stump, hence the batsman will have to walk back to the pavilion. Three reds and another wicket goes down. batsman was trying to play a cheeky scoop shot, gets struck on the pads instead. Pitching in line, impact on leg and hitting the leg stump. Dead. batsman lbw b bowler 1(5)"
8001,"out Caught by Lamichhane!! The extra ball has got Morris a wicket - this was full and this was wide of off - Parthiv's eyes lit up as he saw the width, went hard on the slash, gets a thick edge and the ball is swallowed by Lamichhane - running in from third man. Parthiv walks off to loud cheers and that's because the new man is AB. batsman c Lamichhane b bowler 9(9) [4s-1]"
8002,"SIX, cracking shot, that might get AB going, banged in short and just outside off, in the zone for AB as he pulls it over mid-wicket, went sailing over the ropes for a maximum"
8003,"1 run, a direct hit at the bowler's end and AB would have been running to the pavilion. It was his call after he drove it straight to mid-off. The fielder had time to shy and then missed, AB was a long way away from safety had he hit"
8004,"FOUR, lovely, more of the AB we know and love of the past - back of a length and just outside off, not a bad ball by any means, AB comes down the track, makes room and cracks it square past cover-point - Two men dived, but the ball split them expertly"
8005,"out Caught by Ingram!! The extra ball has got the Capitals another wicket - AB was been done in by his fellow countryman - the slower ball from bowler, think AB spotted it as he looked to go back over the bowler's head - didn't get hold of the shot as much as he would have liked - was in the air for a long time and a third South African - Colin Ingram - completes the catch even as he ran back from mid-on. batsman c Ingram b bowler 17(16) [4s-1 6s-1]"
8006,"SIX, welcome, Mr. bowler. First ball and batsman puts it into the last tier. Flighted on middle, batsman clears his front leg and swings it cleanly to send it sailing over long-on. Kohli enjoyed it at the other end"
8007,"FOUR, french-cut! Drags back the length, does Dhawal and Lynn goes ahead with a pull shot. Gets an inside edge that rockets past the stumps and races away to the fine leg fence"
8008,"FOUR, second boundary of the over! Short and wide outside off, batsman reaches out for it and slaps it past the diving fielder at cover. Once it's past the ring it's always going to be a boundary with such a quick outfield"
8009,"FOUR, easy pickings for batsman! This was a flatter delivery on the pads and the southpaw flicks it past the fielder at short fine leg, nicely placed shot that"
8010,"SIX, a flashback of bowler against batsman. Remember that night in 2018? A tossed up delivery, touch short in length and it's been clubbed over deep mid-wicket by the opener, six runs"
8011,"FOUR, expensive over so far... Floated around middle and leg, batsman picks it over square leg and adds four more to his tally. That's the only way he plays"
8012,"FOUR, another mediocre delivery by bowler. Drifts this one on the pads and batsman gets it over square leg with a nonchalant flick, the home crowd is loving this even though the Royals are getting belted here"
8013,"SIX, and that has crashed into the demonstration car! Went down on to his knees and slammed the slog sweep flat out of the ground. Cliched but was Lynntastic"
8014,"1 run, and that might have been an outer edge! Kept low and went between the keeper's legs for a single. Fifty for Lynn. He has set it up for team for a big win. Needed this knock to bolster his confidence as well"
8015,out Caught by S Midhun!! Top-edge on the sweep and is taken by the man at deep backward square leg. You live by the sword and you die by it as well. The sweep had been beneficial for him but this time the top-edge was found and was taken by the fielder coming in. Easy take in the end. batsman c S Midhun b bowler 50(32) [4s-6 6s-3]
8016,"SIX, dropped too short - it's the scarred scared bowling - and batsman piles on with a rock behind, a front-leg clear and a heave into cow corner"
8017,"SIX, bang in the arc. batsman won't let the rhyme go wrong, he'll tonk it out of the park. Short, full, short .. and yes, too full - which batsman gets slightly inside the line to and lofts it behind the sightscreen"
8018,"leg byes, FOUR, the pad-tickles will do just as well. bowler slips in radar and Gill would feel he's missed out on some free runs here, missing the glance, but his pads take it fine enough"
8019,"FOUR, 22 runs of bowler's opening over! The required run rate is down to 6 within a span of 6 deliveries. batsman treks back and chips the short ball over the infield at wide mid-off"
8020,"FOUR, has been the Lynn and Narine show so far! Short in length and width on offer, the batsman reaches out and carves it past the fielder at square third man, four more for the right hander"
8021,"1 run, Tripathi has dropped a sitter and Kulkarni can't believe it. Got deceived due to the slower delivery as he was early in his chip. The ball was in the air for an eternity and Tripathi, at point, had all the time to get under it. Gets his hands to it and spills it out"
8022,"FOUR, can you believe this? Dhawal could have had two wickets in two deliveries, but the wicket column reads zero. Lynn had got an inside edge that richocheted on to the stumps and raced to the fine leg fence thereafter. Happened with Dhoni a couple of days back as the bails didn't move. Lynn had even started walking but according to the law he survives. His night, probably"
8023,"FOUR, short and punished! Was a slower delivery and Lynn hacks it over mid-wicket. Four more to the opener who was somewhat deceived due to the lack of pace and was early in his shot"
8024,"SIX, that's nailed over long-on, 50-run stand up. Also the fastest team fifty in IPL 2019. Lynn puts on his dancing shoes and thumps the short ball over the fence, just clears it"
8025,"FOUR, in the air but it's in the gap too. batsman had slogged the length delivery towards cow corner but the fielders were stationed at long-on and deep mid-wicket. Neither of them could reach as the ball found the fence"
8026,"FOUR, nothing's going right for Dhawal Kulkarni. Attempts another slower delivery and batsman bludgeons it over mid-on. Had enough elevation to clear the fielder stationed inside the ring"
8027,"SIX, batsman moves into the 40s in style. Goes down on his knee and lifts the tossed up delivery over deep square leg. Clears the fence comfortably for his second maximum of the night. Time for a new ball as it's disappeared in the crowd"
8028,"SIX, deposited over deep mid-wicket! Latches on to the floated delivery and slogs it over the fence for six more. The required run rate is just over 4.5 at the moment"
8029,"SIX, it's raining sixes in Jaipur. Lynn gets hold of it and slogsweeps it over deep square leg for another massive six"
8030,"out Caught by Smith!! The googly gets the powerhitter here. Slashes at the away going ball and ends up edging it. The slip fielder had to react quickly and he did so to pouch it. team have finally something worth celebrating. It was supposed to be a tough wicket to bat on but batsman had other ideas tonight. Going back to that ball, it was slightly flatter that googly. batsman c Smith b bowler 47(25) [4s-6 6s-3]"
8031,"FOUR, was a flighted ball and batsman got to the pitch of the ball to slam the drive past cover. Was hit well enough for the ball to race through to the fence"
8032,"FOUR, drops the ball short and has been cut away. More of an outer-edge on the cut and that was well away from the man at slip for a four. Tripathi had no chance this time"
8033,"FOUR, lovely, tossed up just outside off, batsman went down on his knee, played with the spin and swiped it over mid-wicket, one bounce and over the ropes"
8034,"out Lbw!! Loud shout for LBW and batsman decides against a review. A little bit of a nibble and batsman was caught right in front. On a good length and shaping back in, batsman was shuffling across on the tuck, gets beaten on the inside edge and is struck around the knee-roll - adjacent to middle and leg, was going on to crash into the top of middle-stump and umpire Gaffaney has an easy call to make. batsman has a chat with his partner and off he goes. batsman lbw b bowler 5(7) [4s-1]"
8035,"FOUR, edged and four. The googly with some extra bite, batsman was taken aback by the bounce and tried to withdraw his bat, but the outside edge had already been found and it raced away fine"
8036,"FOUR, read the batsman changing his grip and fired in a quicker delivery at 107ks, batsman still adjusted and reverse swept it past a diving Lynn at backward point. It was a tentative dive from the Australian"
8037,"SIX, will this get batsman going? team will hope it does. bowler drops the slower delivery short and gives time for batsman to pick his spot, pulled over deep square leg and that is the first maximum of the day"
8038,"out Caught by Shubman Gill!! Nope. He's gone. Maiden IPL wicket for bowler. He sends back his fellow countryman. The slower delivery which is fuller than the previous one, batsman targets cow corner this time, but he was hitting against the wind and to the longest part of the ground, only succeeded in getting it to Gill at the edge of the rope. batsman c Shubman Gill b bowler 37(34) [4s-5 6s-1]"
8039,"FOUR, expertly played! The off-cutter on a shortish length and moreover batsman had the width, he back cuts it behind point and Narine never looked like getting to the ball"
8040,"FOUR, fifty for batsman. He is the key for team if they have to get a good total. Has played himself in and now has the hang of the surface. Waits for the slower delivery, shuffles across and pulls it backward of square leg"
8041,"out Caught by Chawla!! Never easy for a new batsman to play his shots on this surface. Till now Tripathi was just nudging around but it was time for him to go. Takes on bowler's slower ball and can only sky the loft straight up, plenty of air time and Chawla settles under it near cover. batsman c Chawla b bowler 6(8)"
8042,"1 run, a certain chance has gone down here..pushed the googly into the off-side and set off. The man at cover rushed in, had a flick on to the sticks but missed it. batsman survives"
8043,"SIX, and boom! That has gone into the orbit. Charged out and muscled it over deep mid for a sixer. Huge hit"
8044,"FOUR, edged and runs! Four of them. Yorkerish delivery outside off, batsman squeezes it out and the ball flies away past the dive of the keeper for a four"
8045,"FOUR, and finally a four! Smart play from the Aussie. Was a full ball, batsman opened the bat face and placed it in the gap between short third and point"
8046,"FOUR, lovely, the wrong 'un from bowler, but the length is way too short, allows batsman to go back and whip it behind square on the on-side - no one in the deep and the ball runs away to the ropes"
8047,"FOUR, nicely played, batsman was so quick in reading bowler's slower ball, prods across and clips it in front of square on the on-side - beats mid-wicket and runs away to the ropes"
8048,"FOUR, lovely, this is batsman at his best, length ball outside off, he's quick to move across and then paddles it towards the vacant fine leg region, one bounce and over the ropes"
8049,"FOUR, cracking shot, much needed for the Royals, dropped short and spinning back into the right-hander, batsman waited on it and then cut it late - beat backward point and raced away to the fence"
8050,"FOUR, much needed boundary for batsman. He was feeling the pressure. Waits for the flighted delivery to land and reverse sweeps it over backward point, came right off the meat as it raced away"
8051,"FOUR, shot! He picked the wrong 'un and though he was hitting against the spin, he was in complete control. Went down on his knee, rolled his wrists and broomed it to deep square leg"
8052,"1 run, another slower delivery and batsman is happy with a push down the ground, 50-run stand up"
8053,"FOUR, there he goes - the enforecer - clearing out his front leg, not quite getting hold of his rather agricultural hoick, but his biceps will do it, get it over the mid-wicket infield"
8054,"FOUR, driven on the up and the length ball disappears into the deep cover fence. Climbed into the delivery and hit it on top of the bounce to get it between cover and mid-off"
8055,"FOUR, picked his spot and pulled it away! Short ball, was chest high and batsman pulled it with a lot of disdain. One bounce and into the fence. Man at deep mid had no chance"
8056,"SIX, that is the delivery service from batsman we all know of. Picks a length ball and delivers it over long-off for a sixer. The bowler went a bit towards the body of the batter but batsman timed it well enough to get it over the fence"
8057,"FOUR, deft touch from batsman! Spotted the length of this flat delivery early and opened the bat face at the last minute to guide it past Bairstow's gloves fine of third man"
8058,"FOUR, fifty for KL batsman! His third in his last four games. Jumps out of his crease and hacks the flat delivery wide of long-on, Manish Pandey runs across and dives but couldn't only manage a fingertip on that"
8059,"2 runs, that was in the air for an eternity and Yusuf Pathan drops an absolute dolly. Short outside off, Mayank skewed it up off the toe-end as he went for the carve over point, Pathan at sweeper cover had ample time and he indeed was on his knees trying to grab it near his chest. Straight in and straight out"
8060,"2 runs, opens the bat face and punches the length ball wide of deep extra cover, brings up the 100-run partnersnip too"
8061,"SIX, team have gone after Siddarth Kaul from his first over and they aren't holding back now either. Was on a length and Mayank had ample room to free his arms outside off, transfers his weight onto the back foot and pumps it high and over the long-off fence"
8062,"1 run, 5th IPL fifty for Mayank batsman! Gets there with a tickle off his pads through square leg"
8063,"FOUR, thwacked from the crease. No feet. Just stand and deliver: pumps the length ball to the right of long-off and Manish Pandey does well to flick the ball back while on the move. He, however, took a brief while to regather his momentum and by that time the ball had rolled back to kiss the boundary hoardings. Unlucky!"
8064,"out Caught by Shankar!! Mayank perishes trying to seal things early. Slower short ball outside off, was dug into the pitch with plenty of effort, and therefore Mayank's ill-timed pull shot couldn't clear the ropes. Straight down the throat of Vijay Shankar at deep mid-wicket ala Manish Pandey's dismissal. batsman c Shankar b bowler 55(43) [4s-3 6s-3]"
8065,"out Caught by Hooda!! Another greedy dismissal. Knuckle ball bowled a shade outside off stump, batsman doesn't pick the variation and lofts it high into the night sky, Hooda had a week's time before catching that around his throat at long-on. Easy! batsman c Hooda b bowler 1(3)"
8066,"out Caught by Hooda!! Excellent final over from Sid Kaul. Kept his composure and bowled a slower full ball outside off asking batsman to take a risk from there, Mandy obliges and goes for the smack over long-off. Doesn't quite get the elevation and Hooda claims his third catch of the game. Did well to run a few yards to his left from long-off. batsman c Hooda b bowler 2(3)"
8067,"FOUR, flat and full on off, batsman hammers it straight and got enough power to beat the diving fielder at long-off. Crowd going bonkers now"
8068,"SIX, 138.1kph. It's the good length with batsman in the slog mode. He steps away, frees up his hands and lofts the flat-batted tonk over long-on"
8069,"out Caught by Hooda!! They've played with his ego, and batsman's fallen right into it. A leg-breaking skidder in the slot inviting batsman to go over long-on. He does just that, gets it flat, but with the lofted drive coming off the inside half. And Hooda steals the show, spotting it quickly from a wide long-on and sliding under it in front of the sightscreen. The show's over boys. batsman c Hooda b bowler 16(14) [4s-1 6s-1]"
8070,"FOUR, quicker slider in the slot, and batsman's already taken his front leg out of the way to drill it uppishly down the ground"
8071,"FOUR, 138.4kph. Too full, batsman does well going inside-out with his slice over backward point .. but Kaul runs across from third man, gets the slide in as well, but probably ends up slipping with the dew, slipping all over it"
8072,"SIX, rank sitter. batsman holds his pose, holds his shape and decides to time it out of here - rocking behind and playing it with the straightest of bats as he punches it straight down, flush"
8073,"FOUR, just doesn't give out any pace to work around with, but batsman has enough of his own. Making some room, and going back in the crease to pile on the drag down as he slaps it damn violently through extra cover"
8074,"SIX, quickly down a knee and there's no missing about. Slogs. Holding his pose as he goes through with the swing in depositing it long and deep into cow corner. Shankar, fielding at the fence does try but ends up parrying it over"
8075,"FOUR, wow! That was a superb shot. High elbow in combination with a still head helps the ball to speed past the dive of the man at mid-off. Pitched up delivery and batsman hit it on top of the bounce to thread it through"
8076,"1 run, stabs the ball out with soft hands into the off-side and gets a single. Fifty of the partnership comes up as well"
8077,"out Caught by Ashwin!! Big wicket! It is not swing but spin that breaks this dangerous pair. The carrom ball drifts in and batsman wanted to clip it off the pads, he does not keep it down the ground and Ashwin at mid-wicket takes a good low catch. He dived forward and scooped it inches off the ground. batsman c Ashwin b bowler 1(6)"
8078,"FOUR, finally a boundary for Hyderabad! All about timing, this shot was. A floated and full delivery and the batsman chips it straight to long-on. The fielder in the deep was a touch square, hence he couldn't cut this down"
8079,"out Caught by Rahul!! bowler strikes! Bowls a carrom ball in the channel outside off, batsman looks to slice it but all he can manage is a feather to it. Sharp catch by Rahul and the gritty partnership has been broken. Probably a blessing in disguise for the batting team as the pair was consuming too many deliveries. batsman c Rahul b bowler 26(27) [4s-2]"
8080,"FOUR, that's a rare loose delivery by Punjab tonight. bowler darts this one outside off on a shorter length and batsman makes the use of the width on offer. Reaches out for it and slices it past the fielder at point. No fielders in the deep and that shall be the second boundary of the over"
8081,"FOUR, nicely done by Davey! Premeditates and puts this straighter delivery away to the deep point fence with a well timed reverse sweep"
8082,out Nabi Run Out!! That's a fine effort by bowler as he's ran Nabi out. batsman had smashed the short ball back to the bowler and bowler stops it with his right hand. Nabi was backing away and he was miles outside his crease. bowler parries the ball on to the stumps and the Afghan all-rounder is gone. Nabi run out (bowler) 12(7)
8083,"FOUR, short ball down the leg side and batsman drags it past the fielder at short fine leg, sends it to the fence and adds four more to his tally"
8084,"SIX, first six of the innings! It comes in the 16th over. Better late, than never. batsman makes room and thumps the fullish delivery right over the bowler's head. Straight into the sightscreen and that's a maximum"
8085,"2 runs, another fifty for batsman! Has been a very gritty knock as he hasn't been at his fluent best. Reaches out for this widish delivery as he drives it to deep cover. Takes two runs and gets to the landmark but there are no real celebrations. His job ain't done yet"
8086,"FOUR, backs away and blasts it past mid-off for a four. That was on a length, batsman backed away, created room and allowed his hands to do the needful"
8087,"FOUR, backs across, gives away and swords the ball past point for a four. Much needed boundaries these for team. The run rate getting a facelift here. Poor length again from bowler"
8088,"FOUR, slower length delivery and jhas been upper steered away past the short third fielder for a four. Was preempted and despite that being a slower ball, batsman managed to usher enough pace on to the shot to get it past the fielder. Cheeky Pandey"
8089,"1 run, the partnership between batsman and Manish Pandey is now 50. Lowish full toss on the pads. The best that batsman can do is whip it away to deep mid for a single"
8090,"FOUR, and a good ball but a bad result. Squeezed through the third man region for a four. Got bat to ball and almost an educated edge to put it fine past short third for a four. 11 off the over. 31 runs off the 3 last overs"
8091,"out Caught by (sub)Nair!! The field was set for the short stuff and it has worked. batsman despite waiting on the back foot could not place the pull past the man at deep mid, who hardly moved to cup that. Short ball bereft of room and the pull despite being decently timed wasn't placed in the gap. batsman c (sub)Nair b bowler 19(15) [4s-2]"
8092,"FOUR, walks across his sticks and tickles the ball away fine. Perfect ball but batsman managed to get enough bat on it to peel the ball away fine. bowler almost went up in an appeal before realizing that it was off the bat"
8093,"FOUR, brilliant shot! Straight drive down the ground. Back past the bowler and it was a four. Was full and batsman nailed it"
8094,"FOUR, overpitched and batsman puts it away. bowler overcooks the flighted delivery and offers width as well, batsman bends his back knee and creams the drive through extra cover. He did well to pierce the crowded field"
8095,"SIX, 1 off the first 3 balls and 14 off the next 3. T20 cricket for you. Low full toss and batsman climbed into it. Smoked it over long-off for a sixer. Much needed finish as they scale 150"
8096,"1 run, close! Shortens the length and batsman taps it to the left of backward point, Miller has a shy at the striker's end and he misses, Warner might have been in trouble there"
8097,"FOUR, that might just ease batsman. Full and on the stumps, batsman stays back but leans forward and clips it wide of mid-on, Ashwin's dive is not good enough to stop the ball and it races away"
8098,"FOUR, proper half volley. That's no hard work for batsman, just cruising through the line and drilling it through deep extra cover"
8099,"SIX, dragged down short. batsman is quick to pile in, rocking behind, making it look all the more worse and pulling it away, high, long, into cow corner"
8100,"FOUR, this was probably the first quicker one from bowler, it was on a fuller length. And batsman goes down on his knees and slog-sweeps it wide of deep mid-wicket for a boundary"
8101,"2 runs, and action immediately after the break! Krishna at deep cover drops it. Came charging in, got to it but fluffed it. batsman takes two. Was the leggie and the inside out shot scaled more height than distance"
8102,"out Caught by Nitish Rana!! Goes for the slog sweep, gets a top-edge and Rana at short cover calls for it and takes it. That was unneccesary. May be at the break they decided one of them will go for it but this hasn't worked for team. Is the game still alive? Too tough for team. batsman c Nitish Rana b bowler 21(31) [4s-2]"
8103,"FOUR, whatta start! Gets a flighted ball outside off and has been lifted over cover for a four. That was unexpected. First ball and he went for it"
8104,"FOUR, low full toss and slapped over cover for a four. Few bounces and into the fence. Stayed steady and slammed it"
8105,"FOUR, waits on it and pulls it down past short fine leg for a four. Drops it short and slow, batsman stayed still and waited on it before pulling it past the fielder. Only 6 runs needed now"
8106,"FOUR, quick legs. And quicker hands. bowler starts short with an off-break spinning into leg-stump, giving batsman ample time to go deep in his crease and punch it away as he splits the two men on the off-side"
8107,"out Caught by Chawla!! The bonus off a half-tracker. bowler produces another sitting up off-spinner, but that manages to confuse Watto whether to go uppishly or keep it along the floor. Ends up doing a bit of both, dragging it in the end and picking out square leg perfectly. batsman c Chawla b bowler 17(9) [4s-2 6s-1]"
8108,"SIX, bang in the arc, batsman obliges it out of the park. Does well to stay inside the line and free up his hands to tonk it into his own dug-out at long-off"
8109,"FOUR, vintage. Typical. Backs away, makes a lot of room and slices it inside-out over cover. Timing, placement don't really get better"
8110,"out Caught by Chawla!! In the air and taken. Brilliant catch by PC, he charged back from mid-on, kept his eye on the ball and takes a beauty. It was a flighted delivery wide of off, batsman wanted to loft it over long-on, it comes off the bottom half of the willow and goes a long way up in the air. And PC there did exactly what the team wanted him to do in the outfield. batsman c Chawla b bowler 14(13) [4s-1 6s-1]"
8111,"FOUR, batsman makes full use of the free-hit, he picks up the slower one early, gets himself in a good position and tonks it wide of deep mid-wicket for a boundary. This should get him going"
8112,"FOUR, bowler is guilty of providing width on this one, batsman delays his bat swing and cuts it wide of backward point for a boundary"
8113,"5 runs, direct hit would have taken out batsman! Rayudu the man at mid-on but he can't get it on target and what's worse, there is nobody backing up. Races away to the extra cover fence. Bonus runs for team. Was worked softly with a straightish bat but it was a risky run and batsman is lucky to survive"
8114,"out Lbw!! bowler draws first blood! Was getting the ball to shape inwards and Lynn was never going to die wondering irrespective of the surface. Sits back to this nip backer and goes for an agricultural slog, only to miss it altogether. Past the inside edge and raps him on the back leg. Looked quite plumb in real time and I don't think a review would have saved Lynn. Hence, he walks back to the hut. batsman lbw b bowler 0(5)"
8115,"out Caught by Chahar!! bowler has the last laugh! He is just too good on such surfaces and you can't just slog him away, which is what batsman does to spinners anyway. Used his feet early and made room but bowler cleverly dragged the length back with no pace whatsoever. The result is a miscue that bobbles over the backward point region and Chahar trekked back to take a good tumbling catch. Both the openers sent back to the hut really early. batsman c Chahar b bowler 6(5)"
8116,"out Stumped!! Oh goodness! Has he got another one? Has MSD pulled off a stumping here? bowler is already celebrating and yes, Gill has started to walk. team in complete disarry now with six down. It was the googly from bowler, such deception that Gill is foxed by the spin. Goes searching for the drive away from his body and doesn't read it at all. It beats his inside edge and overbalances himself by dragging his back leg out of his crease. MSD was quick to spot it and whips the bails off in a flash. No need to go upstairs as well. team all over team like a rash. batsman st Dhoni b bowler 9(12)"
8117,"SIX, muscled over cow corner. Russell has seen enough, clears his front leg and whacks it with ferocity across the line. It goes sailing over the ropes at deep mid-wicket"
8118,"no run, oh dear, Bhajji makes a mess of this skier. Stunned faces in the crowd, they can't believe it. Uff! This is a costly miss, can't give a lifeline to someone like Russell. What have you done Bhajji? Phew. Slower and tempted Russell, who clears his front leg and aims a biggie across the line, totally miscue and sends it into the night sky. Bhajji at mid-wicket steadies himself, it was swirling in the air for a long time and he makes a meal of it. So much so that he doesn't even get a hand on it as it lobs behind him. He sort of lost his balance and slipped over"
8119,"SIX, clubbed over deep mid-wicket. batsman takes on bowler, gets underneath it and slams it powerfully over cow corner"
8120,"1 run, Jaddu nearly took a blinder at deep mid-wicket. Very hard to call this a drop but Russell continues to ride his luck. Banged in short outside off, Russell stays back and pulls it hard towards deep mid-wicket. Jadeja was a few yards inside the ropes, sees the ball sailing over his head so he backtracks and uses his one hand to keep it on. The momentum was taking him over the ropes, so he couldn't quite cling onto it. But certainly saved some runs for his team. Brilliant from Jaddu"
8121,"FOUR, short again and Russell pulls it in the gap this time. Backed himself, stayed deep in his crease and puts it in the gap between deep square leg and deep mid-wicket"
8122,"FOUR, that's crunched past long-off. Loopy low full toss, Russell makes a bit of room and frees his arms to slap it firmly down the ground. Long-off had no chance"
8123,"no run, lands the leggie on leg-stump, Russell's head was falling away as he was looking to flick. It grips and turns past his blade to knock him on the pad. bowler went up straightaway but umpire Chettithody Shamshuddin was spot on with his call as the ball was spinning too much and eventually missed the off-stump by a few inches"
8124,"out Stumped!! The wheels are coming off for team. Another one goes and bowler picks up his second wicket. Saw the batsman skip out, so Bhajji smartly slowed it up and pulled his length in addition to getting some spin off the deck. batsman was nowhere near the pitch and flashed his bat in vain after getting beaten by the flight. MSD collects it and breaks the stumps. Easy stumping and team on top. batsman st Dhoni b bowler 8(13) [6s-1]"
8125,"out batsman Run Out!! Kuldeep has been dismissed off his first ball. Mix-up between both batsmen and Kuldeep was not even in the frame there. Gee! Another one bites the dust. Flighted outside off, Kuldeep pokes it to backward point and Russell wanted a single. Kuldeep was ball-watching and was late to kick-start. The fielder collects the ball and fires a throw to the bowler, who takes the bails off to catch the batsman short of his crease. batsman run out (Rayudu/bowler) 0(1)"
8126,"out Caught by Harbhajan!! Kolkata are dominos and Harbhajan - if not pushing them out on his own, continues having himself in some form or the other on the scorecard. This time, courtesy a lame flick uppishly off his legs, picking out a funky silly mid-on perfectly. batsman c Harbhajan b bowler 0(2)"
8127,"FOUR, 110.2kph. Slow, short, spinning in. Russell clears out his front leg, very agriculturally in a murdering heave through mid-wicket"
8128,"SIX, yup, a smoke. bowler continues keeping it on a good length, and this time Russell connects, slogging, getting a slight top-edge, but those biceps have been good enough to clear most ropes, so what is Jadeja's diving there now at long-on? .."
8129,"SIX, never mind those wrists, Russell will forget them for a second. He continues his love affair with cow corner, swatting it hard, flat and several rows back"
8130,"FOUR, another muscled heave. It couldn't have gone quicker through square leg, where Rayudu tries his best to leap up on the bounce and pull it back into play, but no, such is the momentum on this that even his palm-ricochet has the legs to roll over"
8131,out Caught by Rayudu!! Sharp stuff from Rayudu! team are falling apart quite early here. The shot selection is going awry at the moment. This was slightly short but not much bounce as Rana looked to whip this away aerially on the leg-side. Didn't get the required timing as it dipped on short mid-wicket where Rayudu took a really sharp catch. batsman c Rayudu b bowler 0(3)
8132,"FOUR, and it'll end with another. Russell - like he has been all season - continues to be the lone hand, getting under another pretty full delivery and still manages to generate a lot of bottom-handed power to drill it straight back, beating long-off as well .. 108 it will be"
8133,"FOUR, edged but doesn't carry and beats first slip! bowler is getting some bite off the pitch, got this to spin away sharply but batsman did well to play with soft hands. Hence, the edge fell short of Watto and beat him as well to the fence. Bhajji gave chase but in vain"
8134,"FOUR, uppish but just through the gap! Was a 'hit me' ball from bowler, shortish with width on it but batsman didn't want to keep the cut down. Not a wise thing on this pitch but he got it in the gap"
8135,"FOUR, fab shot! More authority this time from batsman who sat back to the half-tracker and nailed the pull comfortably over mid-on"
8136,"out Caught by Kedar Jadhav!! Outrageous shot from batsman! Was looking in good touch but just when he should have started to kick on, falls to a terrible stroke. Despite a deep mid-wicket in place, he goes for the aerial pull off the shortish length ball that had no pace at all. Gets it off the top half of the blade and it's a rather easy catch for Jadhav stationed there, precisely for this kind of a stroke. It's one-way traffic in Chepauk at the moment. team don't seem to have turned up yet. batsman c Kedar Jadhav b bowler 11(9) [4s-2]"
8137,"FOUR, good shot! Fraction short and this time batsman sits deep in the crease for the cut. Beats the diving point fielder and it races away"
8138,"FOUR, oh risky but it's come off for batsman. Preempts, gets down low and paddles it. Nutmegs Dhoni and runs away to the fine leg fence. It skimmed the under-edge but it's DK's pet shot, so he earns a boundary"
8139,"out Caught by Harbhajan!! Redemption for bowler. Sombre faces among team fans in the stands and bowler unleashes the Baby-in-the-arms celebration for a change. No celebratory run on this occasion. But poor shot this from batsman. Just runs out of patience and goes hard on the whippy flick, hits it airly and finds Bhajji at short mid-wicket, who takes a sharp catch. bowler gave more flight and it kind of dipped which tempted the team captain into playing that false shot. batsman c Harbhajan b bowler 19(21) [4s-3]"
8140,"SIX, lots of flight on this delivery, batsman clears his frong leg and pumps it straight down the ground for a maximum"
8141,"SIX, that's been hit off the back foot, straight back down the ground for six. Some shot. And that's his fifty too. Krunal must have thought he'd done enough by sliding it across on back of a length to prevent damage. But batsman just leans across and thumps it"
8142,"SIX, that's a googly delivered outside off, not a bad idea. But it's too full, right in the slot, which counters Chahar's thinking. batsman reaches out and clobbers it over long-on"
8143,"1 run, eases this full ball to extra cover, thus bringing up his fifty with a quick single"
8144,"out Caught by Krunal Pandya!! bowler's got batsman, or maybe the Mumbai heat has. This is the exact kind of delivery that was disappearing earlier in the night when the Jamaican got stuck into bowler. But after a brief delay where he was attended by the physio, batsman - even batsman - fails to find the strength to clear deep midwicket. It's right in the slot for him, but he drags it off the inside half to Krunal Pandya. batsman c Krunal Pandya b bowler 63(36) [4s-3 6s-7]"
8145,"FOUR, not where he intended but it's a welcome boundary for Kings XI. Just been a bit of a lull after Gayle's dismissal. Length ball angling away outside off, throws his bat at it and carves it off a thick outside edge between short third and backward point"
8146,"out Caught by de Kock!! Full and wide, batsman has a go, only to get it through off the outside edge. This wasn't in his arc to hit outta the park. Well bowled by bowler who lets out some steam in his celebrations, probably still angry with himself for the previous wide. batsman c de Kock b bowler 7(8) [4s-1]"
8147,"out Caught by Rahul Chahar!! This has been a superb comeback from bowler, and from Mumbai Indians indeed. He was taken for 17 in his first over, but has come back strongly. Low full toss at the stumps, batsman attempts a cross-batted swing - more like a sweep, and skies it up off a thick top-edge. No problems for Chahar at long leg. batsman c Rahul Chahar b bowler 5(6)"
8148,"FOUR, quite a start from batsman who effortlessly lofts bowler on the up over extra cover, with no one back at the boundary there"
8149,"FOUR, two fours out of two. Clears the front leg and scythes this full-wide delivery to the left of sweeper cover"
8150,"out Caught by de Kock!! Yeah, bowler has the final laugh, as he so often does. Slower ball, probably a response to Curran going for a scoop. And scoop he does, straight up and to the keeper with there being no pace to work with. batsman c de Kock b bowler 8(3) [4s-2]"
8151,"FOUR, full ball outside off, not quite in the blockhole, and batsman uses that error in length to slice it through past backward point"
8152,"SIX, good length ball outside off, batsman slaps it over extra cover for six"
8153,"FOUR, over extra cover again. This time it's close to the bottom of his bat, so doesn't have enough power to clear the ropes. But it does have enough power to clear the infield"
8154,"SIX, the result of that deliberation is a short ball at the body. It's brisk from Pandya, but batsman's sharper. He's onto the back foot quicker, swinging the pull over fine leg"
8155,"SIX, and six more. He's tearing into bowler here. 22 off the over already, with two balls left. And Pandya doesn't know how to react. Poor bowling to be honest. Offers length outside off and is slapped back over long-off"
8156,"SIX, here's six of them. He's deep in the crease to bowler, he's cleared his front leg and he's swung this into the stands behind deep midwicket. bowler missing his length there"
8157,"2 runs, he's slipped at the non-striker's end while coming back for two, but he manages to pick himself up for the second run. Take a bow, KL batsman, it's been a pleasure. Slower ball wide of off, jams it towards long-off and then pushes hard on the first run. Mandeep is a willing ally at the danger end, and so batsman gets to the ton he deserves"
8158,"FOUR, kind of a shot batsman would salivate on for days. Wow from batsman! It was on a good length and was wide of off, batsman rocks back and punches it off the backfoot. It beats the cover fielder and races to the fence on this rapid outfield"
8159,"FOUR, short of length delivery outside off, batsman makes room for himself and spears the cut between short third man and backward point. Smashing finish for the Kings XI"
8160,"SIX, that is a high-quality shot. Oh hold on, bat turned in his hand at the point of contact. But the velocity of his bat swing helps him in clearing the fence. It was a pacy delivery on the pads and batsman takes out this closed-faced whip shot and clears the fence"
8161,"SIX, seven balls faced and he has got his eye in now. It was on a fuller length and was on the stumps, batsman clears his front leg and clobbers it over long-on for a maximum"
8162,"SIX, back-to-back sixes for batsman. Are we in for a batsman-storm at the Wankhede! There was hardly any effort behind it. He just waits for the delivery to arrive, it was in his arc around his off-stump and he lifts it over deep mid-wicket for another maximum"
8163,"FOUR, another off-cutter from bowler and this time, batsman was ready for it. He hangs back and smashes it over the in-field on the off-side for a boundary"
8164,"SIX, 23 off the over! Wow! Universe boss is on fire! bowler delivers another slower one, he is not learning from his mistake. It was on the stumps, batsman waits for it and unleashes it straight down the ground for another six"
8165,"FOUR, these two compliment eachother so well. If, Gayle bludgeons the ball, batsman just caresses it. It was a slower one from bowler, batsman picks it up easily, gets in a might fine position and punches it like a boss. It beats cover and races to the fence"
8166,"1 run, runs it down to third man. 50-run partnership comes up! These two are looking ominous for Mumbai"
8167,"SIX, he is looking in his elements today. Form is back, it is certainly back! He identifies the length in a canter(sign of a batsman in form), gets a terrific position and pummels it over deep mid-wicket for another maximum"
8168,"FOUR, another terrific shot, his back leg was flying when he attempted that shot. And white cherry was flying too. Picks up the slower one quickly, delays his bat swing and lifts it over mid-off for another four"
8169,"FOUR, terrific shot! Flighted delivery on the stumps, batsman whips it with a lot of class and authority. It beats deep mid-wicket and canters to the fence. He is in fabulous touch!"
8170,"SIX, that is hugeeeeeeeee! Into the second tier! It was a bumper on the face, batsman stays put and smokes it over deep backward square leg. Good bye ball! Sit back and enjoy that! We are in for a batsman-storm today"
8171,"FOUR, that has been smashed. Wow! What power. It was on a fuller length and was in the arc of batsman, he clears his front leg and pumps it straight down the ground for a boundary. No stopping that!"
8172,"FOUR, bowler needs a hand on his shoulder. And yes, Bumrah is there. He is your mate, Pandya. This is serious hitting from batsman, it was wide of off and batsman carves it wide of long-on for another four"
8173,"1 run, very full and wide of off, batsman went for a reverse, ended up missing it. It might have clipped his edge, it deflects off QDK to the leg-side"
8174,"SIX, ho ho ho! He might have waited 5 years for an IPL debut with team but has taken one ball to make an impact. Short, down leg and has been lifted over fine leg for a sixer. Whatta start for batsman!"
8175,"FOUR, back of a length delivery and has been helped off the hips again. Tucked past deep fine leg for a four. A strike-rate of 500 for batsman"
8176,"FOUR, slapped over extra cover! Just the kind of release shot Kishan was looking for. Wide half volley, he reaches out and chips it comfortably over the infield. No protection in the deep"
8177,"SIX, just over a leaping Miller! If there was one team fielder who could have gotten to this, it was him but not to be. Drag down from bowler and batsman launches it off the back foot down the ground. Raw power and just about manages to get it over long-on. Miller leapt high as much as he could but it kept going over"
8178,"SIX, launched over deep square leg! Short balls might trouble batsman but not this harmless drag down at generous pace. Climbs onto the pull and smashes it into the crowd. Curran better be on his toes because batsman seems to be lining him up"
8179,"FOUR, just past the diving mid-wicket fielder! But this was struck beautifully by batsman. Sat deep to this extra fullish delivery and jabbed it with those strong wrists of it. Flew off the bat and sped to the fence in no time"
8180,"SIX, another flat maximum! batsman has started to find his range and team are clawing their way back into the game through him. In the slot again from Curran and it's been powered down the ground with loads of power. Long-on tried to get across but it was comfortably over the fielder's head"
8181,"out Ishan Kishan Run Out!! Sharp work from Curran! He lets out a roar too. Surely might have been frustrated at the onslaught in the over and although it's not the wicket team wanted, it's definitely potential danger out of the way. Was a good full ball that cramped up batsman on leg stump. He squeezed it to the left of Curran who was quick to get to the ball and fired a direct hit at the bowler's end. Ishan Kishan was always going to be in trouble if the throw hit and that's what happened. Ishan Kishan run out (bowler) 7(10) [4s-1]"
8182,"FOUR, not in control but he's found the gap behind square on the leg-side. Short ball that climbed on Pandya who miscued the pull over backward square leg. Split fine leg and deep square leg with precision"
8183,"FOUR, here we go, Hardik gets off the blocks. Rubbish half tracker from bowler, not much bounce but Hardik crouches low and slaps the pull into the gap at deep mid-wicket fence"
8184,"SIX, muscled away by batsman! Once again, not off the middle but who cares when he can clear the ropes? Makes room and swings through the line over long-on. More off the toe-end but it goes deep into the stands"
8185,"SIX, bang into the comm box! There was a cracking sound and it's back into the ground. batsman has gone bonkers here. In the slot this one and he just extends the chip shot down the ground. Beautifully done and comfortably goes over the fence. Wow!"
8186,"out Caught by Miller!! There's the wicket that team were looking for. Precisely why bowler was brought on, in this over. Not a wicket-taking ball, was actually in the slot but was pacy from bowler and Hardik didn't get hold of it. Never really got going tonight to be honest and the miscue finds a gleeful Miller at long-on. Dolly it is and that's the end of HP. batsman c Miller b bowler 19(13) [4s-2]"
8187,"out Caught by Miller!! Clever from bowler! Second strike in the over and he's doing exactly what he was asked to do. Removes the Pandyas and now, Pollard is stranded with the tail left. This was a slower ball, comfortably slower than his stock pace and Krunal got early into the loft. Ends up chipping it towards extra cover where it's that man, Miller, again. Another sitter for the South African. batsman c Miller b bowler 1(2)"
8188,"FOUR, dropped! Henriques at deep square leg got across to his right and put in a dive, got his hand on it too but didn't stick. And worse, it trickled past him to the fence too. Did take a fine catch earlier and nearly had another really good catch to his name. Joseph was clearly rushed on the bumper and he managed only a top edge on the pull. Gets himself a useful boundary in the end"
8189,"SIX, that's a six to begin with! Can't bowl in the slot to a rampaging batsman, you just can't. Just lifts it down the ground, this is another mishit that clears long-off comfortably. How does he hit these mistimed shots for six? Insane!"
8190,"SIX, freebie and away she goes into the crowd! 50 on captaincy debut in the IPL for batsman. Promoted himself at a crucial part of the run chase and now seems in command. Has to finish it though. Poor ball from Curran who gives a full toss and it's swung over deep square leg Way into the crowd"
8191,"FOUR, hammered wide of mid-off! Joseph showing that he can fetch boundaries too. Not the right length from bowler who put this on a length and Joseph just made room to biff it through the infield. Found the gap perfectly"
8192,"FOUR, that went to the fence like a bullet! Oh, my! Curran missed his length and delivered a slot ball, width on offer as well and batsman won't miss out. Smacks the bones out of this one and it goes on the bounce to the wide long-off fence"
8193,"SIX, dumped over long-off! This is incredible from batsman. We've seen this so many times over the years but still, it looks better every time he repeats it. Another horror ball from Curran, widish length ball and it's dumped with that clean bat swing"
8194,"SIX, that's into the second tier! H-U-G-E! Curran is extremely young and he's paying the price for inexperience. Still doesn't justify the lengths he's bowling. Middle and leg, in the slot once more and batsman bulldozes it over long-on. Mammoth hit. Wow!"
8195,"FOUR, team are almost there! The captain for the night is producing a knock for the ages. Shortish one on leg stump, batsman just swivels across and helps it well wide of short fine leg. Just a hit away now!"
8196,"no ball, SIX, one-handed shovel over deep mid-wicket! The Wankhede is roaring in delight. Whoa! Fantastic scenes at the moment. bowler loses his composure, gives a full toss and he's overstepped too, so many blunders and it's picked over deep mid-wicket. Just another mishit you know, but that's the big man for you"
8197,"out Caught by Miller!! Stunned silence at the Wankhede! batsman falls! Gee, what an anti-climax! The big man thought he had hit another six, the match-winning one but nope, he's found Miller at deep mid-wicket. Was a short ball outside off, had to really fetch it but batsman rode his luck on the pull. Could only sky it high and not long enough. What a turnaround! bowler could still be the hero. Wowza! batsman c Miller b bowler 83(31) [4s-3 6s-10]"
8198,"FOUR, length delivery on the pads and heaved away off the inner half of the bat. The ball dribbled away towards the deep mid fence for a four"
8199,"FOUR, walks down the track, gets hold of the slower length delivery and pierces the gap between cover and extra cover for a four with a drive on the up. Back-to-back fours"
8200,out Bowled!! batsman walks across his sticks and misses the clip to be clean bowled. Quick yorker and batsman was late on it. The leg pole was pegged back. The pressure of 3 dot balls got to batsman and he tried something different. bowler had been bowling the wicket-to-wicket channel and slips in the yorker to out do the batter. Silence prevails at Wankhede. batsman b bowler 15(13) [4s-1 6s-1]
8201,"FOUR, starts the over with a short one and has been dispatched away past point for a four. batsman played it late and got it fine enough"
8202,"no run, what happened there? Miller has spilled this one. Ill-timed jump and he manages to grab a left hand to it and the ball doesn't stick. He leapt up too early and in the end only had to go with a left-hand. batsman gets a life here"
8203,"FOUR, in the slot and disappears over the bowler's head. The cameras pan on Miller, who has a clueless expression on his face. Poor delivery it was and batsman muscled it down the ground"
8204,"FOUR, he does this so often! Uses the pace of the bowler and just dabs it fine to send the ball racing away to deep third man for a four. Was wide, and batsman just got enough wood to send the ball away. 12 runs off the over. bowler has gone for 37 already"
8205,"FOUR, pulled or tucked? Decide for yourself. Was very wristy though as he got hold of the short ball and just gave it direction to get it past short fine leg. That scorched away"
8206,"1 run, dropped down the leg-side. Second drop of the innings. This might turn out to be costly for team. Short ball, down leg, batsman goes for the pull and gets a glove. The ball flies fine and Rahul got both hands to it diving to his right but spilled it. The two batters steal a single as well. And to make matters worse, a bout of cramps seem to have engulfed Rahul. He seems to be in some agonising pain"
8207,out Caught by (sub)Henriques!! Flicked off the pads and taken superbly by the man at deep backward square. That was on the pads and batsman nonchalantly clipped it away without even thinking of keeping it down. The ball kept flying away before being plucked out by the substitute fielder. batsman c (sub)Henriques b bowler 21(15) [4s-4]
8208,"out Caught by Miller!! Charges out, slams it down the ground and Miller makes amends for the drop by taking a good catch here. Miller covered some good ground to his left, then put in the slide with his knees dug into the ground and plucked it out of thin air. team making this game their own with a couple of good catches here. batsman c Miller b bowler 24(23) [4s-2]"
8209,"out Bowled!! That is a peach, an absolute peach. Give Kulkarni the new cherry and more often than not he will deliver. It was on a good length and it shapes away from batsman a bit, he wanted to whip it across the line, ends up playing it down the wrong line. It breaches his defence and clatters the stumps. The horrible season for batsman continues. batsman b bowler 0(4)"
8210,"FOUR, batsman is away and how! He is fearless and he flaunted that there. It was on a length and was wide of off, batsman backs away, makes room and thumps it wide of cover for a boundary"
8211,"out batsman Run Out!! Stephen Fleming shakes his head in the dug-out. And this is probably the first time he is showing discontentment in this IPL season. It was on a length and batsman tucks it straight to Archer at short fine, Faf charges for a single and batsman for some reason instead of running was ball-watching ( A criminal thing to do). Archer picks it up cleanly and smashes the stumps at the non striker's end where batsman was short of the crease. team are off to a perfect start. batsman run out (Jofra Archer) 4(4) [4s-1]"
8212,"SIX, batsman powers this slog-sweep to the left of deep midwicket, sending it crashing into the ad cushions. That's hit them on the full. batsman has come out firing from the onset in contrast to his usual formula"
8213,"FOUR, nails this overpitched delivery straight back down the ground. This is excellent batting. They've not allowed Rahane to get through a few cheap overs of spin which he would've so dearly loved"
8214,"no run, huge shout of ""no"" from batsman, but that came only after he took a couple of steps down which set Rayudu on the charge. Rayudu had made it almost halfway down before having to turn back. Back of a length just outside off, patted to backward point. Rayudu changed direction while running and had the throw hit him, or even with a direct-hit, he was gone"
8215,"SIX, fetches this leg-break from well outside off and muscles it over long-on. Gopal turns back as if to say he didn't do much wrong there, and he maybe right. But batsman looks on tonight"
8216,"SIX, advances to a slower ball and slaps it over mid-off, and over the boundary too. He had stepped towards the leg-side, and found himself reaching for the ball that was outside off. But that didn't seem to hamper the timing"
8217,"SIX, batsman is getting there. He's getting back to being the player he is. Steps out and swats this length ball over long-on"
8218,"FOUR, sits back deep in the crease to a slower ball, getting in a great position to dispatch it through midwicket. That brings up his fifty, just the boost in confidence he needed"
8219,"FOUR, short of length at the body, carrying none of the venom that Archer's bouncer did. So batsman just leans back and helps the pull away comfortably wide of fine leg"
8220,"out Caught by Shreyas Gopal!! That's turned out to be a superb catch from Shreyas Gopal. He may have misjudged it initially, came running in, but then has to cut back to the right, almost going zig-zag. Eventually takes it behind his body. It's the slower ball from bowler that brings out the miscue from batsman, and these long square boundaries ensure that it doesn't go over. batsman c Shreyas Gopal b bowler 57(47) [4s-2 6s-3]"
8221,"2 runs, slower leg-cutter just outside off, batsman steers it through point and charges back for two"
8222,"FOUR, and the inside edge for four. That's just kept team in it. Full ball angled in on leg, it was in the slot and batsman swings hard, only to send it racing off the inside edge"
8223,"SIX, this is an unbelievable shot from Ravindra batsman, even going past the one that Russell hit against team. Russell was only about to fall down while reaching for a wide one outside off, but batsman has proper fallen down but has still managed to club it down the ground for six. This is ridiculous"
8224,"out Bowled!! He probably won't bowl a better yorker than this one. That's just perfect from Ben bowler as he cannons it on middle and has batsman playing over it. Smashes into the base of middle stump. Phew, what drama! batsman b bowler 58(43) [4s-2 6s-3]"
8225,"SIX, he's hit this miles! slower ball around off, right in the slot for batsman who smokes it down the ground. This has cleared the boundary, and then some, as he clinches it for team. What an insane, insane finish to wrap up the drama of a final over which will be talked about for a while"
8226,"out Caught by R Tripathi!! Oh dear! Oh dear! What is happening! team have turned ON the HARAKIRI mode! This is rare, very rare. And look at bowler, he is pumped. It was a short of length delivery around hip-height, batsman pulled and he gave the impression that he got decent amount of willow behind it. But square boundaries at SMS are massive and Faf picked up the man in the deep to perfection. Tripathi dives forward and takes a terrific catch. Fielding has been top-notch from the Royals! batsman c R Tripathi b bowler 7(10)"
8227,"SIX, this is typical batsman, he charges down the ground to gather momentum, transforms the good length delivery into a fuller one. And lofts it straight down the ground, the timing was pretty good and it sails over the fence for a maximum"
8228,"no run, Steve Smith thinks batsman has got an outside edge to it. And Rahane has showed trust in the Australian, he has gone for a review. batsman has missed it by a country mile. And I have no clue what Smith heard there. It proved to be a horrible decision as there was a huge gap between the bat and the pad. It was a good length delivery wide of off and it beats the outside edge of batsman"
8229,"out Caught by Stokes!! Wow! What a moment in the match. Stokes you beauty! David de Gea would have been proud of that effort. It was a short of length delivery wide of off, batsman cuts and cuts hard. It was in the air, Stokes flies in the air, times the jump to perfection and pulls off a stunning catch. Catch for the ages! He charges towards third man and punches the air in delight. Such moments can change the match, such moments can turn around the tournament for your team. team are in huge huge trouble now. batsman c Stokes b bowler 1(6)"
8230,"SIX, this is an air-strike from MS. Even IAF would have been proud of it. He dashes down the ground in a canter, gets to the pitch of the ball and clobbers it into the night-sky. It sails into the crowd!"
8231,"FOUR, batsman gets off the mark in style! A 132.7kph length ball, batsman walks forward and across, closes his bat-face and clips it through the mid-wicket region. The fielder on the on-side got a hand to it, but the outfield is swift here"
8232,"SIX, incredible shot! Wasn't a bad ball by any means. A short of length delivery from bowler, batsman stayed in his crease and went downtown. Thumps it over the bowler's head for half a dozen. It was on the stumps and batsman generated all the power from the crease"
8233,"FOUR, good shot! The team skipper shimmies down the track, gets close to the pitch of this quicker ball and chips it over wide mid-on"
8234,"FOUR, once again batsman advances down the track, bowler saw that and shortened his length. It was slower as well. But, batsman is well equipped. Despite not getting to the pitch of the ball, he holds his shape and lifts it over extra cover"
8235,"out Caught by Rayudu!! It's not happening on the night for the Royals. An ugly looking slog for batsman and he becomes RJ's 100th IPL wicket. A nothing shot from one of the premier batsman across every format - this was tossed up around middle, batsman bent down on the slog sweep, didn't get close to the ball and only managed to shovel it into the safe hands of Rayudu at deep mid-wicket. A disappointing shot and the Royals have lost half their side. batsman c Rayudu b bowler 15(22) [4s-1]"
8236,"no run, was there an edge on that? Yes, but it was too fast - even for someone like MSD - pushed through flatter and quicker of off, stayed a tad low as well - batsman was back on the punch, gets a toe-end that rolls off MSD's pads"
8237,"FOUR, lovely shot, a juicy full-toss from bowler, Parag comes down the track and clears mid-wicket with the lofted on-drive"
8238,"FOUR, that was a half-chance, but bowler was way too late to react - dropped short and at the stumps - Parag backed away on the punch, was done in by the wrong 'un and looped it back at the bowler - huit it hard enough to bisect both men in the deep"
8239,"out Caught by Dhoni!! Edged and caught! Shardul can buy a lottery ticket today - this was a cross-seam delivery that was short and wide of off, Parag's eyes lit up as he saw the width, went hard on the cut and only managed a thick audible edge. Straight through to MS and young Parag walks. Six down and the Royals are struggling to set a competitive score. batsman c Dhoni b bowler 16(14) [4s-2]"
8240,"FOUR, lovely, tossed up just outside off, batsman is quick to bend down, rolls his wrists and then plays the reverse sweep - past short third man and runs away to the ropes"
8241,"2 runs, a run-out chance and Thakur has missed it - couldn't collect the ball - had he done so, Jofra Archer was a long way short - was called for the second run and he wasn't ready for it. Gave up the ghost - but so did the bowler, who didn't gather an awkward throw - it was worked square past point and batsman always wanted two"
8242,"out Bowled!! A big heave and batsman has missed it completely - the leg-stump is on the ground and bowler continues to be impressive. The knuckle ball, pitched on off and kept coming back with the angle, batsman backed away on a mighty heave and missed - stumps in a mess and so are the Royals' hopes of getting to 150. batsman b bowler 28(26) [4s-1]"
8243,"FOUR, lovely, the slower ball and Shreyas picked it, backed away and lifts it over mid-off, almost went all the way, bounced just in front of the ropes for a boundary"
8244,"FOUR, cracking shot, Shreyas is playing a handy cameo here, length ball and he drilled it back over the bowler's head - mid-off was inside the ring and the man at long-on couldn't get across in time"
8245,"SIX, lovely, Shreyas is making the team captain think - length ball outside off and he lifted it nonchalantly over the head of the fielder at mid-off - the timing is sweet and the ball sailed over the ropes for a maximum"
8246,"FOUR, cracking shot, this is a poor over from Thakur, banged in short and at the stumps, Archer swivels across and helps it over short fine, one bounce and over the ropes"
8247,"FOUR, shot! A short of a good length ball at 133.4kph, batsman stays back in his crease and punches it superbly through the gap between cover and cover-point. Once he found the gap, the outfield did the rest"
8248,out Lbw!! MS has a chat with the bowler and decides to review .. in the nick of time. batsman shuffled across and missed the flick. A fair delivery. Clearly no bat. The impact is on middle and ball-tracking shows it to be hitting leg! Bruce Oxenford has overturned his original decision. The bowler had a lengthy chat with skipper and a jovial-looking MS Dhoni signalled 'T' only at the last second. Turned out to be the correct move. A fuller-than-a-good-length ball and batsman had walked across a long way to work it square on the leg-side. Three reds on HawkEye! batsman lbw b bowler 14(11) [4s-3]
8249,"FOUR, terrific shot to get off the mark! bowler shortens his length, no real pace to threaten the batsman. batsman stands tall and pulls it backward of square leg. The man in the deep dives, but in vain"
8250,"FOUR, batsman welcomes Thakur with a boundary. Another venom-less shortish ball, batsman pulls it hard behind square on the on-side"
8251,"FOUR, shot! Thakur bowls length at 140kph, batsman stays in his crease, slightly clears his front leg and batters it between mid-off and extra cover"
8252,"FOUR, hat-trick of fours! Too straight on this occasion and batsman tickles it to fine leg for another boundary"
8253,"out Caught by Rayudu!! Shardul Thakur has the last laugh. MS applauds. A horror shot from batsman, though. After hitting three successive boundaries, batsman tries to play another biggie. He hung back and wanted to thump it downtown - this short of length delivery - similar to the shot he played off Chahar. But, this time, Jos lost his shape in the process and the ball ballooned up a long way off the top part of the bat. Rayudu settles under it at the extra cover region and snaffles with both hands. The danger man has thrown his wicket away here. batsman c Rayudu b bowler 23(10) [4s-4 6s-1]"
8254,"FOUR, makes contact on this occasion and the ball reaches the fence in a jiffy. Similar length - back of a length - normal-paced though. batsman picked the length early and pulled it through the gap between mid-on and mid-wicket"
8255,"out Caught by (sub)Shorey!! One, two, three and taken in the end. The substitute fielder takes a juggling catch. Rajasthan lose their third wicket. Hint of away-spin, and batsman doesn't get the timing right on his one-legged sweep. It was on the leg-stump line and hence batsman went for that shot. Shorey ran in from deep square leg and almost made a mess of it. It brushed the cap and made contact with his right arm too. In the end, he pouched that. batsman c (sub)Shorey b bowler 6(6) [4s-1]"
8256,"no run, turns away tantalizingly beating to the outside edge. Replays show that there was an outside edge and MS dropped it"
8257,"FOUR, shot! bowler bowls it slightly fuller and Tripathi plays the inside-out shot superbly. Faf runs across and slides to his left, but allows it to go past the ropes"
8258,"out Caught by Kedar Jadhav!! Kedar takes a smart catch and Rajasthan lose their fourth wicket. Tripathi tries to play another inside-out drive against this 94.6kph fullish ball. The ball spins away and flies off the outside edge. Kedar Jadhav at backward point, jumps and goes for a one-handed catch. Doesn't succeed in the first attempt, holds his nerves and gobbles it with both the hands in the end. batsman c Kedar Jadhav b bowler 10(12) [4s-1]"
8259,"SIX, an absolute treat to watch him bat. Especially when he gets his timing right. Goes down on his knee early and carves the length delivery over deep point, that's a flat six for Shaw"
8260,"SIX, one-handed slap! Wow! Over long-off for a sixer. Tossed up ball and batsman danced out to canon the ball over the deep long-off fielder's head for a big six. The ball has been kissed by the curse of oblivion as well"
8261,"FOUR, the partnership between batsman and Pant is now 50. Sublime! Pitched up delivery outside off and batsman cracks the drive past cover for a four. The ball sped away past cover in a flash. Stand and deliver from Gabbar"
8262,"FOUR, pitched up delivery and that has been spanked on the up. The ball rockets off the bat and past the dive of the man at cover for another four"
8263,"FOUR, thrashed! That was a poor delivery and has been spanked off the back foot. Picked the googly and smashed it past cover for a four"
8264,"FOUR, takes it from well outside off and sweeps it away squarer. That was off the inner half of the blade and made enough contact to speed away into the gap on the on-side. 49 needed. The game getting easier for team"
8265,"FOUR, the sound of the bat when it met leather! Wow. Pitched up delivery and smoked past mid-off. Russell put in a pool-like dive but in vain. The pitched up deliveries aren't working"
8266,"FOUR, chips down the track, converts it into a pitched up delivery and smokes it down the ground for a four. He has been finding gaps at ease tonight. That was the googly from bowler"
8267,"FOUR, blasted! Full again. The length on the fuller side has disappeared. That was rocketed past cover for a four. 26 off 22"
8268,"SIX, the partnership between batsman and Dhawan is now 100. Kneels down on one knee and smacks it over long-on for a sixer. Slower delivery and batsman picked the bones out of that dead meat of a delivery"
8269,"out Caught by Kuldeep Yadav!! And the move works. batsman has again thrown it away and failed to finish. Not what team wanted. Not what Ponting wanted either and not what he himself wanted ahead of the WC selection. All these little things matter. Fantastic knock but he has thrown it away at the brink of it. 17 still needed. Was loopy ball, batsman charged out, threw his weight behind the shot with one hand off and the ball landed straight into the hands of the man at long-on. batsman c Kuldeep Yadav b bowler 46(31) [4s-4 6s-2]"
8270,"FOUR, handy runs! Looks to smash it away and the ball runs away off the outer edge for a four. 7 more needed now. He wanted to smack it out of the park but ended up edging it"
8271,"SIX, and another team batsman has been denied a century here. This time by his partner but the team wins. Was a floaty delivery and was heaved over long-on for a sixer. team were favorites and have been humbled here by a professional team team, who move to number 4 in the points table"
8272,"SIX, two sixes in the over, just the kind of momentum Delhi were looking for. Shaw was expecting a short ball and bowler gives him what he desired for. The ball skids on, Shaw takes his eyes off the ball and swivels. Gets a fat top-edge that flies over the keeper's head. 14 runs in the over!"
8273,"SIX, Delhi openers dealing in sixes! Another short ball outside off, batsman slashes hard at it and gets an outside edge. This one flies over the cordon and that's six more for the Capitals"
8274,"FOUR, both batsmen have a good time out in the middle. They're making the most out of these powerplay overs. batsman puts down on his dancing shoes and slices the short ball over cover-point. No fielder in the deep and that's a boundary"
8275,"no run, team review! Has batsman nicked it? Or did it come off the jersey? There was a certain sound but don't think it came off the willow. Or is it the trouser? Waiting for the replays. There's a spike on UltraEdge but not sure whether it's the inside edge or off the trousers. A tough call for the third umpire. No conclusive evidence and the onfield decision stays. team have lost their only review. A short delivery that was angled into the batsman, batsman was looking to block it as the ball brushed his trouser and settled into the keeper's gloves"
8276,"SIX, team bowlers have been too short so far! bowler bowls another short ball outside off, batsman hops a touch and slices it over deep backward point for six more. It's raining sixes at the Eden Gardens, Delhi Capitals off to a flier"
8277,"out Caught by Karthik!! Terrific catch by a flying DK! Excellent delivery too. Short of a length around off and jags away a tad. Shaw tries to defend it off his back foot, gets squared up somewhat and gets a thick outside edge. The team skipper flies to his right and plucks it out of thin air. Not for the first time have we seen him take such a blinder. Quite an eventful over that. 17 runs and a wicket to cap it off. batsman c Karthik b bowler 14(7) [6s-2]"
8278,"FOUR, that's an awful misfield by Krishna! Russell ain't a happy man. Was a short delivery that was chopped to short third man where Krishna lets it through him and gifts four to the batting team"
8279,"FOUR, edged but safe! On a length outside off, slanted away from the batsman, batsman pokes at it and gets a regulation outside edge. Rana was stationed at wide slip throws himself to his right but fails to cling on to the catch"
8280,"FOUR, gorgeous shot by Shikhar! Gets an overpitched delivery and the southpaw makes sure to make the most out of it. Drills it straight past the fielder at mid-on who was a touch square, four more for batsman"
8281,"FOUR, 50 up for Delhi and it has come at the rate of knots. bowler serves another overcooked delivery and the Delhi skipper plays an exquisite on-drive. Mid-on is no where close to cut this down, beautiful shot!"
8282,"FOUR, dispatched with disdain! Short in length around off, batsman stands tall and hacks across the line. Times this one to perfection and sends it to the deep mid-wicket fence. Proper knock-out punch this is proving to be. Things are only going to get worse from here on, especially with the dew setting in"
8283,"out Caught by Karthik!! Is there anything that Dre Russ can't do on the cricket field? Wasn't that great a delivery but Kolkata will take it. A short ball down the leg side, Iyer tries to play a leg glance but gets a feather as the ball swings away. A much easier catch for DK this time around and Iyer doesn't wait for the umpire's call. Starts walking straight away. Probably the reason why they're ranked first in the Fairplay points table. batsman c Karthik b bowler 6(6) [4s-1]"
8284,"FOUR, slogged away! batsman gets his first boundary of the night. Goes down on his knee and places the slog to perfection. Finds the pocket at cow-corner and that shall spoil bowler's opening over. Had conceded only six till then, but the boundary takes it into double digits"
8285,"2 runs, short in length around middle and leg, batsman shimmies down the wicket and tucks it through the leg side. Hadn't got the timing right and that allowed him to easily come back for two"
8286,"FOUR, 34th fifty for batsman! Gets there in style in. Slower ball outside off, batsman reaches for it and smashes it through the gap at covers. Gets to the milestone and announces his return to form"
8287,"FOUR, gift of a delivery for the batsman. Short in length on leg and batsman pulls it with nonchalance. Beats the fielder at deep backward square leg and adds four more to his tally"
8288,"out Bowled!! A first-ball duck on IPL debut for batsman - a perfect start to the game for bowler, this was pitched up and nipped back in sharply - batsman hasn't had an idea about the conditions, went with hard hands on the drive - the ball burst past the inside edge and rattled the off-stump. It goes for a walk and the celebrations start in the team camp. batsman b bowler 0(1)"
8289,"FOUR, beautifully played, a gentle loosener from Morris, half-volley on Shubman's pads, he gets inside the line, brings his wrists into play and flicks it past square leg"
8290,"FOUR, lovely, too straight from Morris, he hasn't hit his stride as yet - batsman gets inside the line and clips it neatly through mid-wicket, no need to run for those"
8291,"SIX, superb shot! Much-needed for team. Probably the first one that bowler floated ever so slightly and Gill was down the pitch in a flash. Lofted through the line and send it soaring down the ground. Clears the ropes with ease"
8292,"1 run, 2nd IPL fifty for Gill! First innings as an opener and he's grabbed the opportunity. This kid is class apart and it's only a matter of time before he proves that. Good knock so far and will want to bat deep. Reaches the landmark with a slice down to third man"
8293,"SIX, just clears Dhawan! For a moment, he was certainly excited but it just about cleared him. The miscued pick up shot from Rana and he got plenty of height on it. As it panned out, the distance too by a whisker"
8294,"out Bowled!! Yorks him! Brilliant riposte from Morris. Nails the yorker with perfection and Rana who was backing away to make room, had to get his bat down in time. Couldn't due to the pace and precision of the delivery. Timber. team are keeping a squeeze on this game with some superb planning in the bowling department. batsman b bowler 11(12) [6s-1]"
8295,"FOUR, Russell is away. Gets width on offer and he just backs away to hack this through point. Well wide of sweeper who had no chance"
8296,"SIX, smoked over wide long-on! Gill has to up the ante now, being the set batsman and seems like he has made up his mind. In the slot, slightly oustide off and he fetches it with a clean bat swing. Slog swept merrily over the ropes"
8297,"FOUR, deft touch and more runs. bowler fires it well down leg and Gill responds with a calm paddle sweep. Gets it past the diving short fine leg fielder and this outfield shows no mercy"
8298,"FOUR, batting of the highest class! There is a backward point and short third man in place, it's a slower ball and what does Gill do? Calmly open the face of the blade to split the two with pinpoint precision. The lad is putting on a show here"
8299,"out Caught by Axar!! What an anti-climax for Gill! For someone who batted with so much authority, he's got out to a poor delivery, a scoring delivery. Was fed down the leg-side and he went for an aerial flick. Just had to beat short fine leg to get another boundary but picks out Axar stationed in the ring. Soft dismissal and Gill knows it. Superb innings nevertheless from the young man. batsman c Axar b bowler 65(39) [4s-7 6s-2]"
8300,"FOUR, wrong line from Paul who gets this shortish length ball on the hips, Russell just gets a tickle down to the fine leg fence"
8301,"out Caught by Dhawan!! Another soft dismissal. bowler has his second and team are pressing the advantage home here. Pacy full ball on the pads and batsman goes that favorite aerial flick of his. Only that this time, there is a deep square leg in place for such kind of an adventure. Dhawan gobbles it up and gives his signature thigh slap. bowler was brought to break this potentially threatening pair and he does precisely that, although Russell is still there. batsman c Dhawan b bowler 2(3)"
8302,"FOUR, clever from Russell. Was winding up for the big hit but sensed the slower ball, adjusted and opened the bat face ever so late. Split the diving backward point fielder and it was wide of short third man too"
8303,"SIX, length ball, boom! Slower ball from bowler but misses his length, right down Russell's street and he clears his front leg to dump this over wide long-on. First maximum for the big man"
8304,"SIX, high full toss and Russell clobbers this over deep square leg. Meaty hit and it's goes deep into the crowd. Not given a no ball and Russell is livid! Maybe DK should walk out into the field? No such drama this time but to be honest, this is another of the countless umpiring howlers we've had this IPL"
8305,"SIX, top-edge but it's six! And he's not even looking at the ball while connecting here, yet gets a maximum. How Dre Russ? How? Was rushed by the pacy bumper which was well-directed, wanted to duck but couldn't and the fat top edge sails over fine leg. Whoa!"
8306,"SIX, he's got a big piece of this one alright! Short ball again, right approach but Russell backs away and blasts the pull over deep square leg. Again not off the middle of the bat but these trivial things don't matter for Russell"
8307,out Caught by Rabada!! Massive wicket! Good planning from team for this wicket. Morris went round the wicket and wanted to execute the wide yorker from that angle. Didn't get it fully right and was a low full toss but induced the slice from Russell who didn't get the desired connection. It's flat and towards deep backward point where Rabada accepts it with glee. This wicket will definitely make a difference of 15-20 runs to the eventual total and team know it. batsman c Rabada b bowler 45(21) [4s-3 6s-4]
8308,"FOUR, fortune for batsman but he won't mind as long as the runs keep coming. Wanted to heave this away but got deceived by the slower ball and got an inside edge onto the pad. Trickled past leg stump and went very fine down the leg-side to the fence. Handy for team"
8309,"3 runs, in the air...falls safe! Rabada and Tewatia were after the chance, was ideally the South African's catch but his mate tries with a dive, only to get nowhere near the ball. batsman had got the timing wrong once again on the loft but survives. Excellent running gives team three more"
8310,"out Caught by Rahul Tewatia!! batsman's innings ends. Rightly played second fiddle to Russell earlier although he could have tried at least one big shot. Now, in an attempt to up the ante, doesn't get the placement right on the slog. Timing wasn't great either and holes out to deep mid-wicket. batsman c Rahul Tewatia b bowler 6(7)"
8311,"FOUR, squeezed away by batsman! He's providing the hosts with some useful runs. Terrific yorker from Paul and it's stabbed with an open bat face. Gets it wide of short third man somehow and away she goes to the fence"
8312,"1 run, a direct hit might have been interesting - Shubman pushed this one in front of mid-on and called for a quick single - it was always a dicey single - Shreyas was quick on the ball and has a shy - had he hit, Shubman would have been short, despite the dive"
8313,"FOUR, cracking shot, fraction too short from bowler, Shubman stands tall and pulls it in front of square on the on-side - beat mid-wicket and raced away across the fast outfield"
8314,"FOUR, that's a typical batsman shot - made room to a good length delivery and then sliced the drive over backward point - didn't get hold of the shot, but has enough to clear the fielders inside the ring"
8315,"FOUR, lovely, floaty half-volley on the pads and batsman needs no second invitation, gets inside the line and flicks it behind square on the on-side - almost went all the way, bounced just in front of the ropes"
8316,"FOUR, nice touch from batsman, back of a length and just outside off, batsman waits on it, opens the face of the bat at the last moment and runs it fine, good enough to beat third man"
8317,"FOUR, lovely, tad too short from bowler, Shubman waits on it and then flat-bats it wide of mid-on, no need to run for those"
8318,"FOUR, beautifully done - he's got a promotion and he's showing his class, leg-stump half-volley from bowler, Shubman gets inside the line and flicks it over square leg, one bounce and over the ropes"
8319,"SIX, batsman breaks the shackles, back of a length and well outside off, sat up to be smacked and batsman pulled it high and over long-on for a maximum"
8320,"FOUR, lovely, back of a length and well wide of off, Shubman stands tall and caresses the punch behind point - the timing is sublime and the fielder at third man has no chance"
8321,"out Caught by Pant!! That's a top catch from Pant and bowler has got his man - followed the slower yorker with a fiery bouncer - short and angling down the leg-side, batsman was looking to help it on its way - all that he managed was a glove. The ball was travelling, but Pant tumbled to his left, leapt high and completed a fine catch. batsman c Pant b bowler 28(30) [4s-4 6s-1]"
8322,"out Caught by Buttler!! bowler finds the breakthrough. A length ball at 146.3kph, batsman tries to smash across the line by fetching it from outside off. Loses his timing - courtesy the extra pace - and spoons a straightforward catch to Buttler at long-on. batsman isn't happy with himself. He knows that he has gifted his wicket away here on a belter. batsman c Buttler b bowler 47(32) [4s-6 6s-1]"
8323,"1 run, eighth IPL fifty for batsman - second this season. bowler pulls his length back, batsman has ample time to muscle the pull to deep mid-wicket. Just a raise of the bat from the southpaw"
8324,"SIX, batsman goes downtown and he's made good contact. Gopal slightly overpitches and the right-hander takes heavy toll of it. Stays leg-side of the ball, stands tall and bludgeons it over long-off for a maximum"
8325,"out Bowled!! Bowled 'em! 'You miss, I hit' stuff. It was a cutter from Dhawal Kulkarni, not sure if batsman picked that. He backed away to crash it through the off-side. But the ball sneaked under his blade to dislodge the off-bail. batsman b bowler 16(10) [6s-1]"
8326,"FOUR, spanked! Slow, short and wide - asking to be punished. batsman makes room as he walks down and slaps it through extra cover. Raced away to the fence"
8327,"FOUR, 114.1kph, slower full ball around off, batsman gets down to swipe across the line, gets a fat top-edge and the ball runs away fine for a one-bounce four into the third man fence"
8328,"leg byes, 1 run, good yorker, follows batsman who was backing away. Off the right boot towards short fine leg. Direct hit would have gotten Pollard who was lazy as he ambled in"
8329,"out Caught by Shreyas Gopal!! Archer wins the battle straightaway! Massive strike, considering batsman's recent hitting form. He never got going today though, seemed scratchy and even disinterested a bit. Had to launch now with enough batting in the shed and opts for the muscular slog of his. The length isn't there and the result is a miscue that goes miles in the air. Brilliant catch from Gopal who steadied himself nicely at mid-wicket to take it with a tumble. Never easy these catches, especially if they are of a dangerous batsman, the pressure just adds up. batsman c Shreyas Gopal b bowler 6(12)"
8330,"FOUR, streaky runs but team won't mind it at this stage of the innings. Full toss and should have actually been dispatched for a six but batsman doesn't middle it well enough. Gets a fat inside edge that's well wide of short fine leg and speeds away"
8331,"SIX, this is a Hardik special! Picked the slower ball early and shuffled across to slug this over deep mid-wicket. Clean bat swing and struck it ever so cleanly"
8332,"FOUR, clears a flying extra cover fielder! Good hit from the increasingly tired batsman. Made room and read the slower ball well before slapping it over the infield. Smashed it really well"
8333,"out Caught by Buttler!! Stunner of a catch from Buttler! Wow! Had to cover a lot of ground from long-off, did so and timed the dive to perfection as well. Mind you, he didn't have the reaction time to do it with ease and so had to really rush. But that's the hallmark of a superb fielder, made it look like regulation stuff. Ends a fine knock from batsman who was visibly jaded. Went for the loft but was undone by the slower ball this time. Sliced it down the ground and on some days, might have survived but not today. Not with Buttler manning that area. batsman c Buttler b bowler 81(52) [4s-6 6s-4]"
8334,"SIX, lovely mini-helicopter from Hardik! It's a shot that he's developed in recent times and not only is it great to watch but also is extremely effective. Archer didn't really miss his yorker by much here, was quite full in length but HP is sitting very deep, waiting for any slipup in length. Then just propels it with that flourish of his to send it deep into the stands"
8335,"FOUR, Kishan joins the party now. Length ball from bowler, horror stuff at this stage of the innings and it's heaved away over the gap at mid-wicket. Struck really hard"
8336,out Caught by Buttler!! Buttler is having a field day with his catching. This is a dolly though. Was a low full toss and Kishan couldn't quite get the desired distance on the loft. Skewed it more off the toe-end and it went flat to long-off where Buttler made no mistake. Hardik Pandya has got back on strike though as the batsmen crossed and that's a positive for team. batsman c Buttler b bowler 5(3) [4s-1]
8337,"FOUR, two was the call from Hardik as he hit this but he's got enough power to get this all the way to the fence. Slower short ball, he tried to muscle it with all his might and forced this through the gap at mid-wicket. Bisected the big gap on the leg-side and though the mid-wicket fielder tried to get across, he couldn't"
8338,"SIX, smoked away! Slower ball but it's in the slot and Hardik has picked it as well. Sits deep to clobber this over long-on. For a moment, Buttler thought he had another catch but in the end, it's well over his head. Brilliant cameo from Hardik"
8339,"SIX, massive, tossed up on off, batsman gets close to the ball and lifts it with the angle, sent it high and deep into the stands at long-on"
8340,"FOUR, nicely played, flighted on the leg-stump line, batsman bends down low and then helps it over square leg with a half-lined sweep, couple of bounces and over the ropes"
8341,"FOUR, this is excellent batting from batsman, tad too full from bowler, can't do so with mid-on inside the ring - batsman gets a good stride forward and lifts it over that man, almost went all the way, one bounce and over the ropes - 18 from the over"
8342,"FOUR, cracking shot, width on offer from Dhawal, batsman leans into the drive, played with a closed face and found the gap wide of cover-point for a boundary"
8343,"FOUR, this is all too easy for batsman, length ball outside off, he backed away, opened up the off-side and cleared cover with the lofted drive, one bounce and over the ropes"
8344,"FOUR, cracking shot, too much width from Dhawal, can't do so against the quality of batsman - he leans into the drive, plays with an open face and drives it square past cover-point for another boundary"
8345,"FOUR, edged and four, wry smile on Archer's face, shortened his length and got it to hold its line, batsman was looking to work it to the on-side, closed the bat-face, got a thick leading edge that raced away through the vacant slip cordon"
8346,"SIX, massive, batsman is in the mood today, short of a length and at the stumps, batsman swivelled across on the pull and sent it miles in the air - high and over deep mid-wicket for a maximum"
8347,"SIX, the attempted off-break from bowler, turns out to be a juicy full-toss, batsman leans forward and deposits it high and over long-on for a maximum"
8348,"SIX, lovely, too full from bowler, batsman gets under it and clobbers it high and over wide long-on for a mamximum"
8349,"SIX, a biggie! Krishnappa bowler fires a ball right in batsman's slot. The skipper, with a big back-lift, swings his bat hard to deposit it over cow corner"
8350,"FOUR, bowler bowls it slightly wide of off, but batsman is well equipped to put that away. Bends his back leg, gets underneath the ball and tonks it over the bowler's head"
8351,"FOUR, a dart at 99.8kph wide of off, batsman throws his bat at it and slashes it through backward point. 15 off the over with two balls to go"
8352,"FOUR, dropped by Rohit! Sharp chance but he didn't time the leap well, ended up getting a hand and it dribbled away down to the long-off fence. Was in the slot as batsman went for the loft down the ground. Didn't get it off the middle and if not for Rohit's lapse in fielding, the team skipper might have been on his way"
8353,"no run, good review in the end from batsman! Fell across a bit on the flick and missed the indipper to get pinged on the front pad. The umpire didn't waste any time in raising his finger for the LBW but batsman wanted to review it. Height was the only thing that could have bailed him out and even that didn't look likely in real time. However, the nature of the Wankhede surface aids Jinks in the end as HawkEye shows it to be going over the sticks"
8354,"FOUR, lifted over the infield! One of batsman's go-to shots in the powerplay. Stands tall this time to the good length ball and carves it over cover. More off the cue-end really but he's got enuugh power to clear the field and it trickles away"
8355,"1 run, fifty for batsman. He holds the key to this run chase for both sides. The longer he stays the better for Rajasthan, but not for Mumbai. Fuller and outside off, batsman is happy to push it down to long-off and take the single"
8356,"SIX, this was coming with Bumrah's quiet over. batsman shimmies down the wicket, gets close to the flighted delivery and smokes it into the second tier near cow corner"
8357,"1 run, delivers this by coming in between the umpire, batsman nudges it to mid-wicket"
8358,"SIX, they have made up for Bumrah's over. batsman comes down the track, takes it on the full and the rest was easy, he uses a clean bat swing to clear long-off"
8359,"SIX, steps leg-side, gets a full toss and biffs it straight back down the ground. Another six, his sixth of the evening"
8360,"FOUR, they're taking the game away in a rush. Pitched up outside off, batsman stands where he is, no movement of the feet and crashes it through extra cover"
8361,"FOUR, no stopping him here. Joseph's given a full toss, he's pitched one full and wide, and now he's gone for a back of a length slower ball outside off. batsman picks it up, waits on it and cuts it through backward point"
8362,"FOUR, and even a yorker isn't spared. Reaches out for this outside off and squeezes it past the keeper. Third man was in the ring anyway"
8363,"FOUR, steers another yorker to the third man boundary. Mumbai looking absolutely clueless. Rohit claps for his bowler who's hardly faltered with his execution, but that's hardly much consolation for bowler"
8364,"SIX, in the slot for batsman who swipes it into the stands over wide long-on. 28 off the over. He's killed this game off just like that"
8365,"1 run, that sums up the kind of day Mumbai are having. Sliced up in the air off the outside half, falls right between extra cover and sweeper cover. Rohit may have fallen on his face while diving back. He looks to be all right"
8366,"out Caught by Suryakumar Yadav!! He's skied this up off the outside half and is caught down at long-off. No hundred for Jos batsman, who wasn't playing for it either. Saw the flight and went for it. This is very well bowled from Chahar as he slowed it up and teased him with a leg-break well outside off. batsman c Suryakumar Yadav b bowler 89(43) [4s-7 6s-7]"
8367,"FOUR, premeditates a paddle-sweep, then has to reach for it as Krunal bowls this well wide outside off, but somehow gets a top-edge over the keeper's head"
8368,"FOUR, drifting in on off and middle, batsman bends across and deflects it fine with a paddle-sweep"
8369,"out Lbw!! batsman steps across the stumps, swipes across the line and misses. Given out leg-before. But is this slanting down leg? That's what he's hoping for while going for the review. But as is the case, the ball's just clipping the side of leg-stump to make it stay with the onfield call. batsman lbw b bowler 31(26) [4s-2 6s-1]"
8370,"out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! This is poor from Rahul Tripathi. Really unnecessary. Looks to slog-sweep bowler and top-edges it to deep midwicket. From nowhere, Mumbai's celebrations show that they haven't given it up yet. batsman c Hardik Pandya b bowler 1(2)"
8371,"out Bowled!! There's going to be drama here, make no mistake. This is getting a bit too uncomfortable for the Royals, and when you see shots like this, you understand why. batsman has swiped right across the line of this delivery, missed it completely and lost his stumps. batsman b bowler 1(2)"
8372,"out Caught by Ishan Kishan!! Huge appeal from bowler, and batsman walks. Don't think the umpire was raising his finger initially. Anyway, this is unbelievable from the Royals. How they've found themselves in such a position after that Buttler innings is just... Back of a length, gains pace of the pitch and takes a faint outside edge through to Ishan Kishan. Massive blow to lose someone with batsman's experience. Now into the lower-order. batsman c Ishan Kishan b bowler 12(15) [4s-1]"
8373,"FOUR, flies away off the outside edge through to the third man boundary. Short of length outside off, maybe not the best option from bowler as it gives a slashing Gopal more than a fifty-fifty chance. He just needed to get something on it, which he did"
8374,"1 run, dropped by Ishan Kishan! Back of a length around off, Gopal is squared up while moving around in the crease, gets a healthy outside edge. Would've been a sharp catch. Kishan dives full stretched to his right but puts it down"
8375,"FOUR, full on off, Gopal doesn't time it perfectly but manages to drive it through the gap at extra cover. Rajasthan Royals, who almost messed up the chase at the end, have been bailed out by batsman"
8376,"FOUR, paddlescooped just past short fine leg! Once again, batsman hasn't got it off the middle but still has enough wood to get it past the fielder in the ring. Walked across very early, signaling his intentions to this fuller ball, had to fetch it from outside off but his brisk initial movement allowed him to do that, just"
8377,"FOUR, not a kind of shot that you would associate with batsman. Gets a length ball and just clears his legs to club this over mid-wicket. An agricultural hoick of sorts and it's come off"
8378,"SIX, chipped all the way! Superb stroke from batsman. Sat deep in the crease and didn't try to overhit this one. Just hit through the line and stressed on timing more than power. Served him well as it's cleared the ropes at long-off"
8379,"FOUR, silky stroke from Jinks. Was a bad ball though, full and down leg, he just got across to glance it wide of short fine leg. The outfield here is the batsman's ally once he gets past the infield"
8380,"FOUR, full and outside off, batsman bends down and spoons it over the infield, there was a man at deep point but he couldn't get there in time to stop the boundary"
8381,"SIX, up and all the way! He has been good with this shot today - the heave over mid-wicket. Shuffles across and down, gets the right length to send it sailing over the fence"
8382,"FOUR, now the finesse. Banged in and the ball was climing around off-stump, batsman arches back and ramps it over de Kock, one bounce and over the ropes. Rohit looks worried!"
8383,"FOUR, welcome, Mr. bowler. This is batsman at his best. Full delivery outside off, he has a good front foot stride, the high elbow and the straight bat - creams the drive textbook style through extra cover. None of the fielders moved"
8384,"FOUR, boundaries continue to flow.. Even bowler has conceded two in the over. A venomless short delivery that sits up for the Englishman, batsman swivels and pulls it over the square leg umpire. No protection in the deep"
8385,"out Caught by Suryakumar Yadav!! Gone! How many times have we witnessed that? Wicket right after the break. Big one for Mumbai as batsman looked in his elements today. Slowed up and got a bit of purchase as well, batsman goes for the slog sweep, the ball turns away with some bounce, the top-edge balloons towards deep mid-wicket, where SKY takes a sitter. batsman c Suryakumar Yadav b bowler 37(21) [4s-6 6s-1]"
8386,"SIX, Chahar errs by landing one in batsman's arc, it was the googly which was right in the slot, batsman goes with the spin and smashes the loft over the long-on fence"
8387,"SIX, batsman has taken over the baton after Rahane's dismissal. Runs down the wicket, gets close to the delivery and then uses his power to muscle the ball over the cow corner fence"
8388,"SIX, he just stands there and admires the shot. Darted into the slot, batsman with a cleared front leg helps himself to another maximum, smacks with minimum backlift over long-on"
8389,"FOUR, worrying signs for Mumbai. They can't afford to leak runs from both ends. batsman holds a good shape and lofts the length delivery inside out over extra cover. A calculated shot as mid-off was inside the ring"
8390,"FOUR, the angle works against bowler. He slips on the pads and that is easy pickings, batsman got some wood on that, the ball then deflected off the pad to the fine leg fence"
8391,"FOUR, batsman has had enough of pushing and prodding, makes room to a good length delivery and hoicks - off the thick inside edge and past square leg, runs away to the ropes in a jiffy"
8392,"FOUR, poor delivery and bowler knows it immediately. Drifts it way down leg and Sarfaraz helps it along the way with a bit of glove, the fast outfield takes care of the rest"
8393,"SIX, it is not Gayle but Sarfaraz who will have a piece of bowler. The cheeky right hander, goes down to play that over-the-head-scoop, makes decent connect and the ball sails into the stands"
8394,"out Caught by Parthiv Patel!! Gone! bowler learns quickly from his mistake this time. He also gives a send off to Sarfaraz. Dug in short and it was pacy, Sarfaraz swivels to play the pull but only manages a glove to Parthiv, who takes a good catch over his head. batsman c Parthiv Patel b bowler 15(13) [4s-1 6s-1]"
8395,"out Lbw!! Mo has deserved this wicket. The promotion to send Curran up the order does not work for team. The offie kept it simple, pushed it through and attacked the stumps, Curran tries a cheeky reverse sweep and is beaten for pace, struck right in front of the stumps and the umpire had no doubt. batsman lbw b bowler 1(3)"
8396,"FOUR, in an attempt to keep it away from batsman's range, bowler sprays it down leg, the left hander gets enough bat on the glance to take the ball fine and into the fence"
8397,"SIX, he's sent this to the moon! Oh, my! What a hit! Short of a length, sits up nicely for batsman who clears his front leg and goes booooom! Soaring into the skies at the deep mid-wicket region"
8398,"FOUR, timely boundary for batsman who has been looking to make a move on for some time now. Shortish and angling into him, was pulled away hard in front of square through the leg-side. ABD in the deep got across but probably timed the slide wrong. Ends up palming it past the ropes"
8399,"FOUR, full toss and you can't be bowling those at this stage to a well-set batsman. He shovels it over mid-wicket, into the gap between deep mid-wicket and long-on. Was more of a chip stroke and gets the boundary"
8400,"1 run, Kohli spills a dolly! An extremely unusually sight, especially when he is fielding in the deep. batsman mistimed this low full toss and hit it flat towards long-on. Was a regulation take for VK who timed his run forward properly, only to let it through in the end. Poor!"
8401,"SIX, smashed into the stands! Another full toss and this time, batsman makes no mistake. Wades into the slog and sends it comfortably over the ropes at deep mid-wicket"
8402,"1 run, short of a length, follows batsman who mistimes the heave towards deep mid-wicket"
8403,"FOUR, batsman inches closer to another IPL ton. Wide full toss and there aren't many worse deliveries to bowl to a set batsman. Especially with third man in the ring. batsman slices it away, well wide of the fielder in the ring and away she goes to the fence"
8404,"FOUR, cracking shot, fraction too short from Umesh, batsman stands tall, rolls his wrists and pulls it in front of square on the on-side, no need to run for those"
8405,"SIX, lovely, length ball outside off, batsman clears his left leg and heaves it back over the bowler's head, went high and sailed over long-on for a maximum"
8406,"FOUR, he almost did! Ends unbeaten on 99! batsman would have wanted that one run but then, don't think he will be too worried about not getting to the milestone. bowler missed the wide yorker marginally this time and it was sliced away, well wide of short third man and to the fence for a boundary. batsman is only the second batsman to end on 99 not out in the IPL after Raina"
8407,"FOUR, that has been muscled away, think he didn't get it off the middle of the bat, but almost sent the ball over the ropes - backed away to a length ball and went over the bowler's head"
8408,"FOUR, that's easy pickings for an in-form batsman, leg-stump half-volley and batsman whips it away behind square on the on-side for a boundary"
8409,"FOUR, that's some timing from KL, length ball at the stumps, batsman leant forward and played a one-handed on-drive - was in the air for a while but rushed past the diving fielder at mid-on"
8410,"FOUR, that's some way to welcome bowler to the crease, length ball outside off, batsman backs away and drills it through the line, one bounce and over the ropes at long-off"
8411,"SIX, you simply can't bowl short to this man - not at bowler's pace, back of a length and from round the wicket, batsman made room and swung - didn't get hold of the shot, but has enough to sail over long-on for a maximum"
8412,"FOUR, hat-trick of boundaries, short of a length and well outside off, batsman leans across and cuts it in front of square on the off-side, past AB at cover and runs away to the ropes"
8413,"SIX, hammered, tad too short from bowler, batsman swivels across and muscles the pull - high and over square leg for a maximum, turning out to be a big over"
8414,"FOUR, make that 24 off the over, length ball on the pads and it's flicked away disdainfully past short fine. team need time to breathe and they call for a strategic break"
8415,"SIX, lovely, nicely tossed up at the stumps, batsman leans forward and lifts it nonchalantly over long-on for a maximum. Pressure straightaway on bowler"
8416,"out Stumped!! That's a fine comeback from the leggie. The leg-break and he has got rid of the dangerous KL. Was it the adrenaline that was pumping inside KL? He lost his head and he has lost his wicket now. Came rushing forward, didn't spot the leg-break, beaten in the flight and the drift - swung all over the place and Parthiv has an easy stumping to his name. batsman st Parthiv Patel b bowler 18(15) [4s-2 6s-1]"
8417,"FOUR, cheeky and four, tossed up well outside off, Mayank bent down low, used the pace on the ball and lapped it fine, fine leg is very square and has no chance"
8418,"1 run, fifty for batsman. He continues his fine form.. Third of the season and this against his old team. Just a bat raise and on he goes.. Turning into the big man and batsman is happy to nudge it square on the leg-side"
8419,"SIX, fabulous shot! bowler gets wicket with this delivery but not that of batsman. Floated it outside off and tempted the batsman, batsman keeps a low base, gets low and underneath that to loft it handsomely over extra cover. Goes all the way"
8420,"out Bowled!! Timbah! What a response. He's pumped. Celebrates the wicket with a fist pump on his knee. batsman is left clueless with this delivery. Drifts in the air and lands near leg and middle-stump, batsman is caught in the crease because of the length, he then tries to maneuver with his hands, but the ball spins across to hit top of off-stump. Dream delivery for any leg-spinner. batsman b bowler 15(9) [4s-1 6s-1]"
8421,"FOUR, classy shot from Parthiv! Curran provides a floaty half volley and it's creamed through the gap at cover. Lovely timing and it raced away. team are away in style"
8422,"FOUR, the signature batsman straight drive! Like Curran, bowler also starts with a half volley. The team skipper leans forward and strokes it past the bowler and beats the diving mid-off fielder"
8423,"FOUR, batsman is off the blocks in a jiffy. Not that bad a ball, just a superb shot. Was on a length around off, he shuffled across and clipped it away sweetly through mid-wicket. Once again, outstanding timing on the shot. Nothing much you can do as a bowler except applaud the batsman"
8424,"FOUR, heaved away! The length is wrong from bowler this time, gives one in the slot for Parthiv who is ready to throw his bat at anything that's within his reach. Clubs it through mid-wicket"
8425,"FOUR, the partnership between batsman and de Villiers is now 50. Slow through the air - 81.6kph, batsman cuts off the back foot and Shami at backward point is too slow to bend down to his right. Doesn't get a hand on it and the ball reaches the fence in a jiffy. bowler isn't happy with that effort"
8426,"1 run, fifty for batsman! A different bowling action from bowler as he bowls a fullish ball outside off. Drilled to long-on for a single and batsman points at his team's symbol on the shirt before rasing his bat"
8427,"FOUR, wayward ball. Slips it down leg and batsman clips it square of the man at short fine leg. Easily put away"
8428,"FOUR, plants his back knee across off stump and swipes this slower ball over short fine leg. Almost went for six, just the one bounce"
8429,"out Caught by Murugan Ashwin!! batsman absolutely smashes this pull shot, but it goes straight to Murugan Ashwin who was standing at least 15-20 yards inside the boundary. That positioning was probably to stop the second run, which this pair has so frequently charged for to exploit the long boundary. But it works brilliantly in a separate context here. Short ball, hammered off the front foot well in front of square, it goes flat and hard - straight to deep midwicket. Ashwin comes charging across in celebration. There might yet be some more chapters to write before this game is done. batsman c Murugan Ashwin b bowler 67(53) [4s-8]"
8430,"FOUR, nicely whipped away by batsman. He's timed it beautifully, although bowler did much of the work for him by giving a gentle full ball on the pads. And then batsman gratefully picked it up backward of square, past fine leg"
8431,"FOUR, short of length delivery wide of off, it's a slower ball but on this pitch, it has come on so brilliantly onto the bat. batsman has just opened the face, that's it, but it's sped away through backward point"
8432,"1 run, Murugan Ashwin drops a skier! The nightmare in the field continues for Kings XI. Back of a length outside off, batsman looks to hoick through midwicket but gets a thick top-edge that goes way up in the air, giving Murugan plenty of time to settle underneath. Almost too much time. He makes a meal of it"
8433,"SIX, short of length delivery wide of off, punished by batsman who slaps it over extra cover. Turning out to be a great over for team"
8434,"1 run, full and wide, creamed to extra cover where Ashwin does a brilliant job of a pick-up and throw. A direct-hit might've even had him, or maybe not. He's in, well in. And that's his fifty too. The job's not done yet though"
8435,"FOUR, this won't please Ashwin one bit. Having called mid-off inside the ring, bowler bowls a low full toss and is tonked straight back over that fielder. Another chat"
8436,"SIX, and this should seal it from batsman. He gets low, bends across, moves late to the off-side and sweeps this low full toss into the crowd backward of square. Classic batsman"
8437,"FOUR, drops it down short and is smoked back down the ground. Slapped to the fence for four"
8438,"FOUR, ominous signs for team because batsman is timing them sweet and crisp. Not that full in length but he is well forward and punches it on the up. Beats the diving mid-off fielder and it's sped away to the fence"
8439,"FOUR, raining boundaries in the Powerplay. Just the kind of start team were looking for. Too full from Curran and it's hammered straight back past him and down the ground. Mid-off had no chance"
8440,"FOUR, Curran is spraying them all around. Shortish this time but at a gentle pace and leg stumpish, Parthiv just had to beat short fine leg to get a boundary. He ends up clearing that fielder comfortably with a half-pull"
8441,"FOUR, smacked straight back past the bowler! Those famous wrists of batsman and although it was aerial, bowler had no chance. Was a float up that got drilled mercilessly down the ground. Rocketed to the fence"
8442,"out Caught by Agarwal!! Clever from bowler! Sensed Parthiv giving the charge and slowed it down considerably, while also dragging the length back ever so slightly. The attempted lofted stroke ended up as a miscue and Mayank at long-off accepted the sitter with joy. team have broken through, courtesy their skipper who is actually having a fine season so far. batsman c Agarwal b bowler 19(9) [4s-4]"
8443,"FOUR, AB batsman is underway! Seam-up ball, the length is on the shorter side and batsman is quick to pounce on it. Jumps on the back foot and punches it wide of mid-off beating the fielder to his left. Excellent placement"
8444,"FOUR, nicely done! Good length, seam-up delivery, marginally outside off, batsman opens his bat-face at the last moment and runs it very fine to the third man fence. Used the bowler's pace to good effect"
8445,"FOUR, too wide from bowler and batsman punishes. Camps back and cuts it in the direction of the turn. Beats point and races away to the fence"
8446,"FOUR, four more! A desperate dive to his left in the deep from Mayank, but in vain. A length ball and batsman walked across towards off to clip it away through mid-wicket using those mighty wrists. Agarwal got a hand to it, but couldn't stop the ball from going past the ropes"
8447,"FOUR, batsman has no trouble this time. Slow, short and wide outside off. AB jumps and slaps it up and over extra cover. Easily done"
8448,"FOUR, sloppy, slippy! KL Rahul, the culprit. batsman drove this flighted delivery all along the ground to the left of long-off. There was no need to slide, but KL does that and over-does - courtesy dew? In the end, he could only watch the ball go past the ropes"
8449,"FOUR, and that's a fine start for team! Fuller delivery and has been on-driven down the ground. The full face of the bat showcased and the ball sped away"
8450,"FOUR, fuller ball on the pads and clipped away past the square leg umpire for a four. Poor from bowler. Too full and put away off the pads"
8451,"SIX, oh, he's miscued this but guess what? It's sailed all the way for a maximum. Plenty of flight from Kuldeep, Jadhav sits low and goes across the line with the spin on the swipe. Gets enough bat on it to send it into the stands"
8452,"FOUR, rank long hop and Jadhav takes full toll. bowler knows it was a bad delivery and he's disappointed with himself. Pulled his length back, Jadhav pivots back and muscles it in the gap - splitting deep mid-wicket and long-on"
8453,"out Lbw!! Jadhav's been trapped in front but he walks down the pitch to have a chat with Raina in quest for a review but nope, the Southpaw advises him against going for the review and off he goes. Eden explodes. bowler picks up his second wicket and he's keeping team in the game. Such a vital wicket this because Jadhav was looking ominous. Quicker delivery, skidded through after pitching and KJ misjudged it, ended up playing it down the wrong line and it pings him on the front pad. HawkEye's in and it says the ball is crashing the leg-stump. Good call from umpire Rod Tucker. batsman lbw b bowler 20(12) [4s-3 6s-1]"
8454,"SIX, and now he middles it.. into the crowd. Advances down, it's a googly again and this time batsman picks the bones out of it. Crucially, he went with a straight bat and not across the line. Deposits it over long-on"
8455,"FOUR, this time he knows exactly what bowler has bowled. Picks the googly, steps away from the line and opens the face on his cut past backward point"
8456,"SIX, steps out close to the pitch and launches it down the ground. May have come close to the bottom of his bat, but there's still enough for a 74-metre six"
8457,"FOUR, that's a shocking delivery. A full toss on the pads from round the wicket, that too with fine leg in. batsman can't believe his luck as he glances it to the fence"
8458,"out Lbw!! batsman given out leg-before. Now then, this is a big moment. He has gone for the review. Oh this looks close on the front-on replay. There's some turn, and batsman is well forward. So there's a chance it might go down. No, it doesn't. Per ball-tracking, it's crashing leg stump - three reds. team needed this desperately to have any hope of getting back. And they're surely back in it now. Like the previous delivery, this one turned in as well with batsman having little clue on the front foot. And this was much more adjacent. batsman lbw b bowler 16(13) [6s-1]"
8459,"1 run, short of length, batsman hops back and tucks this through square leg for his fifty. Much appreciation shown from the team dugout"
8460,"FOUR, now that's been struck extremely sweetly. Full ball around off, batsman gets the front leg out of the way and nails the drive straight of mid-off"
8461,"FOUR, what a bonus for team. Don't think they're looking to attack bowler, but he himself has presented a half-tracker. batsman happily belts the pull wide of long-on"
8462,"FOUR, advances down close to the pitch and hammers it down the ground, with bowler having to duck for cover"
8463,"FOUR, pitched up on middle, batsman swipes right across the line of it, and it somehow balloons off his leading edge over backward point. Third man was inside the ring, so it runs away for four. Back-to-back boundaries for batsman"
8464,"FOUR, really poor from bowler, who switched to round the wicket and delivered a low full toss on the pads with fine leg inside the ring. The second time he's done that tonight. Easy put away for batsman"
8465,"FOUR, 120kph, seam up delivery that's short and wide outside off. Definitely surprised batsman who was late on it, but he managed to get it off the toe-edge. The pace on the ball did the rest as it raced past a helpless short third man"
8466,"FOUR, short ball, bad ball and has been put away. Swivelled on the back leg and pulled it in front of square for a four"
8467,"FOUR, not too short but punished again. Stood up, bent his back a bit and pulled it flat towards deep mid for a four"
8468,"FOUR, the short ball ain't working here. Walks across his sticks and scoops it fine on the on-side for a four. Third four in succession"
8469,"FOUR, Russell getting a taste of his own medicine. That was a slower delivery and batsman walked across his sticks again and scooped it fine. The short fine fielder had no chance"
8470,"out Lbw!! That was a length ball and has trapped batsman plumb in front of the sticks. Nipped in from a length, batsman was trapped on the back leg and missed the line to be adjudged LBW. His bad form with the bat continues. team lose their first wicket. That was the pacy and skiddy delivery from bowler which angled in from round the wicket. batsman lbw b bowler 6(7) [4s-1]"
8471,"no run, the inside edge saved the southpaw. Length delivery angling in, batsman hopped back to defend and missed it. But there was an inside edge and that helped him overturn the umpire's decision which was out"
8472,"FOUR, on the pads, clipped away to deep mid-wicket and that has raced away to the fence in a jiffy"
8473,"FOUR, that's a buffet ball from Krishna. Sends a length delivery down leg, easy pickings for batsman as he gently shuffles across and helps it very fine. Fine leg was inside the ring and just watched the ball elude to his left"
8474,"FOUR, oh, this is wayward stuff from Krishna. Another loosener down leg and batsman tucks in the gift. Moves across, allows for the ball to arrive and glances it past short fine leg"
8475,"out Bowled!! bowler gets his man and sends the dangerous batsman packing back to the hut. He's been short on confidence with the ball in this tournament but this wicket is a much-needed boost. Poor shot from batsman, perhaps was tempted by the flight there as he leant forward aiming for an agricultural heave, didn't fully commit himself as the ball dipped in after pitching. Sneaks in with a hint of spin and rattles the off-pole. batsman b bowler 24(16) [4s-5]"
8476,"FOUR, that's a horror delivery from bowler. Slips it down leg, too easy for batsman as he bends low and sweeps it very fine, earns himself a boundary"
8477,"out Caught by Uthappa!! Talk about lapse in concentration. It happened with team and now with batsman. Just throws it away, probably has thrown his spot away as well in the Indian team for the World Cup. bowler with the golden arm; tosses it luringly outside off and batsman chases with hard hands. Slaps it uppishly and finds Uthappa at cover, who takes a good catch. batsman c Uthappa b bowler 5(11)"
8478,"FOUR, Jadhav picks the googly and lifts it over extra cover. High percentage shot against spin. Waited for the ball to arrive, lunges forward and cashes in with a nonchalant loft. All grace from Jadhav"
8479,"FOUR, now the cheekiness. How smart is Jadhav here? Nothing wrong with the delivery from bowler, it was flighted delivery just outside off but KJ cleverly went deep in his crease and opened his bat face at the last moment to guide it past short third man. The fielder gave a long chase but the ball wins the race"
8480,"FOUR, 1000 runs for Lynn in IPL! Wide-ish delivery in the channel outside off, very close to tramline, Lynn gets down on his knee and smacks it over covers, one bounce and into the fence she goes"
8481,"FOUR, back-to-back boundaries for the opener! This was slightly short in the channel outside off, batsman treks back and slaps it wide of the fielder at sweeper cover, great timing and power on that"
8482,"out Caught by du Plessis!! Rana looks to up the ante and falls in the process. It's turning out to be another season where Rana gives it away in the middle and latter half. He spotted the leg-break, made room for the lofted on-drive, didn't quite get hold of the shot, off the inner half of the bat and dragged it down the throat of du Plessis at long-on. A simple catch and the South African holds on. batsman c du Plessis b bowler 21(18) [4s-3]"
8483,"out Caught by du Plessis!! A ripper from Faf du Plessis - but what was batsman doing? First ball and he was looking to smash bowler out of the park, it was the leg-break and he didn't spot it, ended up slicing across the line, gets a thick edge that goes high and over the bowler's head. Faf charged in from the deep, kept his eyes on the ball and held on - despite sliding forward. team are losing the plot in the middle overs. batsman c du Plessis b bowler 0(1)"
8484,"SIX, cracking shot, too short from bowler, Lynn swivels across and then helps it on its way, high and over long leg for a maximum"
8485,"SIX, smashed, a flat six from Lynn, backed away to a short ball and clattered it over cover, went sailing over the ropes for a maximum"
8486,"SIX, back-to-back sixes for Lynn, tad too short from RJ, allows Lynn to rock back and pull it hard and over mid-wicket for another maximum"
8487,"SIX, hat-trick of sixes, RJ is under the pump here at the Eden - tossed up on off, Lynn came down the track, gets close to the ball and lifts it high and over long-on for a maximum"
8488,"FOUR, cheeky and four, nicely done by batsman, this was the drifter that was angled down leg, he bent down, used the pace on the ball and lapped it behind square on the on-side for a boundary, 23 from the over"
8489,"out Caught by SN Thakur!! Wickets keep coming for bowler and this is his trademark celebration on show. Pushed through with a flatter trajectory, Lynn bent down on the slog-sweep, struck it hard and flat, but didn't find the placement that he wanted. Shardul was the man at deep backward square leg, bends down low and accepts the catch gleefully. Exit Lynn, but enter Andre Russell. batsman c SN Thakur b bowler 82(51) [4s-7 6s-6]"
8490,"FOUR, .. and he's off and running with a boundary - tossed up on the leg-stump line, Russell gets forward and thumps it wide of mid-wicket - no one in the deep to stop that"
8491,"SIX, thumped, the leg-break and it has been dropped into the second tier - Too full from bowler, Russell bent down low and heaved it with sheer power - didn't middle it but the ball went a long way into the stands"
8492,"out Caught by (sub)Shorey!! One shot too many and the celebrations start in the team camp - Look at bowler go, he got Lynn first and now Russell - surely has cut short team's final score by at least 25 runs if not more. Another leg-break and Russell brought out an ambitious slog-sweep - Didn't get hold of the shot, off the toe-end and dragged it towards long-on. It was dying onto him, but Dhruv Shorey bent forward and held on. batsman c (sub)Shorey b bowler 10(4) [4s-1 6s-1]"
8493,"FOUR, nicely done, low full-toss from bowler, batsman leans forward and chips it over mid-wicket for a boundary"
8494,"out Caught by du Plessis!!Jinxed! Poor from the skipper. Length delivery and he just skied it up in the air for Faf, the ball magnet for the day, to take it at mid-off. That was a nothing shot. The bat face turned in the hands of the batsman for it to sky up. Fourth catch of the day for Faf. batsman c du Plessis b bowler 18(14) [4s-2]"
8495,out Caught by Jadeja!! And a tough learning curve for batsman is over. Slaps a shortish ball straight down the throat of the man at deep mid. That was slower and batsman despite timing it found the fielder. team have lost the plot here. batsman c Jadeja b bowler 15(20)
8496,"FOUR, that's in the air but it's wide of the fielder at deep mid-wicket. Lynn latches on to the short ball and hacks it over mid-wicket. On a bounce and over the ropes. The fielder near the boundary was sprinting across but couldn't reach there"
8497,"SIX, that's nailed over deep mid-wicket. Shimmies down the wicket and pulls the short ball over the fence for half a dozen, way back into the stands"
8498,"FOUR, drilled through extra cover! Pitched on a full length and Lynn creams it past the fielder at wide mid-off. Pressure on the bowler, 14 runs of the over already. Still 3 balls to go!"
8499,out Kuldeep Yadav Run Out!! Swinging in yorker and a run-out as the keeper lobbed the ball to the bowler who whipped the bails off with the non-stiker stranded in the middle of the crease. batsman almost fell down failing to wood the yorker and Dhoni behind the sticks did the rest. team has derailed pretty badly here. Kuldeep Yadav run out (Dhoni/bowler) 0(0)
8500,"FOUR, bludgeoned down the ground! An overpitched delivery around off and Lynn had absolutely hammered it past the bowler, no chance of stopping that. Thakur hardly had any time to react"
8501,"FOUR, looks a belter of a wicket this one. Just look at the timing on that. Minimum effort, maximum result. Was swinging into the batsman this full length delivery and batsman creams it past the fielder at cover-point. Lynn has scored six boundaries and a six, Narine none"
8502,"out Caught by du Plessis!! bowler strikes in his first over! A tossed up delivery around middle and leg, batsman looks to clear long-on with this loft but finds the fielder stationed near the fence. du Plessis is the man who takes a safe catch. Just like his previous match against team, batsman fails to fire yet again. The bowling change works for Dhoni. batsman c du Plessis b bowler 2(7)"
8503,"FOUR, good move by DK to send Rana at number 3. With two left arm spinners in team, he can get a few handy runs. This was wide outside off and Rana slaps it wide of the fielder at cover, placement was the key on this occasion"
8504,"FOUR, Lynn is looking in good touch today! Intent in his gameplay. This was short and wide outside off, the opener makes use of the width on offer and thrashes it past the man at cover"
8505,"SIX, going, going and gone! One of the cleanest strikes of the afternoon. Lynn puts on his dancing shoes and lofts it over long-on for a towering six. Could have been a maximum on any ground, anywhere in the world"
8506,"FOUR, excellent square cut by Rana! This was another short ball and well outside off, Rana sees the opportunity there and cuts it very late, past the fielder at backward point and that's four more"
8507,"1 run, fifty for Lynn, his 8th in IPL, the leg-break from bowler, but the length was short, allowed Lynn to go back and cut it towards backward point"
8508,"FOUR, lovely, RJ dropped one short and wide of off, Rana made room and then chopped it behind square on the off-side for a boundary"
8509,"FOUR, oh outside edge and it's flew past the man at slip. Outswinger from a good length, batsman tries to defend, gets a thick edge and gets away with it"
8510,"out Caught by Bairstow!! bowler gets a wicket in his first over of the season. Short of a length delivery just outside off stump, Shaw tries to punch off the back foot, the ball bounces, hits him high on the bat and the edge goes straight to the keeper. batsman c Bairstow b bowler 4(5)"
8511,"FOUR, another edge and batsman escapes this time. Hands on the head for team's fielders. It was pitched up outside off, batsman's eyes light up as he goes hard on the drive. No feet, just hands following the ball. Thick outside edge beats Bairstow to his left - who dived but it was far from him"
8512,"FOUR, smacked over mid-wicket. Rare loose ball from Rashid, a rank long hop and Iyer was so quick to read it. Hangs back and places it supremely in the gap"
8513,"FOUR, oh, poor Rashid. The ball's following him and this time he fails to stop it. Should have done better definitely because the standards he sets in the field is amazing. Shortish from Sharma, well outside off. batsman gets deep and cuts it past point. Rashid did cover good ground but ended up letting it away to the fence at sweeper cover"
8514,"2 runs, 50-stand comes up between Iyer and Pant. Slower delivery from Sharma, on the pads and Iyer whips it wide of long-on. Easy two as even Warner can't do much"
8515,"out Caught by Bairstow!! Kumar's worked Iyer out with a short ball. The team captain doesn't even wait for the umpire to raise his finger as he trudges off the field. It's Bhuvi's 100th scalp for team. Followed a full ball with a spicy short delivery, Iyer was backing away and tried to ramp it over the keeper but failed in execution. Gets a slight edge and Bairstow makes no mistake. The partnership has been broken. batsman c Bairstow b bowler 45(40) [4s-5]"
8516,out Caught by Hooda!! Proving to be a fruitful night for bowler. Comes back into the attack and gets the big fish. Bowls a low full toss and batsman looks to lift it over long-on. Gets it off the bottom end of the bat as it's miscued towards the man charging in. Hooda is the man in the deep who takes it. batsman c Hooda b bowler 23(19) [4s-3]
8517,"no run, Bairstow puts down a catch! Was a googly outside off and Morris got an outside edge as he tried to punch off the back foot. The keeper shows some generosity by not holding on to the catch"
8518,"out Bowled!! Rashid ends his spell with a wicket. Pitches this one on a tad fuller length and bowls a quicker legbreak, batsman with lack of footwork tries to punch it, can't get any connection however. The ball knocks the top of off stump and Morris is gone! batsman b bowler 4(8)"
8519,"FOUR, finally a boundary for Delhi! It has come after ages. A wide full toss by Sandeep and batsman makes sure it's sent to the boundary. Reaches out for it and slaps it past the man at cover, also manages to beat the sprinter in the deep"
8520,"leg byes, 1 run, team review against Keemo Paul! Doesn't look out though as the impact was outside leg and it was clearly sliding down the leg side. Was a slower delivery on leg and Keemo got beaten as the ball moved away to an extent. Impact - umpire's call and it's missing leg confirm the replays"
8521,"SIX, Paul has picked the bones out of this! A slower length delivery around off, Keemo lines up for it and swings it over the cow corner for a gigantic six"
8522,out Lbw!! Bhuvi has the last laugh as he gets his man. Concedes a six and comes back strongly to dismiss Keemo. Nails his yorker to perfection and traps the batsman in front of the wickets. He was looking to swing his bat but got beaten due to the hint of inswing. Out from the moment it struck his pads and the batsman doesn't even think of reviewing it. batsman lbw b bowler 7(4) [6s-1]
8523,"FOUR, a man at slip would have swallowed that. Outswinger outside off stump, batsman slashes hard, gets a thick edge and escapes"
8524,"FOUR, driven hard into the square and it bounces to the right of the man at cover, Rashid tries to hunt it down, but can't cut it off in time, he flicked the ball but it touched the rope"
8525,"out Caught by Bhuvneshwar!! Top edge, oh Bhuvi juggles but manages to take it on the second attempt. Lovely short delivery, batsman goes for the hook shot, gets a thick edge, Bhuvi takes a few steps forward and manages to hold on. Great start from bowler, got both the openers. batsman c Bhuvneshwar b bowler 7(8) [4s-1]"
8526,"FOUR, fullish and swinging away outside off stump, batsman stays in the crease and cuts hard, through cover-point and it races away for four"
8527,"SIX, what a shot! He's very good with that pick up shot, fullish and on the off stump, batsman gets his front across the line and sends it all the way over backward square leg"
8528,"FOUR, outside edge and it's escaped past the diving man at slip, fullish delivery outside off stump, Iyer plays inside the line and tries to push at the ball, gets away with it"
8529,"SIX, slower ball and smashed, batsman danced down the pitch and slogged at this, didn't catch the middle of the bat but caught enough to clear the fence"
8530,"FOUR, oh good bouncer but batsman has managed to top edge this fine to the fine leg boundary, smiles at the bowler acknowledging that it was a good ball"
8531,"FOUR, how did he cut a ball that wasn't short! Iyer gave himself room and sliced the ball square past backward point, Ricky Bhui couldn't cut it off"
8532,"SIX, lovely hit, down the pitch, lofted with the spin and way back over long-on, the leggie again, picked that from the hand and smashed it, highest IPL score for batsman"
8533,"out Caught by Bairstow!! And he nicks off immediately. Full and wide outside off stump, batsman tries to square-drive, but gets a thick edge and he doesn't wait for the umpire. bowler gets his first IPL wicket. batsman c Bairstow b bowler 40(24) [4s-4 6s-3]"
8534,"FOUR, wow! Surgical precision from Iyer. Two fielders dived but in vain. Juicy half-volley from bowler, Iyer gets his front foot across and nails the drive fabulously through extra cover"
8535,"FOUR, batsman greets Rashid to the attack with a boundary. Not the ideal start as he drops it short, batsman rocks back quickly and swats it in front of square on the leg-side. Threads the gap between deep square leg and deep mid-wicket to perfection"
8536,"FOUR, edged and flies past slip. Steaky but Iyer won't mind. Loopy delivery, almost a yorker length outside off. Iyer squeezes it and gets a healthy outside edge which eludes slip and beats short third man as well"
8537,"FOUR, welcome into the attack Mr. bowler! Back of a length delivery at 150kph, batsman swings hard and gets it off the inside edge through square leg. No fielders stationed in that region and that shall be the first boundary of the innings"
8538,"FOUR, not a great line by bowler! Short ball at the hips and batsman glances it past the fielder at short fine leg with nonchalance. All he had to is get some bat on it, which he does. The pace at which bowler is bowling makes it easy to take it away to the fence"
8539,"out Caught by Rabada!! Done in by the slower ball, chips it up to the right of mid-off where Rabada comes flying across for the catch. Clings onto it. Then clings onto Prithvi Shaw who jumps right onto him. Brilliant from Paul to turn it around for Delhi. Pressure on the vulnerable team middle-order again. batsman c Rabada b bowler 3(8)"
8540,"no run, loopy ball and slammed down the ground for the man at long-off to drop it. That was a poor drop from Munro coming in from long-off. Warner at the other end is furious as batsman didn't even stay alert to take a single. The young man is under the pump here"
8541,"FOUR, takes strike after sometime but that doesn't deter him from getting a four. Jumped on to the short ball and pulled it away towards deep mid for a four. Played it in front of square and got it in the gap"
8542,"FOUR, gift of a delivery. A full toss. And batsman laces that by backing away. Crunched it past cover for a four. Important four"
8543,"no run, and bowler ji has dropped a tough one! That was muscled back to the bowler. Quicker one outside off and was spanked back to the bowler who got both hands to it before dropping it"
8544,"out Caught by Axar!! This is proving to be a match defining spell by Keemo Paul. Ricky batsman never looked settled and his struggle comes to an end. Was a slower delivery outside off, the batsman swung his bat and got it off a thick leading edge towards backward point. Axar Patel sprints across towards his left, puts in a dive and pulls off a brilliant catch. This match is going right down to the wire. batsman c Axar b bowler 7(12)"
8545,"2 runs, starts with a length delivery and that has been lifted away over the bowler's head for a double. Fifty for batsman. This has been scratchy knock from the southpaw. Wasn't timed at all as he tried to lift that away"
8546,"out Caught by Shreyas Iyer!! The slower delivery does it again. Dada and Ponting at the dug out are roaring out loud as well. Big moment in the game. batsman looked to slap it, toe-ended it and the man at midoff back-pedalled a bit to take it. Huge, huge wicket for team in the circumstances. batsman c Shreyas Iyer b bowler 51(47) [4s-3 6s-1]"
8547,"out Caught by Pant!! The short ball does it now. The quick short ball, no room for the batter and only musters a top-edge for the keeper to cover some distance and take it at the short third cordon. Back-to-back wickets have almost sealed the game for team. batsman could have been the man for team but not to be. The ball skidded on to him and he was late on the shot. batsman c Pant b bowler 1(2)"
8548,out Bowled!! The corker yorker has got the leg pole cartwheeling here. Looked to open the face of the bat on that yorkerish delivery but missed it and the leg-stick went for a toss. team are crumbling too quickly here. Perfect yorker and the perfect result as well. batsman b bowler 3(4)
8549,"out Caught by K Paul!! And another South African is on a hat-trick. Slower delivery, batsman got under the ball and slammed the slog sweep for it to be taken at deep mid. Keemo Paul in the deep mid region gobbled it up. bowler is on a hat-trick now. batsman c K Paul b bowler 0(1)"
8550,"out Caught by K Paul!! Keemo Paul is like air. He is everywhere. An easy catch around the mid-off region. Length delivery and was heaved away off the toe-end of the blade, never went anywhere and the catch was taken easily. team going down like a lead balloon here. Totally messed up the chase in the second part of the innings. batsman c K Paul b bowler 2(3)"
8551,"out Caught&Bowled!! What's happening here? They keep getting sucked into more miseries team. Short ball, looks to pull and the top-edge was taken by the bowler himself. The keeper also went for it as no one called for it. But bowler kept his balance to take it. batsman c and b bowler 2(4)"
8552,"out Bowled!! Backs away, creates room and misses the fullish ball for team to complete the formalities. From 101 for 2 to 116 bowled out. team jump to second in the points table. batsman b bowler 0(1)"
8553,"FOUR, batsman knows only way! The aggressive way. Sees the width on offer and slices the shortish delivery over point. Enough wood on it as the ball races away to the boundary"
8554,"FOUR, successive boundaries for the Englishman. This was on his pads and batsman flicks it wristily over square leg. Very VVS-esque shot that and it's four more for the opener"
8555,"SIX, stand and deliver! Length delivery around off and batsman stays put and lofts it straight over the bowler's head. Straight as an arrow and that shall be a maximum"
8556,"FOUR, slightly short, batsman quickly responds by jumping back on the cut. But it's not really that short. So he's not in control, gets a thick outside edge and it runs away through the vacant slip region"
8557,"1 run, low full toss on middle, eased down to long-on"
8558,"SIX, bashes this into the crowd. The way he took stance, it was clear he fancied a bite of bowler. Sensing this, bowler blinked. He dropped it short and was muscled over midwicket"
8559,"FOUR, only slightly short, not a lot, but batsman has gone so far back in the crease, using the depth of it superbly. He's manufactured this pull shot through midwicket, and then succeeds in beating deep midwicket too"
8560,"out Caught by Rabada!! Fuller, slower and wider, batsman reaches out for it and drills it straight down long-off's throat. That's the opening Delhi needed. Because he was stretching for it, batsman wasn't as balanced as he would've liked to be. And so, that affected - or rather hindered - the power he was able to generate. Went flat to Rabada who made no mistake. batsman c Rabada b bowler 41(31) [4s-5 6s-1]"
8561,"FOUR, bottom-handed whip and it finds the gap between mid-wicket and mid-on for a four. On a length, batsman swipes across the line and gets it into the gap for it to dribble away"
8562,"FOUR, poor channel from Umesh, slips it down leg and batsman swivels on the back foot to pull it fine for a four. Was a gift of a delivery from Umesh"
8563,"SIX, did he hit it that well? Got hold of the short ball and just rolled his wrists over that. The ball seemed to have flown away over fine leg for a sixer. Might have been a bit of a top-edge"
8564,"SIX, that's another monstrous hit from batsman! Shimmies out of his crease and smokes this well flighted delivery into the cow corner orbit with a dash of swagger"
8565,"out Stumped!! Gets greedy does batsman and throws his wicket away. Didn't pick the top-spinner outside off and his wild bat swing only meets with thin air, PP completes the formalities behind the stumps sans any fuss. batsman st Parthiv Patel b bowler 21(9) [6s-3]"
8566,"FOUR, smartly played by batsman! Gets down on one knee and paddles the full legbreak in the gap through short fine, Siraj puts in a dive after a long sprint but ball wins the race"
8567,"FOUR, gets as low as he can, picks the flighted delivery from outside off and swipes it over square leg for his first boundary"
8568,"FOUR, why bowl a short quick ball when the flighted deliveries are doing the job for you. Surya stays back, lets the ball come and cuts to the right of short third man"
8569,"out Caught by Navdeep Saini!! This is a big wicket for team, the move to bowl bowler has worked. Just as SKY was looking very determined to take team home, he gifts his wicket. Flighted delivery spinning away outside off stump, not easy to loft the away-spinning ball on this surface, goes for the extra-cover region but hits it too high and very straight. Long-off moves to his left and swallows the ball to delight the away camp. batsman c Navdeep Saini b bowler 29(23) [4s-2 6s-1]"
8570,"FOUR, I have no idea how Hardik has cut this all the way towards widish third man. Short ball yes, but looked like Hardik was slightly late on the shot, but he actually middled it, just fell an inch inside the rope, poor start to the over for team"
8571,"FOUR, in the airrr, Southee was at mid-on, runs back but only manages to fingertip it to the boundary. Clever batting from Hardik, he lofted that deliberately in the air knowing there was no one in the deep, bowler bowled very full this time and paid the price. Hardik went back and across for this ball, he went so deep in his crease that he would have been out hit wicket had he been in line with the stumps"
8572,"FOUR, don't understand this field. Mid-off in at this stage to a player who loves lofting the ball straight. bowler dishes out a full ball and Pandya happily powers it over the bowler's head"
8573,"out Caught by (sub)Milind Kumar!! Yikes! That was an ugly hit with no real intent from Krunal. Ugly because his front foot was pointing towards cover and when you do that, there's no way you can flick the ball with control. Just a chip in the end to this back of a length delivery and deep mid-wicket ran forward to take the catch. In fact he caught that with one hand despite going with both hands. Crowd cheers as they see Pollard walk out. batsman c (sub)Milind Kumar b bowler 11(21) [4s-1]"
8574,"SIX, now then, now then, it's not a well timed hit but it timed well enough to just clear long-on. Shortish delivery spinning away, Pandya goes back and powers the ball in the air and gets a vital maximum"
8575,"FOUR, is that the game already! Poor short ball wide outside off stump, Pandya slaps it hard and splits long-off and deep mid-wicket to perfection"
8576,"FOUR, batsman has killed the game. Or should I say bowler? Why dart the ball when it's turning! Pandya slogs and hits it well enough and wide of long-on"
8577,"SIX, take a bow Hardik. This time bowler actually gave it some air, Pandya got under the ball and muscled it hard over wide long-on"
8578,"FOUR, fuller ball and has been laced off the front foot past cover for a four. Fuller, wider and batsman got enough bat on it to send it away into the gap"
8579,"FOUR, and off the outer edge. Toe-end may be. Cruel game for the bowlers. Length delivery outside off, batsman looks to mow it across the line and gets it off the edge"
8580,"SIX, that was a golf hit! That has gone into orbit. Outtaaaaaaa here! Short ball and batsman has picked the skeletons out of that. Muscled over deep square leg for a sixer. Hardly transferred his weight on to the back foot to slam it away"
8581,"no run, length delivery and has been pushed back to the bowler. Umesh went for the throw after picking the ball up and misses. Had he hit, QDK wasn't even trying to get back. The batter had chipped out to push it back to the bowler"
8582,"SIX, this is silly from bowler. You can't be bowling short and wide to batsman. batsman stays back and square cuts the ball over deep point fence for a sixer. Easy peasy!"
8583,"FOUR, this is pick your spot bowling from bowler. Short delivery outside off, pleading to be hit and batsman slaps it over cover. team are off to a flier"
8584,"2 runs, full on leg-stump and batsman's swept that to the left of backward square who fumbles to allow the second"
8585,"FOUR, sits down on one knee, picks the length early and swipes it over square leg with sheer timing"
8586,"FOUR, in the slot for batsman Sharma! Full and plenty of width outside off, batsman lashes on it with a crunchy drive through extra cover, superbly timed!"
8587,"SIX, 143ks dug in short at the batsman, batsman picks the length slightly late but he has such wonderful hands and he clouts it for a 77-metre maximum over mid-wicket"
8588,"out Bowled!! Wicket off the first ball for bowler. He can do no wrong today. Lands the offbreak miles outside off stump and thus, batsman Sharma thinks he can cut that off the back foot, wasn't to be. The ball spins a long way and clatters quickly into middle and leg. batsman b bowler 28(19) [4s-2 6s-2]"
8589,"out Lbw!! Plumb. batsman's caught on the crease and bowler is chuffed to bits. Pitches this on a length and gets just the right amount of turn into the left-hander, batsman's stranded on the back foot and that's crashing into middle and leg. Played all around it and paid the price. batsman lbw b bowler 40(26) [4s-5 6s-2]"
8590,"SIX, charges out of his crease, gets closer to the pitch of the delivery and clubs it many-a-mile over long-on"
8591,"SIX, make that two in a row! Closer to the pitch of the delivery again and batsman has nailed that over cow corner for a flat maximum"
8592,"SIX, tossed full outside off and SKY pumps it for a 73-metre maximum over extra cover, well timed!"
8593,"FOUR, stylish shot to get off the mark! A tad too straight in line, full as well and batsman wrists it away past the diving forward square leg fielder. Timed it sweetly"
8594,"SIX, top-edge and over the keeper. Oh, in fact, it's gone all the way. Fortune favouring batsman at the moment. Pandya bends his back and digs it into the pitch, batsman went for the pull and gets a fat top-edge to his benefit"
8595,"SIX, shouts of ""ABD, ABD"" were ringing across Wankhede and batsman treats them by dismissing this into the deep mid-wicket stands. What a strike! Gee. Picked the short delivery early, it sat up well for him too. Easy-peasy as he nails it off the meat and smokes it over the fence"
8596,"no run, was it a chance for de Kock? He's having a off-day behind the stumps today. Well, looks like there wasn't any edge there. So, won't go down as a drop. It was tossed up luringly outside off, batsman wanted to have a piece of it as he threw his bat without any feet movement but the ball straightened and beats his outside edge"
8597,"FOUR, batsman brings out the innovation. Spotted the leg-break early, gets low and reverse-sweeps it past short third man. Brilliant!"
8598,"SIX, Ali tees off and oh, that's a poor effort from the fielder at long-off. Surely should have done better as he parries it away for a six. Looped up just outside off, Ali got underneath it and blasted it - didn't get it off the middle but fortunately gets away. Seemed like SKY was the fielder, who made a meal of it"
8599,"SIX, and he spoils the over with a maximum. Pandya gives a bit of flight, Ali extends his arms and clubs it over long-on. He had to fetch it from well outside off but Ali's got some long levers. Clean strike from the southpaw"
8600,"FOUR, slapped through extra cover. bowler goes full, overpitches it in the process just outside off. Ali stays deep and creams it hard, beats a desperate dive from Chahar at sweeper cover. Flawless timing from Ali"
8601,"SIX, he's started to tee off here. bowler misses his mark, bowls a slower ball on a length. Ali was just waiting for this, backs his muscle power and smokes it over cow corner"
8602,"SIX, wow! This is a big over for team. Second six and 17 has come off it. bowler fails to nail the yorker, misses it by an inch and Ali makes him pay. Gets under it and dumps it over cover"
8603,"3 runs, lofts the low full toss over the bowler's head and a misfield from Pollard allows the duo to take a triple. Fifty for batsman. It has been labourious by his standards but now is the time, when he can cash in"
8604,"1 run, waits on the slower delivery by hanging on to the back foot but inside halves the ball away into the on-side for a single. Fifty for batsman as well. This has been one cracking innings from the English all-rounder. Has delighted the crowd with some luscious big hits. Even Kohli gets up and applauds this quick fifty"
8605,"out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! Fifty and gone. Slower delivery and batsman was early into his uppish tuck. batsman was through with his shot too early and the ball soared away for it to be taken at deep mid by Pandya, who moved across to his left and took it. End of a game changing innings from Mo! team will take this with both hands. batsman c Hardik Pandya b bowler 50(32) [4s-1 6s-5]"
8606,"SIX, ABD kneels and he will eventually bring you down on to your haunches. Stays low, and scoops the ball over fine leg for a huge six. Full marks to the anticipation and execution"
8607,"out Caught by Rohit!! The slower delivery does the trick. Tucked the batsman up with an off-cutter, which bounced on the batter, who got a leading edge and was taken by the man at cover. tried to close the face of the bat a bit but was undone by the clever change of pace. Top-clas from bowler. batsman c Rohit b bowler 0(2)"
8608,"FOUR, misses the yorker, not by much and batsman was quick to squeeze the ball between mid-off and cover for a four. Genius on show"
8609,"FOUR, again bowler misses the yorker and batsman shows his wizardry. Gets deep, opens the bat face and pile drives the ball past cover for a four. Superb from Mr. 360"
8610,"SIX, misses the yorker again, this time bowler, and batsman has hammered it over deep square leg for a big six. Sized up for a length ball and got a full toss to scream it away"
8611,out batsman Run Out!! 1 run completed. That was superb from Pollard. A bullet of a throw from deep long-on and has found ABD short. batsman slogged it away towards the long-on area and wanted to come back for a second only for him to sent back by Akshdeep Nath. ABD tried to turn back but the direct hit found him short. batsman run out (Pollard) 75(51) [4s-6 6s-4]
8612,"out Caught by de Kock!! Charges out, looks to loft the slower ball away and top-edges it for the keeper to run towards the short fine area and take it. This again won't please the skipper. QDK had his eyes on the ball and took it nicely despite the ball going away from him. batsman c de Kock b bowler 2(3)"
8613,"out Caught by de Kock!! And another one for the Slinga! Slower delivery cutting across, batsman throws his bat at it and skies it up. The keeper again calls for it and catches it near the point region. This is extremely poor from team. Throwing it away at the end of it. batsman c de Kock b bowler 0(2)"
8614,"out Caught by de Kock!! Body blow by bowler! Cracking delivery and batsman has been sent back early. Was angling across from a good length around off, held its line after pitching and bounced just a bit more than batsman anticipated it to. He was looking to force it through the off-side and got cramped, thereby getting an inside edge through to de Kock who took it with ease. Just the kind of start team were looking for. batsman c de Kock b bowler 8(9) [4s-1]"
8615,"FOUR, just clears mid-on! Was a miscued lofted flick from Parthiv who saw the length full and tried his luck. Wasn't off the middle of the blade, yet managed to get it past the leaping fielder in the circle"
8616,"FOUR, slapped over mid-wicket! Fractionally short and Parthiv picked the length early, didn't bother going back as he pulled this comfortably over mid-wicket. Clean strike"
8617,"SIX, just over deep mid-wicket! Kishan was the fielder there and he leapt as much as he could but it went well over him. A taller fielder, Pollard perhaps, could have had a better chance. Take nothing away from Parthiv though, this is a cracking stroke. Picked the slower ball early and though he had to fetch it from outside off, did so with a cross-batted slap"
8618,"FOUR, deft touch this time from Parthiv! Uses the pace of bowler and steers it with an open bat face. Splits the slip and gully fielder to pick up a boundary. Smart batting"
8619,"FOUR, more runs! This is a good counterattack from Parthiv. Not in control this time as he goes for a flashy drive, slices it wide of the slip and once again, it's wide of gully and races away to the fence"
8620,"FOUR, clubbed over point! First confident shot from batsman for the night. Short and wide, he stands tall and bashes it square through the off-side. Didn't connect cleanly enough but had enough wood to clear the infield with ease"
8621,"no run, Parthiv Patel was in some trouble here but puts in a dive as the throw at the bowler's end misses. Might have been 50-50 if it hit. Shortish delivery that struck batsman on the thigh pad as he got cramped on the flick"
8622,"out Caught by Suryakumar Yadav!! What a soft dismissal! For all the shots he's played so far, Parthiv departs in tame fashion. It's been the story of his IPL career by and large. Gets attractive starts but perishes after the Powerplay. This was a cleverly bowled off cutter from Hardik and Parthiv wanted to go aerial through his favorite region square through the off-side. Misread the pace and ended up chipping it straight to Yadav at backward point. batsman c Suryakumar Yadav b bowler 28(20) [4s-4 6s-1]"
8623,"FOUR, cheeky from ABD! The reverse paddle and it's actually risky with a slip in place but the South African connects fairly well. Well wide of backward point to get a boundary"
8624,"FOUR, french-cut from batsman and it almost shaved the off-stump. Nervy times for the South African these. This good length delivery nipped in a bit and batsman was cramped for room as he went for the cut - too close for comfort. Thick inside edge goes teasingly past the stumps to the fine leg fence"
8625,"SIX, effortless flick from Ali and it sails over the deep mid-wicket fielder's head for a maximum. It was floated on the pads, Ali's propensity on leg-stump balls is well documented. Just stays inside the line and latches onto the freebie"
8626,"no run, was there an edge? QDK can't collect it cleanly and yes, there was a definite bottom-edge there. Googly from Chahar, dropped short and it was spinning away from Ali. He went for the pull a tad early and feeds a tiny edge but QDK messes it behind, grassing it onto the floor"
8627,"SIX, this was in the air for a long time, for a second the fielder at deep square leg looked in business but the breeze here in Mohali takes it away over the ropes. Probably, Archer - the fielder - was standing a few yards inside the rope, had he been near the boundary, he would've had a better chance of catching it. Big misjudgement from him there as batsman gets away. It was banged in short, batsman after a few sighters takes it on and pulls. Didn't time it as he would've liked but luckily, the ball sails over the ropes for a maximum"
8628,"SIX, after a few sighters, batsman gets into action. bowler lands a length ball, sits up nicely for batsman to free his arms. Whacked elegantly over long-on. Back-to-back sixes for the Universe Boss. He's starting to tee off. Ominous signs for team"
8629,"FOUR, first boundary for the opener has come in the 12th over! batsman makes room for himself, shimmies down the wicket and lifts the shortish delivery over mid-off. The fielder was inside the circle and all he needed was to clear him, which he does. A sigh of relief for KL"
8630,"FOUR, finally a boundary for batsman! He was trying to find this gap since quite some time. Goes down on his knee and finds the fence with a nicely timed sweep shot, first one of the innings for him"
8631,"SIX, that's huge! Short length by Sodhi, batsman waits for it and smokes it over deep square leg for a massive six. Just the kind of delivery he was looking for in order to break the shackles. Sodhi has just given him that"
8632,"SIX, thumped down the ground! A googly by Sodhi, batsman reads to perfection, treks back and bludgeons it over long-off for the second maximum of the over. Pressure on Sodhi!"
8633,"FOUR, time for the batsman show! Goes down on his knee and scoops the length delivery over fine leg. The fielder was inside the circle and the opener clears him comfortably. That almost went the distance"
8634,"SIX, Bowled a rather decent spell in the last game against team but he's back to leaking runs. Bowls a gift of a full toss on the pads and batsman with utter ease flicks it over deep mid-wicket. The timing was bang on!"
8635,"SIX, bowler has run out of ideas! batsman moves miles away from the leg stump and the bowler tries to follow him. Goes full though and the batsman goes inside out to clear covers with this exceptional shot. Wow!"
8636,"FOUR, super shot! Saw the length slightly short and though there wasn't room, he created some by backing away and punched it sweetly wide of the mid-off fielder. Raced away to the fence. Another 50 for batsman this season! This has been brilliantly paced, was really slow to begin with but is shifting gears with ease now"
8637,"out Caught by Jofra Archer!! bowler has the last laugh! Was carted around in the last over but responds by breaking the partnership. Was the slower ball and quite full as well, batsman wanted to carve this through the gap square through the off-side but ended up slicing it straight to Archer at backward point. Simple catch and it ends a decent knock from KLR. So, the gamble works for team and Rahane. batsman c Jofra Archer b bowler 52(47) [4s-3 6s-2]"
8638,"FOUR, launched over extra cover! Spoils an otherwise good bowler over. A trifle too full and a bit of width as well, batsman stood still and lifted it easily over the infield. Clean strike"
8639,"out Caught by Rahane!! Mistimed and picks out extra cover. batsman has been done in for pace here, it's a low full toss but quite brisk and hence, isn't able to connect properly. Ends up cue-ending the shot towards the off-side where the team skipper takes a tumbling catch, diving forward. This is a fine passage of play for the visitors. batsman c Rahane b bowler 5(6)"
8640,"out Bowled!! The leg stump has been flattened! Outstanding over from Archer, just three runs and has taken two wickets too. After a series of fiery pacy deliveries, he opts for the slower one, the back-of-the-hand option and batsman clearly hasn't picked it at all. Saw the length very short and backed away for the pull but the ball never really arrived. Ends up getting an inside edge that damages the woodwork. Brilliant fightback from the Royals. batsman b bowler 0(2)"
8641,"out Caught by Buttler!! The team innings is falling apart at the final leg, thereby derailing that flourish that they were looking for. The well-set batsman is the latest casualty. Made room for the big shot but Kulkarni followed him with a slower ball on a good length. Couldn't free his arms properly and ended up skewing the loft high into the night skies at deep mid-wicket. Not easy, these high catches but Buttler is a pro in the outfield. Pouches the skier with ease. batsman c Buttler b bowler 40(27) [4s-2 6s-2]"
8642,"FOUR, useful boundary for team! Width on offer and shortish as well, batsman was waiting for any room to be provided and sliced it away wide of backward point. Third man had no chance of cutting it off"
8643,"SIX, crunched! Solid hit from the team skipper. Picked the slower ball and the shorter length helped, he sat deep on the back foot and clouted it merrily across the line. Superb batting!"
8644,"FOUR, this is erratic from Kulkarni. Serves up a low full toss outside off, batsman reaches out and throws his bat. Gets a thick outside edge but the third man is inside the ring and it beats the fielder at 45 before running away to the fence"
8645,"SIX, terrific cameo from batsman to finish! Premeditates the yorker and walks across the stumps early, thereby putting Kulkarni off. The result is a full toss that's paddle scooped beautifully. All the way over fine leg"
8646,"FOUR, very predictable from Kulkarni. He's bowling an array of slower balls, batsman anticipated it and made room to spank it in the pocket between short third man and backward point"
8647,"SIX, woah. This is very uncharacteristic from batsman. Let's the world know about his cheekiness too. Spotted the short ball early, arched his back and ramped it beautifully over the keeper. Normally, it's all about power but not on this occasion"
8648,"byes, FOUR, messy. Archer is fuming as Samson fumbles behind. Can't blame him much because he got an iffy bounce. Off-pace delivery, snaked away sharply outside off. The keeper couldn't get his body behind the line and it runs away to the boundary"
8649,"out Caught by Samson!! Archer gets the prized scalp of batsman. He's such a smart operator and gives team the first breakthrough. It was on a back of a length, decked away with some extra bounce. batsman with a tentative and loose poke at that, it brushes the outside edge and Samson makes no mistake this time. Stunned silence in the crowd as team have lost the in-form batsman. batsman c Samson b bowler 30(22) [4s-2 6s-3]"
8650,"SIX, batsman at his very best. He's very good against spin and shows no respect whatsoever to Sodhi. Flighted with more air, batsman lowers his stance and lifts it straight down the ground. The timing is really good and it goes all the way for a six"
8651,"FOUR, what a shot. Gopal drags it short, batsman is extremely quick to read the length. Pivots back and hammers it through mid-wicket. Stuart Binny from the deep sprints across and dives, but ends up parrying it to the boundary"
8652,"SIX, launched over long-off! batsman is looking in superb touch today. Tosses it enticingly just outside off, batsman props forward and clobbers it disdainfully for a maximum"
8653,out Caught by Jofra Archer!! batsman perishes in his quest to clear long-on. Goes down on his knee to thump this one over the fence but miscues it completely. The ball goes miles up in the air and Jofra in the deep settles underneath the skier. Waits for an eternity but does well to position himself under the night sky as he reverse cups it to perfection. batsman c Jofra Archer b bowler 26(12) [4s-1 6s-2]
8654,"SIX, dispatched over long-on! Clear intent from batsman, doesn't want to settle bowler settle. There is a long-off in place, so he charges down the pitch and goes in the other direction. Over long-on and it was struck so well that it soared into the second tier"
8655,"out Bowled!! The sweep has brought about his downfall this time. After crunching the previous two straight to the fielder, batsman goes for it again but misses it completely. That it was a carrom ball that straightened on off may have had to do with the error. Or it may not have. But it's floored the off stump all right. batsman b bowler 27(21) [4s-2]"
8656,"FOUR, great timing from batsman as he whips this delivery backward of square. Back of a length on middle and leg, batsman climbs onto it. A boundary at the start of his innings"
8657,"FOUR, poor from bowler. Bowls a hit-me on leg-stump and Tripathi tickles away neatly in the gap between deep square and fine leg"
8658,"1 run, flighted around off, Tripathi pulls to deep mid-wicket and that'll be his first fifty this IPL"
8659,"out Caught by Agarwal!! The carom ball has done the trick again! It was pushed around fifth stump channel and Tripathi intended to clear the fielder in the deep, went for the loft but sliced it off the bottom half straight into the mitts of Mayank Agarwal at long-off. batsman c Agarwal b bowler 50(45) [4s-4]"
8660,"out Caught by Miller!! No Mohali heroics from Ashton batsman tonight. Unfortunately he doesn't have the time to play the nudge-and-nurdle game, prefers to attack and uses his long levers to tonk bowler into the stands, wasn't to be. Connects right off the cue end and Miller ain't dropping that at long-off. batsman c Miller b bowler 0(1)"
8661,"out Caught by Rahul!! KL Rahul is such a brilliant fielder and boy, he makes catching look so easy. A pacy short ball outside off, Archer's so tall that he could actually stay flat-feeted and swipe at it with full throttle, hit that real hard but flat it went to the right of long-on. KL Rahul sprints across and controls the slide before tumbling over to complete the catch. batsman c Rahul b bowler 1(3)"
8662,"FOUR, batsman's off the mark with a boundary! A gentle short delivery on the stumps, batsman waits on the back foot and pummels it over mid-wicket with brute power"
8663,"SIX, there's nothing brute about this shot. Just a serene pick up off his hip, just watched the ball spear into the leg-side and did well to get inside the line and help the cherry on its way for a 75-metre maximum over fine leg"
8664,"out Caught by Shami!! batsman's ordeal comes to an end and the 20-year old is absolutely pumped. Couldn't have asked for a better debut. Rolled his fingers over this full delivery and asked batsman to fetched it from outside off, the aimless slog loops up high in the air where Shami runs around to take a fine catch from short third. batsman c Shami b bowler 26(21) [4s-1]"
8665,"SIX, length ball in the slot for batsman, he stands rooted to the crease and powers it into the cow corner orbit with tremendous timing"
8666,"SIX, no missing this time around. Watches the ball like a hawk, sets himself deep inside the crease and smokes the full ball straight back over the bowler's head"
8667,"out Caught by Agarwal!! Pacy full ball from bowler, followed the batsman and fired it around the pads, Gopal had made room outside off but the extra pace from bowler skid onto the bat and hit the toe-end on the loft, a simple chance for Mayank at long-off. batsman c Agarwal b bowler 0(1)"
8668,"SIX, scorching hit from batsman! Prowled down the track in a jiffy and although this wasn't that short, he picked it up beautifully. Propelled it over deep mid-wicket with a shovel-flick. Such power! He's looking ominous tonight again"
8669,"FOUR, another beautiful shot! batsman is turning it on. Sees width on offer and just eases it through backward point. Just relied on timing and boy, didn't he time the pants off this one! Sweeper tried hard but was never chasing it down"
8670,"FOUR, team - 2, team - 0 this season! A comfortable victory for the home team, win by 12 runs. batsman sliced the full ball one-handed and managed to get it over extra cover, Mayank Agarwal chases the ball to his left but he couldn't arrest him momentum and ended up sliding over the ball"
8671,"out Caught by Pooran!! bowler has got Jos batsman as his maiden IPL wicket. What a moment for the 20-year-old left-arm seamer. He's deceived him with the off-cutter here. It was slanted across well wide of off, batsman - almost premeditatedly - wanted to slug it through midwicket but goes through with it too early. Went up off the toe-end and the keeper Pooran took a fine catch running back towards fine leg. Big celebrations from Punjab, particularly Ashwin. batsman c Pooran b bowler 23(17) [4s-1 6s-2]"
8672,"FOUR, full and wide, Tripathi grounds his back knee and carves it up and over backward point. Beautiful shot"
8673,"FOUR, that's gone through Shami's hands at short third man. Poor effort. Length ball outside off, the angle induced the error from Tripathi as he drove away from the body. Went quickly off the outside edge to Shami's left, should've been comfortably stopped"
8674,"FOUR, uses the pace superbly. Murugan was mostly flat through the over, so Tripathi anticipated a similar trajectory, stayed back to the ball and then dabbed it fine"
8675,"FOUR, it's been helped away quite fine from batsman, capitalizing superbly on just a bit of misdirection from bowler who strayed ever so slightly on middle and leg"
8676,"FOUR, now this is class batting. He's chopped a ball - that was on off stump - and sent it really fine into the third man boundary. What makes it an even better shot is that it was the off-cutter from bowler, so it's not as if he had a lot of pace to work with"
8677,"1 run, wide on the crease again is bowler, straightens it on off stump, it takes a thick edge from batsman before rolling to short third man"
8678,"out Caught by Bairstow!! One brings two!! bowler uses his height and bowls the scramble seam short of length delivery outside off, Faf made room early and was looking to go over cover, gets a faint outside edge and YJB does the rest behind the stumps. batsman c Bairstow b bowler 45(31) [4s-3 6s-3]"
8679,"FOUR, risky shot and he gets a boundary! Expects the googly and jumps deep inside the crease, plays the cut at the last instant and the edge flies wide of Warner at slip"
8680,"FOUR, streaky! A full throttle cross bat swing against a length delivery and batsman sends a huge chunk of top-edge on that, one bounce and over the ropes at third man"
8681,"out Lbw!! batsman has been given out lbw off Rashid. team review: Fair delivery, looks to be pitching in line and no bat involved. Umpire's call on hitting and he has to go. Hasn't been at his fluent best and this shot is a firm proof of that. Just looks to slog without having a real sense of where the ball pitched and he loses his shape in the process, swings way too early and Rashid's floaty legbreak clonks him in front of middle. Technology shows it to be brushing the leg bail. Just enough. batsman lbw b bowler 13(13) [4s-2]"
8682,"out Lbw!! batsman's out lbw. Another review from team: Legal delivery and there seems to be no bat involved. Has it done too much though, the googly? He's struck in line with off and there's another umpire's call on hitting. Shaving the top of leg peg. OUT!! A rather simple set-up this from Rashid, bowled the wrong 'un and gave it ample flight to draw Jadhav on the front foot. The batsman clearly didn't pick the variation and his forward stride meant he was struck adjacent to middle and leg. batsman lbw b bowler 1(2)"
8683,"out Caught by Shankar!! Nought for batsman. Been strangled with a slew of dots and he lets the pressure get better off him. A slower full ball outside off, batsman didn't really have the pace to force the uppish drive but he goes for it and chips a dolly of a catch to Vijay Shankar at cover. batsman c Shankar b bowler 0(4)"
8684,"FOUR, slower ball again but batsman has second guessed bowler there. Waited deep inside the crease and pounced on the width to flay it behind backward point"
8685,"no run, ripper from Rashid, absolute ripper. So good was the ball, that they feel compelled to go for a review after batsman is beaten on the outside edge. He's missed this by inches. Only clipped the trouser on the way through. Oh well, team have retained their review because ball-tracking shows it to be umpire's call on off stump. I'm sure they weren't appealing for leg-before there"
8686,"FOUR, slower ball outside off, there was enough width for batsman to free his arms and he does so by slapping this through backward point"
8687,"FOUR, that shall release some pressure. batsman throws his hands at a wide-ish delivery as a thick outside edge is induced. It flies over Warner at slip and races away to the third man boundary. First one of the night for team!"
8688,"FOUR, Faf breaks the shackles! Stays put in the crease and lifts the length delivery right over the bowler's head. Can't keep a fielder there and that's a four for the South African, his first one"
8689,"FOUR, team are either scoring in boundaries or not at all. This one was a loosener on the pads and batsman clips it past Khaleel at short fine leg. Although the pacer puts in a dive, he finds it difficult to get his hand to it, all the way to the fence she goes"
8690,"FOUR, that shall give him some confidence. A booster! This was an overpitched delivery by Sandy and Watto caresses it through extra-cover. Beats Williamson who was stationed inside the circle and sends it away to the boundary"
8691,"SIX, crack made the sound! Such a sweetly timed shot that was. batsman waits back in his crease, reads the slower short ball and thumps it over the cow-corner for six runs"
8692,"FOUR, shouldn't have given him the third over. Khaleel is become a touch predictable now. Overcompensates by going too full outside off, batsman creams it through covers for an elegant boundary"
8693,"SIX, that shot was all about timing! Minimum effort and maximum result. batsman shimmies down the wicket and lofts the flighted delivery against the spin. The timing was such that it just about manages to clear Warner at long-off, beautiful"
8694,"1 run, 50-run stand up between the openers as batsman tucks this one through mid-wicket off an inside edge"
8695,"FOUR, both batsmen are dealing in boundaries now. They've got a hang of the wicket. batsman backs away and slices the shortish delivery past the fielder at point, four runs for the Aussie international"
8696,"FOUR, welcome into the attack, Mr Rashid. batsman goes down on his knee and sweeps the floated delivery with all his might. So much power in that shot, four more for team"
8697,"SIX, skips out of his crease, isn't close to the pitch of the delivery but Faf doesn't back out; just goes through with the loft and pings it right over the leaping fielder at wide long-on"
8698,"out Bowled!! A hint of uncertainity consumes Shane batsman. He was on the back foot, trying to cut this off his off-stump but the ball doesn't turn as expected and grips a touch before crashing into off peg. Smart bowling from bowler as he landed it in line with off to keep batsman honest. batsman b bowler 31(29) [4s-4]"
8699,"FOUR, the timing off the very first ball, it's like he's turned up after an hour's batting in the nets. Fuller than a length on middle and leg, some shape for bowler but batsman whips it with such class through square leg"
8700,"FOUR, full ball on off, drilled into the pitch and bounces over Thakur's head before racing away to the ropes"
8701,"FOUR, right off the toe-end from batsman as he slashes at a wide length ball. Balloons over backward point, and beats a stiff effort from Tahir at third man as he couldn't bend down enough to cut it off"
8702,"SIX, swivels on the back foot and pulls it handsomely over deep mid for a sixer. Superb hit as he was quick to pick the length on it"
8703,"SIX, and batsman is in some hurry now! Kneels down and slog sweeps it over the widish long-on region for a sixer. They are racing towards the target"
8704,"out Caught by Billings!! The teamR may be in the 3s, but that's not bad enough for bowler to deny himself the marathon-to-nowhere celebration. And he's earned it with a ripper of a leg-break - pitching on a length, drawing batsman forward in classical style, only to spit up a touch more off the pitch and take the splice through to the keeper. batsman c Billings b bowler 7(11)"
8705,"2 runs, too straight again, but batsman manages to nurdle it softly enough through square leg. And the softness gives him the second, and his fifty -- talk about making the most before you HAVE to go back home"
8706,"FOUR, proper slice. He steps down, steps away and makes the length right into his slot to carve it away with a lot of bottom hand -- into that one-shot distance now .."
8707,"out Caught by du Plessis!! Ah, that desire to unleash your inner Dhoni, I0$ desire to smack big when singles could do just as well. Well batsman falls for just I0$. So he rushes down, tries to hoick one downtown, but in the end ends up just too close to the pitch of it, miscuing it big time to a backtracking mid-off. batsman c du Plessis b bowler 13(16) [4s-1]"
8708,"SIX, oh well batsman will do THE Dhoni. It was full, allowing him to come forward and then free up his hands to whip the tonk long, deep, over cow corner. 6 wickets | 19 balls remain .."
8709,"FOUR, he's waited on this slower ball, and then just chipped it back over bowler's head. Superb from batsman, first to watch it like a hawk and then to have the composure"
8710,"FOUR, short and wide, it's met with a punishing slap over extra cover. Deserved the treatment it got, really poor delivery"
8711,"FOUR, awful from Thakur. Just bonus runs. Full toss outside off, batsman simply lays his bat on it and finds the gap through extra cover"
8712,"FOUR, short of length outside off, batsman steps to the leg-side to add to the width that was on offer and carves it over extra cover. team have raced to 44 in four overs"
8713,"FOUR, kneels down and slog sweeps it behind square for a four! That was spilling down and has been helped on its way"
8714,"FOUR, this pocket-sized dynamite is exploding and taking team down to the smithereens here. Reverse swept over backward point for a four. He is in a hurry"
8715,"FOUR, the entire repertoire of shots is out there! The exhibition mode is on. Tossed up delivery and was driven into the covers for a four"
8716,"FOUR, bowler's stocks are on a free fall. Short, slow, batsman gets into position and pulls it over short fine leg for a one bounce four"
8717,"FOUR, and that is fifty for batsman! He has wasted no time today to get going. 45th Fifty plus score for batsman. Flat-batted it down the ground and got it over mid-on for a four. On a track where batters have struggled for timing, he has looked in supreme touch"
8718,"out Caught by du Plessis!! Fuller, slower delivery and has hit it straight to the man at mid-off. Backed away, toe-ended it and could not infuse any momentum on the shot to hole out. But he has done his job. team strike but seems a little too late in the context of the game. Change of pace has accounted for another wicket though. batsman c du Plessis b bowler 50(25) [4s-10]"
8719,"out Caught&Bowled!! That has happened all evening long. Flatter outside off, stopped and bounced on the batter, batsman goes through with his punch and hits it back to the bowler. bowler does his celebratory run. team get a quick second wicket. But they need a horde of them now to even think of making a match of it from here. batsman c and b bowler 3(5)"
8720,"FOUR, charges out, goes through with the shot and gets it over the bowler's head for a one bounce four"
8721,"FOUR, too short, too wide, carved away between point and cover point for a four. Got the room and got the boundary to get off the mark"
8722,"FOUR, strays on to the pads from over the wicket and has been tickled away fine for a four. team will take these"
8723,"FOUR, fetches it from outside off and has swept it past square leg for a four. More of a hacked sweep to get it past the fielder"
8724,"FOUR, takes it from the sticks and gets it between short fine and square leg for a four. More off the inner half of the bat but that was enough"
8725,"out Bowled!! Quite a ripper from Chahar, pitching leg and hitting off. Along the way, it brought Iyer tentatively forward, then beat him with the dip, before spinning past his outside edge. Mumbai Indians are all over the Capitals. batsman b bowler 3(6)"
8726,"out Bowled!! Knocked up clean. batsman goes for a very un-Kotla-approved drive - you know, away from his body, on the up - missing the line completely and with bowler making it worse with the extreme jag back in off the pitch. And off-stump's on a cartwheel. And so are Delhi's hopes tonight. batsman b bowler 7(11)"
8727,"FOUR, and another ventilator-shot - the kind that just about keeps a chase alive. It's another slower-wide combo, but batsman's not getting fooled (any longer). Throws his bat out and slices it away over extra cover"
8728,"SIX, dishes out full pace and goes 73 meters. It's right in the slot too as Morris lines up and tonks it straight back. Two balls, two hits and Delhi's asking rate falls down by an entire run .."
8729,"SIX, 111.4kph. Picks the slower one, picks his slot and picks the maximum. His hands were always swinging, with the legs going away and making the space to -- in lofting it way over long-on"
8730,"out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! Yup, the slog was always on the way. bowler knew, oh he surely did, taking pace off his millionth full-cutter tonight. Surely Morris knew THIS was coming too, but with the teamR touching 20, he had to go for the smash. So he clears his front leg, doesn't really get under the length but still swings, dragging it off the under-edge to a running in long-on. batsman c Hardik Pandya b bowler 11(9) [6s-1]"
8731,"out K Paul Run Out!! Well it can get worse. bowler - if his yorker doesn't get you, his direct hit will. batsman just dug it out down the pitch but Paul nevertheless was half way down the pitch. bowler fielded, lined up, aimed, waited, aimed better and nailed the throw at the non-striker's. It helps when Paul gives up and stands to watch it as well. K Paul run out (bowler) 0(0)"
8732,"out Bowled!! Full, all-pace, dead straight on middle. Well, certain things in life are just too good. This one was better than that good. Poor batsman, he tried backing away to carve it through sweeper, but ended up missing it all ends up. It's middle's turn to get uprooted. batsman b bowler 26(23) [4s-1 6s-1]"
8733,"leg byes, FOUR, loses radar. Well down leg, and batsman gets a tickle off his pads, under Quinton's rather lazy dive as well"
8734,"1 run, dropped - Pollard of all people, and the simplest take of them all. batsman goes on a knee, swings, top-edges, skies. Pollard meanwhile runs in from long-on, casually, settles, gets both palms and then lets it pop out"
8735,"SIX, oh there's the crunch. Another swing, and this one's surely into cow corner. Latches onto the slower one, getting under it and pumping it deep, very deep"
8736,"out Caught by Pollard!! It's a new entrant into the Dinesh Karthik school of catching - taking blunders after dropping lollies. And this is tough-er, with batsman throwing his hands at a wide one and inside-outing the carve over extra cover. Pollard's at the boundary - running to his right, taking it palms pointing sideways. batsman c Pollard b bowler 9(8) [6s-1]"
8737,"FOUR, hangs back on that slower and wide ball to slam it off the front foot. Didn't preempt and got the gap on the off-side for a four"
8738,"FOUR, picks the bones out of that dead meat of a slower ball! Charges out, gets hold of the length and goes through with the lofted hit to send it packing through the covers. Was aerial and landed a few times before the fence"
8739,"SIX, out of the crease in a flash and so was the ball. Tossed up delivery and batsman charged out to heave it over long-on. Big six. batsman has put on a show so far"
8740,"FOUR, oh superb shot. Drifting in on leg stump, and batsman just whips it over midwicket. It was too full from Jayant, and so he was right to the pitch of it. Didn't have to worry about playing against the turn"
8741,"out Bowled!! That looked a good shout for leg-before, and probably would've been given. But the umpire didn't need to bother eventually, as batsman managed to drag it back into the stumps somehow. Leg-break that straightened on middle, batsman missed his reverse-sweep and was struck low on the pad. It then ricocheted onto his gloves and was deflected back into the stumps. batsman b bowler 35(22) [4s-5 6s-1]"
8742,"out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! Holes out at long-on. Advanced down for a big shot, not quite getting to the pitch of the leg-break, so it came right off the toe-end from Shaw. With the hardness of the ball fading, and with both openers dismissed, it's getting difficult for Delhi now. batsman c Hardik Pandya b bowler 20(24) [4s-2]"
8743,"out Bowled!! Yorked! 108kph from Krunal again as he fires it in from round the wicket, and it slips right underneath batsman who was late on the ball. Knocks over the base of off stump. His struggle at the crease, worth 9 balls, ends. batsman b bowler 3(9)"
8744,"FOUR, classy from batsman. Displaying pure elegance. Half-volley from bowler at 149.4kph, immense bat-speed from batsman as he props forward and times the drive sublimely through extra cover. Just rocketed away to the fence"
8745,"FOUR, gets as low as possible and scoops the full ball to the left of the keeper, timed it well and the pace on the ball took care of the rest"
8746,"FOUR, slower ball bouncer and SKY had just ample time to pick that off the back foot, he arches slightly and ramps it over the keeper with a touch of delicacy"
8747,"out Caught by Pant!! Excellent reflexes from Pant, KG has his man! Goes wide of the crease and digs the short ball into the surface, doesn't get as much bounce and the ball grips enough to mess SKY's plans to scoop it over the keeper. Takes the toe-end and flies to the right of Pant who adjusts nicely to pouch it safe on the dive. batsman c Pant b bowler 26(27) [4s-2]"
8748,"FOUR, that's a gimme from bowler! 144ks slipping down the leg-side, KP helps it on its away with a fine tickle off his pads to the fine leg fence"
8749,"FOUR, fuller, wider, squeezed, four! Bowls it quick and full, the quicker hands of the batter come into play and squirt the ball past point for a four. Much needed one"
8750,"FOUR, does he have the hands of an artisan? Because that was crafty. Length delivery at the sticks, batsman creates room and just opens the bat face at the last moment to run it down past the short third fielder"
8751,"FOUR, walloped! The latex-laden iron wrists come into play and whip the ball away between long-on and deep mid for a four"
8752,"SIX, slower delivery and batsman has smacked it over long-off. The whirlwind of the arms into the shot and it took the ball sailing into the stands. Length balls are supposed to go the journey. Hardik is just being the postman..the most powerful one I suppose"
8753,"SIX, patent those quick strong tentacles! Low full toss, missed the mark by an inch and has to pay for it. Whips it over deep backward square for a sixer. Cruel stuff from the batter. Four inch perfect deliveries and you miss one ball and are made to pay for it"
8754,"FOUR, misses the mark again and overcompensates with a full toss. That was helped on its way over the short fine fielder. Hardik hasn't been missing anything though. Anything in his range has been disappearing"
8755,"SIX, wow wow wow! The helicopter has crash landed into the hearts of team fans. That was a superb blow. Stays deep in his crease, and those steely wrists take the ball over the fence"
8756,out Caught by Pant!! And bowler has his man. The pacer's ego was hurt. And he retorts with a bumper. batsman is late on it and the ball scooped up for the keeper to take it. Superb bouncer as it was at the body and cramped the batter for room. batsman c Pant b bowler 32(15) [4s-2 6s-3]
8757,"FOUR, length delivery just outside off and has been whipped from there. Difficult shot to call but was a hybrid of the helicopter that his brother had played a few balls back. Bisected the gap between deep square and deep mid"
8758,"FOUR, throws his bat at a length delivery and gets it past the man at point for a four. team are running away with the show here"
8759,"FOUR, 8000 runs in T20s for batsman, reaches the milestone in a streaky fashion. Pitched up just outside off, batsman throws his bat hard seeking for a swing downtown, gets a thick inside edge which misses the stumps and runs away to the fine leg fence"
8760,"FOUR, Morris misses his mark and batsman dispatches it duly to the fence. Hurls in a low full toss just outside off, batsman strides out and drills it - skews it off the bottom part but enough to beat mid-off"
8761,"SIX, connects and connects well. This time gets on top of the bounce of this length delivery, takes on the short ball and hacks it with ferocity into the deep square leg stands. This should get him going"
8762,"FOUR, doesn't get it where he intended, however still collects a boundary. Back of a length delivery, holds up a touch on the pitch and batsman is through his pull short early. Ends up trimming it off the cue-end past mid-off"
8763,"SIX, short and butchered into the crowd at deep square leg. Nothing delivery from Paul, went short but it lacked pace. batsman was taking a stride down the pitch and it sits up pretty well for him. Launches it powerfully for a maximum"
8764,"no ball, SIX, what was that? Seemed like it slipped out of Paul's hands. Delivers a waist-high full toss, batsman gets into a great position and slams the pull towards deep square leg. Morris, the fielder was setting himself near the fence but it soars over his head for a six. It's called a no-ball and it also brings up the 50-run stand between batsman and de Kock - their third consecutive half-century partnership"
8765,"out Bowled!! Peach from bowler. Absolute peach. Knocks over batsman's middle-stump with a ripping leg-break and he's off. 150th wicket for bowler in IPL - only the second bowler to achieve that feat. What a start for him and team draw first blood. It was pitched on middle and leg, batsman was waiting on the back foot and misjudges it. It also stayed low and spun sharply to make it difficult for the team captain as he was rooted to the crease. batsman b bowler 30(22) [4s-3 6s-1]"
8766,"out Lbw!! batsman misses a sweep and is trapped plumb in front. He doesn't even bother to review and walks off. So, the promotion not working for team. Always dangerous to sweep someone like bowler, who is a skiddy customer and very accurate. batsman premeditated it, sank low and it just zipped through quicker to rap him on the pad. Too quick for the Australian as he failed to get any bat on it. Umpire Nigel Llong raises his index finger and he's spot on. It was crashing the middle stump and Mumbai have lost two wickets in two overs. batsman lbw b bowler 2(4)"
8767,"FOUR, picks the gap does Quinton batsman, it was full and in his zone - he goes down on one knee and hammers it over mid-wicket to ping it in the gap between long-on and deep square. Smart batting!"
8768,"out de Kock Run Out!! Needless stuff from Mumbai. Will this prove to be a game-changing moment? SKY cut this flat delivery straight to Rabada at backward point and he instantly ambled forward before aborting his sprint midway down the pitch, de Kock though was committed on the run and he kept racing to the other end seamlessly. Rabada spotted the hara-kiri and fired a smart throw to Pant who relayed it back to the bowler to catch de Kock a country mile short of his crease. de Kock run out (Rabada/Pant/bowler) 35(27) [4s-2 6s-2]"
8769,"1 run, dropped first ball! 140ks away swinger from bowler and batsman was caught poking without any feet movement, a thick edge flies to the right of Stoinis at first slip who gets a hand but fails to cling onto it"
8770,"leg byes, FOUR, inswinger on middle and leg, batsman hops and gets a fine tickle on the thigh pad and bowler's pace takes care of the rest"
8771,out Caught by Kohli!! bowler is thrilled to bits and he totally deserves all of it. A full inswinger and batsman's lack of feet movement meant he chipped the drive straight down the throat of Kohli at mid-off. Came right off the cue end. batsman c Kohli b bowler 1(2)
8772,"FOUR, clears his front leg and thrashes the pitched up delivery past the non-striker. Brute power from batsman!"
8773,"FOUR, this short ball sits up nicely outside off and Rana takes full toll of it, maintains solid base and swat-pulls it in the gap through mid-wicket"
8774,"FOUR, short ball on leg, Rana goes down on his knee and hacks it over square leg"
8775,"FOUR, goes the other way round! Changes grips and goes for the reverse hit, ends up getting a top-edge that flies over short third man. Four more for the left hander"
8776,"no run, run-out chance missed! batsman is struggling out in the middle. The required run rate is out of their reach now! He was trying to flick the slider but got struck on his pads. Rana wanted a single but the striker wasn't up for it. Nitish was almost halfway down the track and had bowler collected the throw from Parthiv, it would have been curtains for him"
8777,"FOUR, short and punished! Width on offer outside off, Rana plays a upper cut and sends this loosener to the boundary at deep point. Still no six in this innings"
8778,"out Caught by Negi!! That brings an end to batsman's struggle. Finally! This innings has actually taken the life out of the chase. Too much to do! Guess even Russell can't do anything from here on. A short ball around off, batsman goes for a pull and mistimes it horribly. Negi at deep square leg takes a comfortable catch and out walks Dre Russ to a huge cheer from the crowd. batsman c Negi b bowler 9(20) [4s-1]"
8779,"FOUR, Rana keeps getting those boundaries! team need a few more of these. Was a loopy legbreak down the leg side and the left hander sweeps it past the fielder at short fine leg, getting a move on. Slowly but surely"
8780,"SIX, first six of the innings! Any guesses, who has hit it? It's Dre Russ and that's his 31st six of the tournament. A floated delivery outside off, the batsman goes down on his knee and pumps it over wide long-off for a flat six"
8781,"FOUR, square-cut! Short in length outside off, Russell makes room and absolutely powers it past the man at point. That went to the boundary ropes before any of the fielders could blink their eye"
8782,"SIX, just look at the power of this man! This wasn't middled, whatsoever. Was a loopy delivery around middle and leg, Russell goes down on his knee and pumps it over long-on"
8783,"SIX, successive sixes for the big man! The crowd is loving this. Russell takes on the leggie and smokes it over his head for a massive six, couldn't have hit it any straighter"
8784,"SIX, hat-trick of sixes for Dre Russ! His arrival at the crease has infused some life in this chase. Should have come much earlier. Another juicy legbreak by bowler and the power-hitter sends it sailing over the long-on fence for six more. This was the cleanest of the lot. 20 runs of that over"
8785,"FOUR, boundaries flowing from both ends now! Rana goes deep in his crease and bludgeons the length delivery past the man at long-on. Good connection there!"
8786,"SIX, Rana brings up his fifty in style! Latches on to the short ball and smokes it over long-on for a massive six. His 8th IPL fifty, this is insane!"
8787,"SIX, in the previous over Russell was striking 'em big, it's Rana in this one. A juicy full toss around off and Rana has hacked it over deep mid-wicket for another towering six. He's asking for a waist-high no ball but replays confirm it wasn't one"
8788,"FOUR, hammered! Russell pounces on the width on offer and slams it past point. His front foot was in the air like a flamingo when he connected this one"
8789,"SIX, 150 up for Kolkata Knight Riders! Pitched up around off, Russell reaches out for it and tonks it over long-off - possibly for the longest six of the night. Chants of Kay, Kay, Aar all round the stadium!"
8790,"SIX, bowler goes the distance! Pitches this one on a full length around off and Rana goes down on his knee to pound it over long-off, over the fence comfortably"
8791,"SIX, that's a home-run! Goes for the slower one and concedes six more. Rana goes deep in his crease and towers it right over the bowler's head. It's raining sixes, literally"
8792,"FOUR, 18 runs of bowler's final over! team need 43 off the remaining two. Full in length outside off, Rana pounces on the opportunity once again and thumps it over the infield at extra cover. That almost went the distance. Dre Russ back on strike"
8793,"SIX, finally gets one right! Short in length and Russell makes sure to send it over the deep mid-wicket fence. Slapped for a flat six by the big man. So much power behind that shot"
8794,"SIX, anothe fifty for the incredible Hulk! This is the second fastest fifty in IPL 2019. Right into the slot this length ball and it's been smoked over the bowler's head for another magnificent blow"
8795,"SIX, what a match this is proving to be! One of the best of the season. Right into the slot yet again and Russell who's watching the ball like a hawk powers it down the ground. The power behind that blow would be enough to clear the fence. 24 runs needed of the final over"
8796,"SIX, four sixes were needed off the final 4 balls and here's the first one of the lot. A floated delivery around off, Russell holds his shape and tonks it over long-on, just clears the fence"
8797,"out batsman Run Out!! Russell walks back after playing a gem. So near yet so far. He did all that was possible, but even that wasn't enough. Swings this one to deep mid-wicket and finds him short at the bowler's end as Kohli fires in a rocket throw at the bowler's end. batsman run out (Kohli/bowler) 65(25) [4s-2 6s-9]"
8798,"FOUR, makes room, creates his own width and smashes the length delivery through covers. Simple cricket!"
8799,"FOUR, connects this time and although it hasn't met the middle, batsman's muscled it in the gap between mid-on and mid-wicket to send it racing along to the turf"
8800,"FOUR, gets a hint of width outside off, batsman throws the kitchen sink and the top-edge flies to the third man fence in a giffy, no chance for the fielder in the deep"
8801,"SIX, team beat team by 10 runs! Let me take a breather! An offbreak by Moeen and Rana ends the match with a maximum by smoking it down the ground. Not enough though as the Royal Challengers clinch their second win of the season"
8802,"out Caught by Parthiv Patel!! Sees batsman making room and pounds the short ball wide of off-stump, batsman couldn't control his instincts having cleared his front leg way too early, finds a thick top-edge on the swat pull. All Parthiv Patel needed to do was amble back a few inches to pounch the catch, good pace from bowler. batsman c Parthiv Patel b bowler 18(16) [4s-4]"
8803,"FOUR, stands tall and slaps a 137ks good length delivery past Virat Kohli at mid-off, played it with a flat bat and managed to pierce the gap between mid-off and extra cover"
8804,"out Caught by Kohli!! Juggling take by Virat Kohli. team have three, bowler has two. Pinned this full ball at the base of off-stump asking the youngster to go aerial if he can, Gill obliges and seeks to loft it over the infield but doesn't get any timing on that. Skews it off the cue end and it loops up over mid-off where Kohli gathers the rebound with his left hand after having juggled it twice on the first attempt. batsman c Kohli b bowler 9(11) [4s-1]"
8805,"FOUR, errs in length a fraction and Rana is onto it in a flash. Sees the ball dip right in his arc (fuller length) and thumps the drive square over backward point"
8806,"FOUR, lovely shot by Rana! Pitched on a full length outside off, Rana eyes the covers boundary and lifts this one over the infield. No fielders in the deep and that shall be four runs for the left hander"
8807,"FOUR, there you go! batsman breaks the string of dots with a sublime boundary. Makes a hint of room, stays leg-side of the full delivery and clobbers it through extra cover with ease"
8808,"no run, team's LBW review. bowler gets this to rip in big, beats batsman's flick and finds his front pad. Now, it's struck him in front of leg, it's hit the knee roll as well in a massive stride. But it's not needed much convincing for the bowler or DK to take it up. In fact it's missed the leg-stump by another cool two stumps"
8809,"SIX, imperious from batsman. Russell peppers it short, batsman climbs into a great position and seizes on it. Muscling it some ten rows back over deep square leg. Dismissive from the Indian captain"
8810,"SIX, bowler offers a little bit of flight and Ali goes big. Down on his knees, gets maximum connection and pummels it over long-on."
8811,"FOUR, that's fortuitous for Ali. bowler fires it in, Ali was setting up for a wild slog and goes hard. It cuts him for room and the batsman gets a thick inside edge which shaves the leg-stump and runs away to the fine leg fence"
8812,"SIX, smoked over deep mid-wicket. Kuldeep flights it teasingly outside off, Ali sinks low and gets under it to smack it all the way for a maximum"
8813,"FOUR, finesse followed by power. So smart from Ali, saw the quicker ball and stays rooted to the crease. Uses the pace and opens his bat face to guide it in the pocket between backward point and short third man"
8814,"1 run, biffed away to long-off and that brings the 50-run stand between the duo"
8815,"1 run, fullish just outside off, batsman drives it to mid-off and takes the single. Fifty for batsman, his 37th half-century in the IPL and he gets a rousing reception from the Kolkata crowd. The team dug-out stands and applauds, batsman waves his bat around to soak it all in"
8816,"FOUR, leading edge and it balloons over short third man. Got to feel for the bowler, set him up really well. Good length delivery, seaming in and just straightens off the pitch. batsman was aiming for an across-the-hoick and lost his shape. Thick edge and gets away fortunately as it soars over the fielder's head before rolling away to the fence"
8817,"FOUR, another edge and another four. Shortish and moved away just enough, Ali swings his bat and gets an outside edge which loops over the keeper"
8818,"FOUR, hammered past long-off. Flighted outside off, Ali lowers his stance and reaches out to smack it in the gap. Even Dre Russ can't stop that"
8819,"SIX, Ali is teeing off now. Reaches his fifty in style. His 3rd IPL half-century. Slower and Kuldeep went wider of off, Ali goes low and hacks it powerfully over cow corner"
8820,"FOUR, wow! Ali is full flow here. Kuldeep is not learning. Pitches it up in the slot, Ali keeps a solid base and dumps it straight down the ground"
8821,"SIX, it's raining fours and sixes here at the Eden Gardens. Kuldeep is being taken to the cleaners. Looped up just outside off, Ali shuffles across and blasts it over long-on"
8822,"SIX, wow! This is brutal hitting from Ali. Third six off the over. Again Kuldeep hurls it quick and in the arc for Moeen, who waits deep in his crease and tonks it over long-off. ""Merciless"" is the word which pops up on the giant screen"
8823,"out Caught by Prasidh!! And bowler has the final laugh but the damage has been done. What a knock from Ali. He's put team in a prime position. Kuldeep went round the wicket and slowed it up, Ali sits low and attempts a big heave. Miscues it big time and skies it as far as long-on. Prasidh neatly settles under it and some respite for team. batsman c Prasidh b bowler 66(28) [4s-5 6s-6]"
8824,"FOUR, swivel-pulled past short fine leg. Off-pace delivery from bowler, too short and down leg. batsman pulls it hard and places it in the gap"
8825,"FOUR, squeezes the drive in the gap between cover and point. Wide yorker from bowler, batsman gets his bat down quickly and times it superbly to pick up his second boundary of the over"
8826,"SIX, thumps it straight down the ground. Nothing delivery from bowler, pitches it up and in the zone for batsman, who extends his arms and goes with a clean bat swing to send it all the way for a six"
8827,"SIX, tripe. Drags it short and batsman is so quick to latch onto that. Rocks back and dismisses it way back into the deep mid-wicket stands"
8828,"SIX, he's getting close to the hundred now. Krishna sends down a length delivery, easy-peasy for batsman. Just stands tall and dispatches it over long-on"
8829,"FOUR, shot of the innings so far. Flamboyance from batsman. Krishna corrects his length and wafts it full outside off. batsman bends low, chases it and drives it off the meat through extra cover. It just zoomed away to the fence in a jiffy"
8830,"FOUR, it doesn't matter for batsman. He joins the party as well. Walks across his stumps, waits deep and absolutely spanks it wide of long-off, who gives up the chase. Another massive over, 19 off it"
8831,"FOUR, Kuldeep is having a forgettable outing. Slower short ball, batsman pivots back and pulls it uppishly. Lands in front of Kuldeep at deep square leg, who perhaps gets caught in two-minds. Doesn't attempt a catch and neither does he gets his body in the line. It sprang up and loops over his head to the fence"
8832,"SIX, swatted down the ground for a maximum. Full and in the swinging zone, batsman gets forward and murders it straight down the ground for a maximum"
8833,"FOUR, the moment has arrived. Hundred for batsman. His first this season and look at him go. Leaps up, roars in delight and brandishes his bat. Even the Kolkata crowd are going bonkers. Special knock from the Indian captain. Shuffles across his stumps and whiplashes it through mid-wicket. Kuldeep's miserable day continues as he fails to stop the ball near the fence"
8834,"FOUR, ah, you don't nail yorkers better -- 144kph on the base of off. Parthiv desperately jams his bat down, somehow getting an inside tickle past his stumps, and there's nothing fine leg's running dive can do to stop it either"
8835,"out Caught by Shubman Gill!! Finally, he's been dismissed. Fullish on middle, probably a tired shot from batsman as he can't middle this swipe. It comes off the bottom and picks out Shubman at deep mid-wicket. batsman c Shubman Gill b bowler 100(58) [4s-9 6s-4]"
8836,"FOUR, gets away. Krishna bangs it short again outside off, which Patel throws his hands out to - more in getting out of this non-self-imposed shell - and slaps it powerfully over point. It also helps his cause that it is the tiny Piyush Chawa fielding there"
8837,"out Caught by Nitish Rana!! Parthiv and a slog can't be kept away for long. He'd tried it against Prasidh's pace and taken blows on his tummy, he does against bowler, only for a top-edge. One-kneed, stepping away from his stumps and then swipes across the line. Gets only height on this miscue, for Rana - at deep mid-wicket - to run and juggle. batsman c Nitish Rana b bowler 11(11) [4s-2]"
8838,"FOUR, hard pull, straight to deep mid-wicket. Yea, simple, single. But no, Gill messes up, bending low a little too casually and letting the ball slip through"
8839,"SIX, sits up short. And Nath isn't hanging around waiting, takes it off the front foot and muscles it uppishly over deep mid-wicket"
8840,"FOUR, 143.8kph. And batsman's being given a real workout here -- this time undoing him on a flick across the line, only for the genuine leading edge flying away through an empty slip cordon"
8841,"FOUR, loopy dip, but batsman's just too smart. He runs down, maybe yorking himself in the process, but why bother when you have bottom-hands as good as these .. drills it straight down"
8842,"FOUR, more flight, this time drifting wide outside off. batsman moves the other way, piling on the overcook to carve it away through sweeper"
8843,"out Caught by Uthappa!! Well this was coming. Nath was scratching around, playing a couple of shots every ball, and he succumbs to it again. It's more of a skidder this time, cramping Nath for room as he pulls across the line, only to sky the top-edge. Uthappa runs in for it, so does Russell and neither call. But Uthappa's just a touch quicker, plucking it from right over Russell's nose. batsman c Uthappa b bowler 13(15) [6s-1]"
8844,"SIX, good feet use in coming down the pitch and then he milks his form. Swings, lofting a hoick over long-on, and just over the fielder's jump"
8845,"FOUR, fifty for batsman. Second against Rajasthan this season. Can this be a match winning one? He knew fine leg was square, so he walked across his stumps and scooped the slower delivery to the vacant fine leg fence"
8846,"SIX, smashed! Right in the slot for batsman - full and angled into the pads, he had made room and then his arms came down at a great speed to send the ball sailing over deep mid-wicket"
8847,"FOUR, he must be relieved. bowler tries a leg-cutter and ends up bowling a full toss, Suryakumar takes a step out to get under it and slams it straight back, one bounce and over the ropes"
8848,"out Caught by D Kulkarni!! Gone! He had no choice but to go after the bowling. There is plenty of batting still left for Mumbai. Slower short of length delivery and Suryakumar is backing away, all cramped up he tries to pull but only manages a top-edge to deep backward square, Kulkarni covers ground to his right and takes a well-judged catch. batsman c D Kulkarni b bowler 34(33) [4s-1 6s-1]"
8849,"out Caught by Stokes!! Back to back wickets for Rajasthan. Two new batsmen at the crease. Not what Mumbai would have wanted. batsman needed to be smarter and batted through. He decides to take on Gopal's googly and miscues it horribly towards long-on, Stokes settles under it and he ain't dropping those. batsman c Stokes b bowler 65(47) [4s-6 6s-2]"
8850,"1 run, Archer drops his second catch of the match! de Kock scored 65, how much will Hardik score? He had slogged the length delivery to deep mid-wicket where Jofra puts down a sitter. Not a great day for him in the outfield"
8851,"SIX, insult to injury! Short of a length around middle and leg, batsman stays put and hacks it over deep mid-wicket for a 98m six. There wasn't much power behind the shot, it was the timing that was sublime"
8852,"out Bowled!! bowler has the last laugh and boy look at him, he's pumped! After bowling a length delivery the left arm pacer comes back strongly to get KP with a slower one. batsman never really read it and was too early in his shot. Tried to play across the line as the off-cutter went through him and took down the sticks. batsman b bowler 10(7) [6s-1]"
8853,"FOUR, nicely done! batsman's off the mark with a boundary. That was all about precision. A length delivery angled across him and the Australian all-rounder guides it through the gap at point and short third man. Couldn't have placed it any better"
8854,"FOUR, first one of the innings for Pandya! Makes the most out of the pace on this ball. Shuffles in his crease and flicks the ball over backward square leg. No fielders in the deep and that shall be a boundary for Hardik"
8855,"FOUR, edged away to the fence! Angled across the batsman outside off, Pandya throws his bat at it and gets an outside edge past Samson. Although the keeper dived, he couldn't quite reach there. Can't keep a slip either with just 10 balls to go"
8856,"2 runs, third dropped catch by Archer! It's proving to be a disastrous day for him. Pandya had top-edged the slog to wide long-on where the lanky pacer puts down another sitter. Unbelievable!"
8857,"SIX, stand and deliver! On a length around off, Pandya lines up for it and clubs it right over the bowler's head. Just manages to clear the fence"
8858,"out Lbw!! Rajasthan review against Hardik! Looks very close but might probably be umpire's call. In fact, it's out. Pitching in line, impact in line and it's hitting the leg-stump. Terrific yorker by Jofra as Hardik couldn't connect his flick. The ball struck the sole of his shoe and replays confirm that he's a dead duck. batsman lbw b bowler 23(15) [4s-2 6s-1]"
8859,"FOUR, top-edge and four, pushed through quicker and sliding down leg, batsman was down on his knees as he swept, off the top-edge and went wide of the fielder in the circle at short fine"
8860,"out Caught&Bowled!! Innocuous dismissal for batsman, lovely stuff from Shreyas - this was the wrong 'un, batsman came down the track, didn't get close to the ball, with bat and pad close-by, he pushed with hard hands, a simple lobe back at the bowler and it's celebration time amongst the Royals. batsman c and b bowler 5(7) [4s-1]"
8861,"SIX, Mumbai Indians post a competitve score of 161/5 as batsman finishes it off in style. Gets in a good position and tonks the length delivery across the line. A home-run over deep mid-wicket and Mumbai will be pretty satisfied with the end score"
8862,"1 run, a chance and Jofra Archer can't quite hold on, it was always going to be tough - he came running in from long-on, slid forward, goth both hands and then the ball bounced out. A mistimed heave from batsman as he looked to break the shackles - got it horribly wrong and nearly was dismissed"
8863,"FOUR, cracking shot, tad too full from Dhawal, batsman takes a step forward and then drills it back at the bowler, too pacy though and Dhawal has no chance in stopping it"
8864,"FOUR, lovely, tad too short and wide of off, batsman came down the track, made room as he did so and cracked it square past cover-point for a boundary"
8865,"FOUR, hat-trick of boundaries, Dhawal tried to follow batsman as he came down the track, too short though and it's helped off the pads - over short fine and rolls away to the ropes"
8866,"SIX, beautifully played, poor ball from Dhawal, short and at the stumps, batsman swivels across and then pulls it high and over backward square leg for a maximum"
8867,"FOUR, cracking shot, too full and too wide of off, batsman gets well forward and drills it over cover, couple of bounces and over the ropes"
8868,"leg byes, FOUR, this is poor bowling from bowler, might not go against him, but it's still a boundary against the team. Too full and on Suryakumar's pads, he was looking to flick and missed, brushed the pads and beat the diving keeper"
8869,"FOUR, that's a poor ball to end the over, short and on batsman's pads, he gets inside the line and pulls it fine - past Archer's dive at short fine"
8870,"SIX, much needed for Suryakumar and Mumbai. Picked the carrom ball on the sticks, cleared the front leg and smoked it through the line straight back over the bowler"
8871,"FOUR, Sanju wasting no time, gets going with a first-ball boundary. Latches on to the length delivery and pulls it through mid-wicket without much hassle, beats the sprinter in the deep quite convincingly"
8872,"FOUR, two in two for batsman! Uses the pace on this short of a length delivery and glides it past the fielder at short third man. The dive by the man inside the ring wasn't able to stop the ball from making it to the fence"
8873,"FOUR, batsman taking on the Pandya brothers. Makes room for himself and lofts the tossed up delivery straight over the bowler's head, four more for the youngster"
8874,"FOUR, beautiful shot! Goes inside-out and times this fullish delivery over extra cover. Was timed so neatly that it almost went the distance"
8875,"FOUR, promising start here from batsman. A couple of boundaries already. This is flat at the stumps, and he's down on one knee to put the slog-sweep away through deep midwicket"
8876,"2 runs, short-arm pulls this wide of long-on, placed it well enough for a couple. Oooh, Parag was gone at the non-striker's end had there been a direct-hit"
8877,"FOUR, yup, getting cheeky isn't a bad way of breaking the shackles. Pandya gets a touch predictable with one good length too many, and Parag shuffles quickly, realizes fine leg is inside the circle and scoops it away over him"
8878,"FOUR, more leg-lined, but Parag's quick to make room this time, and his outside edge is thick and hard enough in the wafty drive to run away through the empty slip"
8879,"SIX, ah, the pump. Chahar drags his length back, and Parag makes it worse with his own rock inside. And then adjusts to the scoot in this as well as he crouches, heaves, a long way over cow corner"
8880,"1 run, knocked out to mid-on, where Chahar is quick to run across, swoop low, gather and then fire it back at the non-striker's as well. A direct hit would've ruined all of batsman's hard work"
8881,"1 run, high wide full toss, carved away through sweeper"
8882,"FOUR, so now some feet as well. This kid's putting up a show here, stepping away from the line, getting under the good length to go inside-out over extra cover"
8883,"FOUR, wow. So damn neat. A very tight cramping back of a length stuff, which batsman waits, and waits on, lets it get really close to him before opening up his bat face and guiding it perfectly behind point, and toying around with the angle for third man to cut off either"
8884,"2 runs, 144kph, full, just outside off. batsman tries driving through the line, through extra cover, but will settle for the inside edge running down to mid-wicket. Comeback. Captaincy. Fifty"
8885,"out Riyan Parag Run Out!! 1 run completed. Rocket armer Cutting. batsman actually does decently to chip it softly through mid-wicket, and calls for the second immediately. But Cutting's quick to get to it and fire it back really flat and one-bounced to Pandya, waiting right next to the stumps. Well, well, well, Parag ain't becoming the youngest ever IPL 50-ian. But leave that, have the favourites turned? Riyan Parag run out (Cutting/bowler) 43(29) [4s-5 6s-1]"
8886,"FOUR, the horrors of a short-wide combo. batsman arches back, throws his hands out and smashes a cut wide of backward point's left reach"
8887,"out Lbw!! Duck. Duck. And Ashton batsman's Indian journey after the miracle at Mohali has been a real disaster. bowler - meanwhile - is doing what he does best, fire it in quick, dead straight on the stumps. batsman doesn't help his cause either, shuffling a little too much and then getting beaten for pace as well as he tries to tuck it away. The mother of plumb. batsman lbw b bowler 0(1)"
8888,"FOUR, aand it doesn't EVER mater where your fielders are when the ball is a very friendly full toss drifting down leg. batsman tries to sweep, getting a tickle somewhere off something to run away really fine .. and we thought 160 was too many!"
8889,"FOUR, 15 runs of Krunal's first over! Rajasthan couldn't have asked for a better start. Another floated delivery around off, that doesn't spin much. batsman moves to an extent and creams it through the gap at covers yet again. Three boundaries in the over and the Royals are off to a flier"
8890,"leg byes, 1 run, Mumbai Indians review against batsman! Rohit took his time, had a discussion with his team mates and signals for the review with just a second to go. Looks a bad call though. batsman was way outside his crease when the ball struck him and the replays confirm the ball to be missing the stumps by a fair margin. He was trying to flick across the line but got beaten as the ball struck him on the pads. Impact was umpire's call and it was going over the stumps"
8891,"byes, FOUR, de Kock apologizes as he makes a mess of it. Should have been stopped by him, but instead it's four byes. The boundaries are leaking and Royals wouldn't mind it. batsman was looking to guide the slower delivery through third man but got beaten due to the lack of pace. The keeper couldn't gather it cleanly as he parried it away to the fence in the process"
8892,"FOUR, welcome into the attack Mr. Chahar! A short legbreak with width on offer, batsman eyes lit up on seeing that and he chops it through the gap at point and short third man, sublime"
8893,"FOUR, the leg spinner has been put under pressure right away! batsman goes down on his knee and sweeps the tossed up delivery over square leg, four more"
8894,out Caught by Suryakumar Yadav!! Chahar comes into the attack and gets the breakthrough straightaway. Got three crucial wickets in the previous match too. Invites the batsman by tossing this one outside off and batsman falls for it. Chips it towards cover where Suryakumar takes a catch diving forward. batsman c Suryakumar Yadav b bowler 12(12) [4s-2]
8895,"FOUR, has been an exhibition of finesse by batsman so far... It's not about power always. A floated delivery down the leg side and it's been lapped down to the fine leg boundary by Sanju. He's moved on to 26 off 11 balls"
8896,"FOUR, lashes the cut between backward point and short third man. Short and wide from bowler, and this time it was a normal pace delivery. batsman used that pace and carved it away"
8897,"FOUR, short of length outside off, punched through backward point. With this field - no protection deep on the off-side - there's no room to offer any width which bowler has done a couple of times already"
8898,"SIX, this is glorious from batsman. He wasn't to the pitch of this leg-break, but the timing is still so beautiful that it's gone all the way over wide long-on. The form seems to have come back along with the captaincy"
8899,"SIX, incredible batting from the Royals. They're bossing this so far. Lavish off-drive from batsman, and his flourish has taken it all the way over wide long-off. bowler disappears for 15 in his first over"
8900,"out Caught by Pollard!! Advances down looking to go all the way, but Chahar hasn't allowed him to get to the pitch. As a result, there's some room for the ball to turn, which is enough to take the outside half of the bat. Goes straight up and team couldn't have asked for anyone better than Pollard to get underneath. Desperately needed this wicket, the visitors. batsman c Pollard b bowler 35(19) [4s-6 6s-1]"
8901,"out Bowled!! Chops it back on! Poor from batsman. Hardly has had his eye in, and tries to cut a leg-break from off stump. Gets inevitably cramped for room. Mumbai have more than an opening now, especially given Royals' track-record this season. batsman b bowler 0(2)"
8902,"FOUR, short ball outside off, batsman capitalizes. He drags the pull in the gap between long-on and deep midwicket to ease the pressure"
8903,"FOUR, short again from bowler, and Parag doesn't need to get his eye in to dispatch it. He rocks back and thwacks it wide of deep midwicket. Not the follow-up team needed after that Chahar over"
8904,"FOUR, sits up nicely in the slot. Shaw continues with his really high backlift, lofting a whack straight down the ground"
8905,"FOUR, 124.3kph, massive slip down leg. And batsman couldn't have asked for it easier, going through his full-blooded pick-up-and-swipe shot behind square"
8906,"1 run, knocks this googly in front of point for a quick single. Brings up his fifty too which is greatly appreciated by his teammates as well as the home crowd"
8907,"SIX, that's a clean strike by Iyer. Skipper versus skipper and the younger one wins the contest. Takes on Ash and thumps the floated delivery right over the bowler's head, straight as an arrow and over the ropes"
8908,"FOUR, Delhi inching closer to the target! batsman is looking unstoppable, just like he was against team. Latches on to the short ball and swivel-pulls this one through backward square leg, beats the sprinter in the deep quite comfortably"
8909,out Caught by Ashwin!! That's a fantastic catch by Ashwin. Takes a well judged catch at mid-wicket running to his left. Even Gayle was circling around but it's the skipper who takes it eventually. Just as we were praising batsman for playing another gem of a knock he's thrown it away. Got outfoxed due to the slower delivery as he swung across the line and got a top-edge on his drag. He has done his job though. Should be a walk in the park for Delhi unless they face another dramatic batting collapse. batsman c Ashwin b bowler 56(41) [4s-7 6s-1]
8910,"FOUR, misfield by Gayle and that shall be the first boundary of the innings for batsman. Was a slower short ball down the leg side and batsman helped it to short fine leg where Gayle got his hands to it and parried it away to the fine leg fence"
8911,"FOUR, Curran looks disappointed as Iyer ends the over with a boundary. Makes room for himself and slices the length delivery over short third man. There were two fielders stationed there but both were inside the circle. Toying with the field is Iyer at the moment. Just 36 needed off 5 overs"
8912,out Caught by Sam Curran!! batsman throws his wicket as he tries a fancy shot. Goes down on his knee to pick the length delivery over deep square leg but ends up getting a top-edge. Curran settles himself under it and pouches it safely. Hopefully the batsmen to follow next bat sensibly. There was no need for batsman to try out anything like this. batsman c Sam Curran b bowler 6(7) [4s-1]
8913,"FOUR, safe shot by batsman as he eyes the vacant deep mid-wicket boundary. A short ball around off, the southpaw stands tall and slogs it over mid-wicket. One bounce and over the fence for as batsman gets his first boundary"
8914,"FOUR, that's an excellent shot by batsman. Was a yorker outside off and the South African squeezes it past the man at short third man. Gayle had no chance to even react as the ball raced past him and rushed into the fence"
8915,"FOUR, batsman is finding the gaps in the field like a boss. A short ball at the hips and it's been dragged through deep square leg by the southpaw, second boundary of the over. He hasn't taken any risks either"
8916,"FOUR, another cracking shot to end the over. Backs away, makes room and crunches the overpitched delivery through cover-point for his third boundary of the over. The required run is down to 5 now"
8917,"1 run, skipper leading from the front, brings up his 12th fifty in IPL. Gets a standing ovation from his team mates in the dug-out. Has been a responsible knock by the lad. Hooks the short ball to deep mid-wicket and gets to the milestone. Gets there and raises his bat to acknowledge the crowd"
8918,out Bowled!! Sweet sound of timber! batsman walks down the wicket to play this but bowler slips in yorker and nails it to perfection. The batsman couldn't do nothing there as the middle stump was uprooted. Is there a twist in the tale? Surely not! batsman b bowler 19(9) [4s-4]
8919,"out batsman Run Out!! 1 run completed. This match is turning out to be a humdinger. Second wicket in as many balls. batsman plays this one with soft hands towards deep square leg and called for two. While charging back for the second bowler somewhat got in his way and hence the batsman couldn't really take off. Mayank fires in a throw at the striker's end and Patel is nowhere in the frame. Drama! Delhi don't like easy wins, is it? batsman run out (Agarwal/Rahul) 1(1)"
8920,"FOUR, batsman hits the winning runs - it's a boundary! Sixth win of the season for the Delhi Capitals as their captain sends this one away to the deep mid-wicket fence with a fantastic pull shot. Nerves of steel by the young skipper towards the closing stages. team beat team by 5 wickets"
8921,"SIX, desperate ducking-hook. Damn fiery bouncer into the head, which Shaw in his attempt to get away from swings his bat mid-way, and surprise, surprise, connects really cleanly, flat and deep over fine leg"
8922,"FOUR, and batsman and his cover drives. bowler floates it full, gives out width as well. Sliced, powerfully, and over extra cover's leap from within the circle"
8923,"out Prithvi Shaw Run Out!! Confusion^confusion. Shikhar calls, runs half way down, but is ball-watching all through as he does. Shaw responds, only to be sent back. And hence when both of them are stuck half way down the pitch, Mandeep nails the direct hit. How did it get to Mandeep? Well, it was a msicued chip to cover. Prithvi Shaw run out (Mandeep) 13(11) [4s-1 6s-1]"
8924,"FOUR, lucky edge. batsman charges down to open up a cut over the off-side, but the bounce gets big on him, and the outside splice is good enough to fly over the slip cordon"
8925,"FOUR, nothing lucky here, it's a proper crunch. bowler goes shorter, but ends up dishing out a half tracker, which batsman can upper-cut now, and there being no third man helps his cause as well"
8926,"SIX, batsman attacks the debutant off his very first ball. Dances down and launches him back over the long-off boundary"
8927,"FOUR, that's superbly played. Waits on the ball and back-cuts it through backward point"
8928,"FOUR, back of a length, spinning away from off, Iyer steps back and punches it through the covers"
8929,"FOUR, short ball at the stumps, real stinker to start his spell. batsman rocks back and smashes the pull through midwicket"
8930,"1 run, pulled away to deep midwicket"
8931,"FOUR, no slip in place and this outside edge has run away for four. Grip and turn with the carrom ball for bowler, enough to find Iyer's outside edge and also enough to keep rolling into the ropes"
8932,"FOUR, he's fetched this googly from outside leg stump and reverse-swept it through backward point. Incredible shot"
8933,"SIX, massive, that's one way to greet the leg-spinner, batsman backed away, lost his bottom hand but still has enough power to send the swipe high and over long-off for a maximum"
8934,"FOUR, it's all one-handed from KL and he's getting the runs as well, flighted delivery outside off, he bent down low, used the bottom hand and then swept it over square leg for a boundary"
8935,"out Stumped!! Appeal for a stumping and Pant looks confident. He's on the line and that means KL is OUT. That's some comeback from bowler, a beaut of a leg-break, drifted in from outside off, dragged batsman forward and then spun past his outside edge. batsman was lunging forward in defence, dragged his right-foot out and Pant is quick enough to whip the bails - even as batsman's feet stayed static on the line. Good bargain for bowler, 10 runs and a big wicket so far. batsman st Pant b bowler 12(9) [4s-1 6s-1]"
8936,"SIX, going, going and gone. No respite for bowler today. Flighted just outside off, batsman bends his back knee and slog sweeps it high into the night sky. These Kotla boundaries are not big enough for the Jamaican, for that matter which ground is"
8937,"out Caught by Axar!! Stunning work! This is the perfect definition of team work by Ingram and Axar. bowler has traveled a lot but will be relieved to see the back of batsman. The wrong 'un which is fraction short, batsman does not get enough power behind the pull shot, skies it to deep mid-wicket where Ingram is waiting, he takes it right on the edge of the boundary cushion and since the momentum was taking him over, he threw the ball all the way to Axar near long-on. The back hand flick was just perfect as Axar didn't have to move much. Huge moment in the game. batsman c Axar b bowler 69(37) [4s-6 6s-5]"
8938,"out Caught&Bowled!! Second wicket in the over. What a day bowler is having. Belted by KL, picked his wicket. Smashed around the park by Gayle, sent him back as well and now picks another. The googly which sticks in the surface a tad more than Curran expected, he is early into the back foot push and lobs a dolly back to bowler. He flings it up and pumps his fist. Boy isn't he delighted. batsman c and b bowler 0(4)"
8939,"FOUR, lovely shot! Dropped short and batsman is quick to latch onto it, transfered his weight back and pulled it over the mid-wicket fielder, placement was perfect from the skipper"
8940,"1 run, dropped! Rabada apologises. Half tracker and batsman could have hit it anywhere, instead he swivels and pulls it to deep backward square, Rabada misjudged it badly and tracked back before running in, dived forward and got his hands to it. But the ball did not stick. That would have been an impressive end to bowler's spell"
8941,"FOUR, horrible bowling and that is putting it mildly. Rank long hop outside off and this time batsman does not miss out, he waits and holds his shape to slap it over extra cover, one bounce and over the ropes"
8942,"out Stumped!! Some really smart bowling. batsman gives away his cards early, running down the pitch even before bowler gets into his delivery stride - allowing him all the time to fire it short and well outside off. Obvious miss, sneaking under the bat and Pant's gloves almost outdo Dhoni. batsman st Pant b bowler 30(27) [4s-1 6s-1]"
8943,"FOUR, well, well. Smashes his first IPL runs -- getting a juicy short-wide one to crash into, slapping it through extra cover"
8944,"FOUR, lots of clubbing in this. A 117.1kph slower cutter tried, digging it short, which batsman goes right behind to in mowing it very agriculturally into cow corner"
8945,"FOUR, 139.8kph, corrects his overdose of wides with a shorter, but wide one nevertheless. Brar carves, uppishly, over extra cover"
8946,"out Caught by Shreyas Iyer!! Skiddy 143.4kph bumper into the ribs. batsman had to go after everything, obviously it is the 20th over, and he tries a tennis-like-pull on this one. But can only mistime it to long-on, where Iyer, after misjudging, does well to dive in front to pluck it cleanly enough. batsman c Shreyas Iyer b bowler 16(14) [4s-2]"
8947,"FOUR, neatly done, bowler took some pace off the ball and angled it across the left-hander, batsman waited on it, played it with an open face and ran it past short third man"
8948,"SIX, massive, that's the batsman we know in the IPL - that's out of the ground, the knuckle ball from bowler, on a length and just outside off, batsman cleared his right leg and heaved it high and over long-on, 101m on that shot"
8949,"SIX, top stuff. And to imagine this guy hasn't played a FC match yet .. he anticipates the quick bouncer, is quicker to pull it off his shoulder, smoking it so damn cleanly over deep square leg. Punjab > 160"
8950,"FOUR, they're looking to attack bowler, too short and too straight from the leg-spinner, batsman rocks back and pulls it behind square on the on-side for a boundary"
8951,"FOUR, belted, bowler got a hand onto it, but such was the fierceness of the shot - he could only get a hand onto it - tossed up on middle, batsman pressed forward and drilled it back at the bowler, will go down as a half-chance"
8952,"FOUR, too full and sliding down leg, batsman bends half-way down and sweeps it fine - Ishant, at short fine dived over the ball and lets another boundary through"
8953,"FOUR, 16 from the over, bowler dropped this one short and well outside off, batsman rocked back and punched it hard - into the gap wide of cover-point, no need to run for those"
8954,"out Caught by Rutherford!! This was always coming! Four dot balls and Mayank throws his wicket away, came down the track way too early - bowler saw it and went short, good pace and good bounce - cramped for room, Mayank's attempted cross-batted swat went nowhere, straight up in the air and towards cover-point. The debutant Rutherford was under the ball, watched it like a hawk and completes the catch. batsman c Rutherford b bowler 2(9)"
8955,"FOUR, streaky and four, on a good length and from round the wicket, batsman was late in getting his bat down, squirted off the inside edge and past short fine, runs away to the ropes in a hurry"
8956,"FOUR, cracking shot, short of a length and well outside off, the slower ball from bowler, punched off the back-foot and to the right of Shaw at cover-point"
8957,"SIX, a rank long-hop and batsman has sent it soaring over long-on. bowler tries something funky, bowls a flat off-break on off, batsman rocks back and pummels it high and over long-on for a maximum"
8958,"out Caught by Prithvi Shaw!! One shot too many and team batsmen are throwing away their wickets - trying to match Gayle's power. Not a smart shot from batsman, ran down the track, got himself too close to the ball, went through with the lofted on-drive, plenty of height but not the distance. Shaw settled underneath the skier at deep mid-wicket and holds on. What are team trying to achieve? This isn't a 200 wicket for sure. batsman c Prithvi Shaw b bowler 7(5) [4s-1]"
8959,"SIX, two gifts from bowler and both have disappeared. Full toss just below the waist, batsman says thank you very much and launches it into the stands near deep mid-wicket"
8960,"1 run, fifty for batsman. He shows the sticker on his bat that says - Universe Boss. Job not done as Punjab need to bat deep and take them to a competitive total. Wrong 'un around leg-stump and batsman sweeps it to deep backward square"
8961,"SIX, another rubbish delivery from bowler. Googly that is pitched halfway down, batsman had ample time to pick his spot and it is cow corner, rocked back and pulled it all the way for a maximum"
8962,"SIX, wow! That is a top shot from batsman. Flighted outside off, batsman bends low and gets under the ball, chips it with the spin over extra cover and the timing is such that it clears the rope"
8963,"FOUR, that is not the place to bowl to Lynn or for that matter any batsman. Short and outside off, Lynn had the width and he slaps it hard through the packed off-side field. No need to run for that"
8964,"FOUR, help yourself delivery and batsman does just that. In an attempt to go short, Bhuvi slips one on the hips, batsman with one leg up in the air pulls it past the man at short fine. Good start for team, 10 off the first over"
8965,"FOUR, poor start from bowler. Half tracker and Lynn does not miss out, he plays the back foot punch past extra cover and the timing takes care of the rest. He relied on timing rather than power"
8966,"SIX, another gift from bowler. Long hop and batsman had all the time to pick his spot, he rocks back and muscles the pull over deep square leg, just managed to clear the rope"
8967,"FOUR, much needed boundary for team! Lynn latches on to the short ball and swivel-pulls it into the gap at deep mid-wicket. The ball drops just in front of the boundary cushions, such sweet was the timing"
8968,"SIX, dropped and parried over the fence! Nadeem even before taking the catch was looking whether he was about to the touch the boundary. Lucky escape for the left hander batsman. A short ball that was pulled away to deep mid-wicket by him and as a result of Rinku's mess, he not only gets a life but also a six"
8969,"FOUR, Rinku finally connects one. A wide delivery that was angled across the left hander who punches it past the fielder at cover. The fielder in the deep was way too square in order to cut this down"
8970,"SIX, batsman brings up the 50-run stand with a maximum. Gets a low full and the southpaw makes sure to thump it over the long-on fence for a powerful six. The ball's lost in the crowd as the fourth umpire runs in with a box of used Kookaburras"
8971,out Caught by Rashid Khan!! batsman departs after a handy knock! Time for Dre Russ to walk in next. Was a short ball around middle and leg and Rinku pulled it straight to deep mid-wicket. The Afghan leggie charges to his left and takes a fine sliding catch to bring an end to Singh's stay at the crease. batsman c Rashid Khan b bowler 30(25) [4s-1 6s-2]
8972,"FOUR, another miscue but it won't matter. Lynn brings up his 9th fifty in IPL. Another slower cutter slanting away from the right-hander, Lynn throws the kitchen sink and gets a thick outside edge which flies over backward point and into the square third man fence"
8973,out Caught by Williamson!! Lynn runs out of patience. Frustrated with a flurry of mistimed strokes he decides to smash this over cover and could only chip it inside the ring. Williamson runs to his left from cover and times his slide to perfection to claim a fine catch. batsman c Williamson b bowler 51(47) [4s-4 6s-1]
8974,"SIX, misses the yorker and bowls a juicy low full toss on the pads, Russell whips it over the square leg fence with an air of nonchalance. Creamedddddd"
8975,"SIX, slower ball bumper but Russell picked the bones out of it. Sets himself deep inside the crease and powers the pull way over the leaping fielder at deep square"
8976,"out Caught by Rashid Khan!! Oh, the Dre Russ fireworks has been cut short. It's the best Sunrisers bowling combo that does the trick. Bhuvi looks to pin the yorker but feeds a low full toss on the pads instead, Russell batters it off the cue end and he didn't get as much of an elevation as he would have liked. Straight down the throat of Rashid at deep mid-wicket. batsman c Rashid Khan b bowler 15(9) [6s-2]"
8977,"FOUR, picks the legbreak, jumps back inside the crease and clobbers the pull over square leg. In the gap and that's a boundary"
8978,"out Caught by Bairstow!! batsman has done all sorts of Bollywood moves whilst at the crease. It's very hard to hit bowler with such constant shuffly movements. So, Piyush batsman tries to reverse swat bowler over short third but all he could manage was a fine tickle on the glove. Sharp reflexes from YJB. batsman c Bairstow b bowler 4(8) [4s-1]"
8979,"SIX, stands solid inside the crease and pumps this quicker delivery into the long-on stands. Timed!!"
8980,"SIX, ""catch, catch"" shouted Bairstow but it is just over a leaping Shankar. bowler gives it air and Lynn is not holding back, lofts through the line and it was a mishit, stayed up for a long time before evading long-on. 28 off 2 overs and team are off to a flier"
8981,"SIX, this is rubbish bowling. Short and outside off, batsman stands upright and slaps it flat over extra cover, got enough power behind that to clear the boundary rope"
8982,"FOUR, need to get the short delivery higher, batsman is waiting for these, clears his front leg and pulls it over mid-wicket, once more just managed to clear the fielder on the edge of the circle"
8983,"FOUR, batsman is already winning the mental battle. Khaleel goes for the yorker and misses it, the low full toss outside off and batsman spoons it over the off-side field, the fast outfield does the rest"
8984,"out Bowled!! Cleaned up! But team will reckon he has done his job. Khaleel is pumped. He tried the short ball - didn't work. Tried the yorker - didn't work. What was left? The slower ball - worked. The off-cutter and it holds up on the surface, batsman is through his heave early and the ball arrives later to uproot the leg-stump. batsman b bowler 25(8) [4s-3 6s-2]"
8985,"out Caught by Shankar!! Another slower delivery. Another wicket. Khaleel might go for runs but he's a wicket-taker. Angled it across the right hander, Gill wanted to drive but was into the shot early, sliced it towards backward point where Shankar takes a good catch. team pulling things back after that quick start. batsman c Shankar b bowler 3(4)"
8986,"FOUR, shot! Fuller and outside off, Rana leans forward and creams the drive past cover-point, Nadeem ran behind the ball and only managed to escort it to the fence. The dive never came"
8987,"out Caught by Bairstow!! Brought back and Bhuvi strikes first ball. It is the in-form Rana who has to depart. Short of length and bit of extra lift in the corridor around off-stump, Rana tries to steer to third man but is undone by the bounce, the outside edge carries at a nice height for Bairstow. batsman c Bairstow b bowler 11(11) [4s-1]"
8988,"1 run, direct hit and batsman was gone. Hesitation between the two batsmen and it was the team skipper who was in trouble. He tried to force the good length delivery through the off-side and mishit it towards point, started to go for the single before stopping, Lynn kept going and that left batsman with no choice. He put in a desparate dive but Shankar's throw was not on target"
8989,"FOUR, cheeky! That is what you get with batsman. On a length and outside off, batsman opens the bat face at the last second and runs it fine, beating third man in the deep comfortably"
8990,"out batsman Run Out!! 1 run completed. team have lost four wickets and Rashid Khan is yet to bowl. 4 overs of him remaining. This was a suicidal second by DK and he's livid with himself. Had flicked the flatter delivery to deep mid-wicket and two was the call straightaway. He decides to take on one of the best fielders in team's team though. Shankar charges in towards the ball, gathers it neatly and gets rid of the ball in the blink of an eye. Bairstow collects the ball and takes down the bails and DK's dive ain't enough as he's well short of the crease. batsman run out (Shankar/Bairstow) 6(4) [4s-1]"
8991,"SIX, 135ks doesn't matter this time! bowler missed his length and bowled it slightly short outside off, batsman pounces on it as he sends it soaring into the long-on stands with a well-timed loft"
8992,"FOUR, Cariappa has denied bowler his maiden wicket in IPL. Short and wide outside off, batsman frees his arms and slashes hard, it goes flat and straight into the hands of KC Cariappa at deep point who lets it slips through his fingers and to make matters worse, it has gone over the boundary ropes"
8993,"3 runs, and another drop! Slog sweep attempted, and was a fot top-edge for the man at deep backward to drop it. He never even got close to it. Such a poor effort from Gurney. team are on a free fall"
8994,"FOUR, slapped down the ground! That is a four..waited on it and slammed it over the bowler's head"
8995,"SIX, goes big again! That's outta here as well. Flighted ball, batsman decided to free his arms and pump it over long-on for a sixer. team want an early finish"
8996,"1 run, Chawla at deep square drops one now. Oh team! This is shambolic. Young bowler has another drop off his bowling. Not his day. Short ball, batsman goes for the pull, gets a top-edge and the ball stayed in the air for an eternity. Chawla though never got anywhere close"
8997,"out Bowled!! And bowler exults. He has got his first IPL wicket and that is batsman. He would want to cherish this amidst the gloom surrounding team. The team camp can hardly celebrate. Slower delivery at the sticks, batsman was through with his slog a little too early and the wickets were disturbed. batsman b bowler 67(38) [4s-3 6s-5]"
8998,"FOUR, gets his bat down on a shortish ball at the last moment and places it well past the man at short third fielder for a four"
8999,"SIX, he doesn't want to hang around for too long..loopy ball, batsman sits down and slog sweeps it over deep square leg for a sixer. Only a shot away"
9000,"SIX, keep calm team and accept the Murphy's law! They have been annihilated here. Loopy ball and has been banged over deep mid with the help of a slog sweep. batsman, like he did against team, finishes off with a sixer"
9001,"FOUR, short ball on the stumps, batsman swivels and powers the pull in the gap through mid-wicket, no need to run for those"
9002,"FOUR, sets himself up for a slower delivery and clobbers the off-cutter over the fielder at extra cover, excellent timing and placement from batsman"
9003,"FOUR, slightly full outside off, batsman gets down on one knee and slogsweeps it over mid-wicket. Easy!"
9004,"SIX, and the new bat brings the result straightaway. Picks out the googly, sits on one knee and smokes it into the second tier over the long-on fence. Can't be that full to batsman"
9005,"SIX, bashes this short ball into the crowd. Picked the length up so quickly. Leapt back in the crease and pummelled it"
9006,"SIX, disappears into the crowd. Slanted in on leg from round the wicket, batsman lowers himself to get under the ball and swings it backward of square"
9007,"FOUR, similar ball into the pads, this time he just helps it away through the gap between short fine and backward square"
9008,"SIX, tearing into bowler here. 20 off the over already and there's still a ball left. He had gone full at the stumps with this delivery, right in the slot for batsman loft it down the ground for six"
9009,"FOUR, short of length at the hip, such a loosener at 126kph, and batsman punishes it with a thumping pull to the long leg boundary"
9010,"FOUR, drifting down leg, so batsman doesn't have to worry about the leg-before. He goes down on the back knee and sweeps hard, sending it fine of short fine leg"
9011,"SIX, smoked into the second tier. No respite for bowler. After an expensive first over, here he is hoping to quietly start a new spell. But batsman catches him at the door. Swipes him away over midwicket"
9012,"FOUR, spinning away outside off, had been pushed through the air much quicker. batsman sits back in the crease, anticipating it, and dabs it cunningly past the keeper"
9013,"1 run, length ball outside off, slapped to deep point. It's the fourth 100-run stand that these two have put up this season. Incredible!"
9014,"2 runs, pushes this off-break gently in front of long-off and hurtles the second run. Fifty for batsman. Keeps going from strength to strength"
9015,"1 run, batsman's turn. More cheers from the crowd. This is a celebration going on, not a run chase. Clipped off the pads backward of square. For all their brutality otherwise, they've brought up fifties with innocent singles"
9016,"FOUR, drops the length short and allows batsman to stand back and pull it away to deep square leg. Pivoted on his back leg to power the ball away"
9017,"out Caught by Stoinis!! The away swinger does it. Spills the ball outside off and batsman looks to drive and edges it to the man at first slip. That flew off the blade and was taken by the slip fielder who sat under it and took it over his head. Nice carry off the wicket as the batter threw his hands at it. team have lost Watto early, again. batsman c Stoinis b bowler 5(3) [4s-1]"
9018,"out Bowled!! Whatta delivery! Between the legs and the bat to rattle the sticks. bowler guns down batsman here. Back-to-back wickets for team and bowler. Inch-perfect yorker with the new nut. Chinnaswamy erupts as well. team fans have found their voices again. Game on! bowler, what an inspiration. batsman b bowler 0(1)"
9019,"SIX, batsman has arrived! Remember his knock here last year? Jumps out of his crease, shows no signs of nerves and launches bowler over deep extra cover with a power-packed smack on the shuffle"
9020,"SIX, short of length delivery just outside off, this time batsman stayed put in his crease and heaved the pull wide of long-on. Just clears the boundary"
9021,"1 run, length ball on middle and leg, nudged quietly through midwicket"
9022,"FOUR, steps out, makes some room and slaps this short ball over mid-off. In this partnership, he might now start to be the aggressor to keep the rate in control"
9023,"out Bowled!! bowler has broken through. Just what team needed of him. It's the drift that gets batsman here. Curves in nicely towards leg-stump, slips past the inside edge into the front pad, before ricocheting onto the stumps. Brilliant from bowler. batsman b bowler 29(29) [4s-2 6s-1]"
9024,"SIX, sees some loop on the delivery, and puts his dancing shoes on in a flash. That's superb batting. He got right to the pitch before launching it straight back for six. 13 off bowler's final over. It's set up superbly for the final four"
9025,"out Jadeja Run Out!! Both batsmen are at the striker's end, and Saini calmly picks the ball up and runs at his end for the run out. He had rushed batsman for pace with this short ball, inducing a mistimed pull shot beside the pitch. batsman initially came down for a single, which set Jadeja on his way, but then turned his back on him. There was no turning back for Jadeja from there. Jadeja run out (bowler) 11(12)"
9026,"FOUR, flies off the outside edge past short third man, no chance for the fielder who was inside the ring. He just threw his hands at the slightest amount of width that Saini had provided"
9027,"SIX, back of a length delivery just outside off, batsman simply clears the front leg and belts it over wide long-on to bring up his half-century. He just knows how to turn on in these run-chases"
9028,"no ball, SIX, oh this is just awful from Saini, not only with the delivery he's bowled, but also that he's overstepped. With third man inside the ring, he bangs it in short outside off. batsman happily throws his hands at it and whirls it into the crowd"
9029,"out Caught by Parthiv Patel!! Short of length on off, Bravo swings wildly but only manages a top-edge through to the keeper. There's a check on the no-ball but Saini is fine, just. batsman c Parthiv Patel b bowler 5(4)"
9030,"FOUR, he goes short first ball and batsman dispatches him through square leg. Oh those nerves, watch those nerves team"
9031,"SIX, oh my! This is gigantic. It's gone on the roof. Short of length, another really nothing ball that batsman absolutely destroys. It's a 111-metre six"
9032,"SIX, six more. Umesh Yadav crumbling. Tries a yorker but misses it at least by a couple of feet and batsman lofts it with enough power - if not timing - to clear long-off"
9033,"SIX, stunning scenes! A full toss is fiercely swiped over the deep midwicket boundary. An absolute skimmer from MS batsman who is on the verge of doing the unthinkable at the Chinnaswamy again. team in shock"
9034,"1 run, slower delivery and was ill-timed to mid-off. Faf wanted a single and set off. ABD had to get the direct hit in but didn't take his time to throw the sticks down. Faf was gone for all money"
9035,"out SN Thakur Run Out!! What drama! What unbearable drama. But team, who almost looked like having a meltdown in the final over, have been bailed out by a direct-hit from Parthiv Patel. Very brave from Umesh initially to go for the slower off-cutter. And his execution is spot on, as it sneaks through batsman's attempted cut. They have to run, and Parthiv is alert to it. With the ball bouncing just in front of him, the gather couldn't have been easy, but he makes no mistake and his throw at the stumps is on target too, finding Thakur just short. SN Thakur run out (Parthiv Patel) 0(0)"
9036,"leg byes, FOUR, terrible delivery! That's Umesh for you. Two ends of the spectrum can be seen. Was well down leg and clipped the pads off the attempted heave to run away to the fine leg fence"
9037,"out Caught by de Villiers!! Short ball, gets big on the batter and batsman looking to pull, gets a top-edge for ABD to take it. Almost collided with Nath trying to take it. But completes the catch without any fuss. team are three down now and in deep trouble. Once again are three down inside the powerplay. team have turned this game around on its head. batsman c de Villiers b bowler 5(15)"
9038,"no run, inswinger on a length around leg-stump, Jadhav looks to get some tickle on that but fails to make any contact off the bat. It brushes the thigh pad and flies to PP to his left, Kohli checked with his bowler and keeper and then went up for the review"
9039,"FOUR, luck's written all over that delivery. A peach of an inswinger from bowler, bowled at 139ks and nearly cut Jadhav into half. Was caught poking around the fifth stump channel and the inside edge flies wide of PP to his left"
9040,"FOUR, just a flick of the wrists, nothing less nothing more! Sees the ball angle into his pads and unveiled those whippy wrists on the flick did batsman, all the way through mid-wicket..."
9041,"out Caught by de Villiers!! team pacers are on fire and we haven't said that very often in the history of IPL. Ah, this is some night for the team fans. Umesh kept rattling the batsmen with pace and something had to give; Jadhav tries to go across the line and doesn't bother to move his feet while at it. It takes the thick top-edge and lands straight in the bucket hands of AB at mid-off. batsman c de Villiers b bowler 9(9) [4s-2]"
9042,"FOUR, streaky! Would have been out had there been a backward point, wasn't to be. batsman gets a full ball outside off and he fishes at it sans any feet, sliced it off the thick outside edge and it flies square past non-existent point"
9043,"FOUR, short ball outside off, batsman had some extra time to adjust as it was around the 130ks, he arches back and ramps it over non-existent short third"
9044,"FOUR, batsman's so good at playing smart cricket shots and this is one of them. Sees the ball slide down leg and paddles it in a flash past the keeper, played it late but found the middle which is what matters the most"
9045,"FOUR, short ball down the leg-side, batsman swivels and powers the pull in the gap behind square on the leg-side, no need to run for those"
9046,"FOUR, batsman is off and running. bowler gets a bit greedy. Tries to swing it from middle-stump and in the process gives batsman a freebie, flicked away uppishly over the square leg umpire"
9047,"SIX, that's a great shot by batsman. Walks down the wicket and flicks the shortish delivery against the turn, the pitch makes it easier for the ball to go the distance, clears deep mid-wicket comfortably"
9048,"SIX, pumped over deep mid-wicket! Patel reads the googly to perfection and smokes it over deep mid-wicket for half a dozen. Couldn't have played it any better"
9049,"out Caught by du Plessis!! bowler gets rid of batsman. He shimmies down the wicket and lofts the delivery high up in the air. The ball went miles up in the air but it could travel as far as deep mid-off. du Plessis charges in from the deep, settles underneath the skier and takes it safely. batsman c du Plessis b bowler 24(20) [4s-1 6s-1]"
9050,"FOUR, Patel ends the over with a boundary and moves closer to his fifty. Gets a full toss and the southpaw makes sure to chip it over the infield at covers. No fielders in the deep and that's an easy four"
9051,"SIX, that's a huge six! Slightly short ball and batsman treks back to smoke it over deep mid-wicket. Could have been a six on any ground. Just the kind of shot batsman was looking for to cut loose"
9052,"FOUR, team fans give Parthiv a standing ovation as the opener gets to his fifty with a boundary. Waits for the slower delivery and whips it through the gap at mid-wicket to send the ball away to the fence. Has been a crucial knock but he needs to get a move on"
9053,out Caught by Watson!! Parthiv departs after getting to his fifty. That has been the problem with him this season. Not able to carry on and get a big score. Makes room and slaps the short ball straight to Watson at who was stationed close to the ring at covers. Time for Moeen to walk in next. batsman c Watson b bowler 53(37) [4s-2 6s-4]
9054,"out Caught by (sub)Shorey!! Catch of the season? Faf has done something remarkable here. Heaved down the ground, Faf held his balance at the fence and scooped it up for the man at long-on - Shorey - who was closeby to take it. Credit to Shorey as well not to distract Faf and also linger closeby in case something like this happened. Superb presence of mind to throw the ball away in the nick of the time. batsman c (sub)Shorey b bowler 14(13) [6s-1]"
9055,"FOUR, tickled away fine as that was the quicker ball. Has run away to the fence for a four"
9056,"FOUR, bangs the ball short and has been pulled away! There was no one at deep mid and it was a four"
9057,"FOUR, right up there! Brilliant delivery and equally well played. Opened the face of the blade and dug it out to squeeze the ball past the dive of the man at short third for a four. team need more of these"
9058,"out Caught by Rayudu!! Scoops up a length ball which bounced a touch higher and the man at point takes it. That got big on him, batsman could not keep it down and the man at point took an easy catch. team have been poor at the death. batsman c Rayudu b bowler 5(6)"
9059,"FOUR, with the point and cover point in, the fuller ball was a bad idea. batsman got his bat down and slammed it over point for a four. The wrists of steel came into play"
9060,"no run, that was full, wide, batsman threw his bat it and misses. There was a noise, MS went for the DRS but there was nothing on the UltraEdge. Mo continues.."
9061,"FOUR, steered! Four! past short third man that one. Fuller and wider one, batsman maintained his balance to squeeze it past short third"
9062,out Caught by SN Thakur!! Looks to launch the slower ball and holes out at long-off. That was touch slower off the deck and batsman wanted to muscle it down the ground only to find the man in the deep. Thakur after it taking does a gig. team continue their good work at the death. batsman c SN Thakur b bowler 26(16) [4s-5]
9063,"FOUR, streaky! Not where he intended but he won't mind it. Runs down the wicket and swings through the line, the outswinger takes the outside edge and flies over short third man"
9064,"out Caught by Dhoni!! Gone! bowler has the big wicket and he's unstoppable. He goes off on a run like Tahir. Perfect start for team. team's lynchpin is sent back early. Good length ball outside off, batsman drives without accounting for the swing and the outside edge is found, Dhoni dives to his right and takes it safely. That is the area to bowl to batsman in whatever format - on a good length and outside off. batsman c Dhoni b bowler 9(8) [4s-2]"
9065,"FOUR, AB is away. They need a move on and who better than batsman to rely on. Not a bad delivery by any means. Back of a length delivery and batsman thumps it over mid-on, one bounce and over the ropes"
9066,"SIX, good end to the over. Parthiv hits the first six of the game. He waits for that short of length delivery and picks it off with a well timed pull shot, sails into the crowd near backward square leg"
9067,"SIX, this time it comes off. bowler was a bit straight in his line and that allowed batsman to make contact, sets up a firm base and heaves it over deep square leg. That should make him feel good"
9068,"1 run, oh! Faf almost pulls off a stunner. This would have been the catch of the tournament. batsman struck the off-drive uppishly towards mid-off, Faf times his jump perfectly and goes with one hand, it doesn't stick"
9069,"SIX, Parthiv is peppering that backward square crowd. Another good length ball right in his arc, he maintains a low base and heaves it with a clean bat swing over the rope"
9070,"FOUR, Thakur has lost his line in the last 10 balls or so. Strays on the pads and that is easy pickings, batsman flicks it in front of square and Tahir's dive was nowhere close to the ball"
9071,"FOUR, 16 runs to end the powerplay. Thakur tries to follow the backing away batsman with a full delivery, but ends up bowling it in the slot, pumped right back over and the ball bounces just inside the fence"
9072,"SIX, plenty of hang time but Parthiv gets the desired distance as well. He goes down on his knee and slog sweeps it over deep mid-wicket, managed to clear the rope comfortably in the end"
9073,"out Caught by du Plessis!! batsman gone! Faf judges it perfectly. bowler gets the big wicket. team's backbone is back in the hut within 7 overs. batsman shimmies down the wicket, isn't to the pitch and the ball turns a bit as well, the cue-end skies up towards long-off and Faf is right on the edge of the boundary rope. He takes it with his fingers pointing upwards. batsman c du Plessis b bowler 25(19) [4s-3 6s-1]"
9074,"FOUR, lovely shot! Right out of the coaching manual. Nothing much wrong with the delivery. Fuller and outside off, Nath leans forward and creams the drive past mid-off. Thakur can only fetch it from the fence"
9075,"SIX, that's the kind of form he is in! Can't bowl it there. On the pads and batsman flicks it over deep square leg with utter ease. Sweet!"
9076,"FOUR, just look how quick the outfield is. This wasn't middled whatsoever but the pace makes it easier for batsman. Gets heaves across the line and gets it off the inside half of his bat, beats the fielder at short mid-wicket initially and finds the boundary thereafter"
9077,"FOUR, sliding in on leg stump, batsman picks the line early, bends his back knee and swings it backward of square"
9078,"FOUR, short ball on middle stump, batsman smacks the pull through square leg. Smith just throws his head back after another poor delivery"
9079,"FOUR, this is such a fantastic shot. He was beaten in length after stepping out, as Gopal pulled it well back. But Shaw remains undeterred, going through with the cover drive and creaming it to the fence"
9080,"SIX, clears the front leg to a googly that was right in his slot and lofts it through the line over long-on. Clean strike from batsman"
9081,"FOUR, Shaw has found the gap to perfection. There was a man at fine leg and at deep mid-wicket but batsman pulls it right between the two fielders. The timing was also good enough and it races to the fence"
9082,"SIX, high and handsome! This should get batsman going. bowler was bowling brilliant slower ones but for some reasons he went for a yorker, misses it and ends up serving it right into the slot for batsman. He clears his front leg and hoicks it over deep mid-wicket for a maximum"
9083,"2 runs, direct hit from the fielder at deep mid-wicket. But batsman is easily home. It was on a good length and was on the stumps, batsman tucks it wide of deep mid-wicket and charges back for a quick double"
9084,"FOUR, excellent from batsman, he knows Kulkarni is one of the weaker bowler in this Royals attack and he wants to target him. The pace of Kulkarni allows batsman to go down on his kness and he half-sweeps-half-whips it over fine leg for a boundary"
9085,"FOUR, batsman tumbles but batsman connects and gets a boundary. Things only batsman can do! He gets inside the line of the ball, goes down on his knees and almost paddles it over short fine for a boundary"
9086,"SIX, fifty in a canter for batsman. Wow! This guy is a gem of a player. Archer misses his yorker, it was in the slot for batsman. He clears his front leg, gets in a good position and lifts it over deep square leg for a maximum"
9087,"FOUR, fuller and on the stumps, batsman pumps it straight down the ground for a boundary. That went to the fence like a tracer bullet"
9088,"no ball, FOUR, batsman has dispatched it for a boundary. It is a No-ball too, it was a full-toss above the waist height, batsman pumps it wide of fine leg for a boundary. Free-hit!"
9089,"out Caught by Riyan Parag!! Much- needed wicket for Royals. It was a flighted delivery on a fuller length, batsman wanted to dispatch it over long-on. It spins away and due to that batsman failed to time it as well as he would have liked it. Parah at long-on came under it and takes it with utmost ease. batsman c Riyan Parag b bowler 42(39) [4s-4 6s-1]"
9090,"SIX, first six for batsman in his IPL career. I am sure it's not the last. You cannot bowl length at this stage and bowler did exactly that. It was wide of off, batsman reaches for it and clobbers it over deep mid-wicket. It comes off the bottom half of the willow but the power that he posseses takes it over the fence"
9091,"FOUR, that has raced to the fence in some micro seconds. It was in the slot for batsman, on that fuller length. He clears his leg and powers it with utter disdain, wide of deep cover for a boundary. The young man loved it too, he punches the air in delight"
9092,"out Caught by Riyan Parag!! Staright to long-off. A short little cameo from batsman! He has helped bring down the required rate but would have wanted to take his team home. It was a slower one on a back of a length, batsman wanted to lift it over long-off ends up finding it where parag makes no mistake. batsman c Riyan Parag b bowler 11(5) [4s-1 6s-1]"
9093,"SIX, batsman has dispatched it over for a maximum .Whatta hit from batsman! This has surely sealed the match for team. It was on a fuller length and was wide of off, batsman comes under it and pumps it over long-on for a maximum"
9094,"SIX, batsman has finished off the things in style. team win by 6-wickets and go top of the table. Incredible hitting from the southpaw. Hold On! Umpires are still checking whether that ball hit the rope on the full. It's a six and Delhi has sealed the victory!"
9095,"FOUR, another sublime shot by Shikhar! Puts on his dancing shoes and bludgeons the shortish delivery through mid-on. The fielder was very square, hence this was always heading to the fence"
9096,"SIX, what a superb shot by Shikhar! Trying to outplay the shots played by Rahane. Goes down on his knee and picks this one up with nonchalance to clear the fine leg fence"
9097,"FOUR, he loves to bat on these kind of tracks, doesn't he? Walks down the wicket and lifts it over the bowler's head for four more. There was a fielder at long-on but this just manages to beat his sprint"
9098,"FOUR, Gopal struggling against the left hander! batsman goes down on his knee and lifts the tossed up delivery over square leg for four runs this time around"
9099,"FOUR, some lovely wristwork from batsman. Length ball at the stumps, picks it away through midwicket with great force off the wrists"
9100,"FOUR, short of length at the body, Shaw's arms don't have the space to move freely, but he manages enough power through the swing to heave this over midwicket"
9101,"1 run, Ashton Turner is having a nightmare. After three ducks in a row, he's now put down a skier. Thick top-edge on the pull shot from Shaw, Turner went back from position at midwicket to get under it, but it bounced off his palms"
9102,"FOUR, walks across the stumps, receives a full toss and paddles it past short fine leg"
9103,"FOUR, swats the off-cutter through midwicket for four more. He's looking in ominous touch. Just sits up so beautifully on this pitch for batsman to have a biff"
9104,"1 run, driven off the back foot wide of Smith at extra cover. Good effort there with the dive, but can only make a half-stop, not enough to stop batsman from getting to his fifty. He's gone a few notches higher in these last few games"
9105,"FOUR, short ball from Parag which is almost nonchalantly dispatched through midwicket. Way too easy"
9106,"FOUR, short googly outside off, really ordinary stuff, and batsman isn't in the mood to let them get away. Smashes the pull wide of deep midwicket"
9107,"out Stumped!! Gopal's come back superbly. He's spotted batsman advance down the pitch, and so he's fired this well wide outside off to beat him. Samson completes a nice stumping. batsman st Samson b bowler 54(27) [4s-8 6s-2]"
9108,"out Caught by Stokes!! Iyer holes out at deep midwicket. Maybe the perils of good form, which gave him enough confidence to go after the bowling straightaway. But this comes right off the toe-end as he heaves it from outside off. Easy catch for Stokes. batsman c Stokes b bowler 4(5)"
9109,"FOUR, batsman at his sublime best! Not all that full but a hint of width and he trusts the surface by driving on the up. Relied on timing and placed it through the crowded off-side cordon. Raced away past point in a flash"
9110,out Samson Run Out!! Absolute waste of a wicket! Samson is livid as he walks back to the hut but he is also partly to blame. Was an in-angler on a good length and batsman dabbed it towards the short mid-wicket region. Always was a risky run with bowler quickly moving across in his followthrough and there is a massive mix up with Samson way down the track. All three stumps to aim at and bowler doesn't miss. Not the start that the Royals were looking for. Samson run out (bowler) 0(0)
9111,"FOUR, crisply struck! Another delightful shot from batsman. Overpitched and he is well forward to this one, times the straight drive with aplomb to send it racing past the right of mid-off"
9112,"FOUR, typical Steven batsman! All wristy. Ambles down the pitch and uses those whippy wrists to time and place the flick in the gap wide of long-on"
9113,"FOUR, stays inside the crease this time, uncorks his wrists and flays the cut in the gap behind point"
9114,"1 run, skates down and flicks the flatter delivery off his pads to deep mid-wicket. 100-run partnership's up"
9115,"FOUR, poor delivery from bowler! Bowls a slower ball but he's dished it on batsman's pads, tickled away past short fine. Easy!"
9116,"FOUR, this is batting practice for Steven batsman. He had all the time in the world to smash this slower length ball outside off and smash it he does. Clears his front leg and clobbers it wide of the fielder at long-on"
9117,"FOUR, make that three in a row! Too full and batsman slices the drive behind point"
9118,"SIX, this is innovation at its very best! Moved across his off-stump and uses Morris' pace to lap the full ball high and over the fine leg fence"
9119,"FOUR, that's just a check shot and batsman timed that to perfection. Waits for the pitched up delivery to arrive and crunches it with a straight bat face, no heavy backlift but it still flies over the man at mid-off"
9120,"1 run, biffed to mid-off and that'll be Steven batsman's 8th IPL fifty"
9121,"out Caught by Chris Morris!! How often have we seen this? A batsman throwing it away after reaching the milestone. batsman uses his feet, looks to go straight and throws his weight into the lofted hit over mid-off, he seemed to have got enough height on that but Morris set himself cleverly on the edge of the long-off boundary to claim a well-judged catch. batsman c Chris Morris b bowler 50(32) [4s-8]"
9122,"FOUR, comes dancing down the pitch and punch-drives the full delivery to the left of mid-off, batsman batting with full freedom and he has got the license to do that"
9123,"FOUR, timed! That's what you get with class players like batsman. Just stands his ground, waits for the fullish delivery to arrive and chips the drive over cover with an air of confidence. All the way..."
9124,"FOUR, full toss around the knee roll, batsman stays still and flicks it over the square leg umpire. No need to run for those..."
9125,"out Caught by Shreyas Iyer!! batsman is disappointed with himself and rightly so. He's failed to take toll of a full toss. Doesn't really move around the crease, just looks to power it away over mid-wicket but doesn't get the required timing on that. Catching practice for Shreyas Iyer at long-on. batsman c Shreyas Iyer b bowler 8(8) [4s-1]"
9126,"2 runs, batsman drives this one to long-off and calls for two. The throw came in at the bowler's end and Turner just manages to get back in, the throw was a flat one but a direct-hit would have been curtains for the Austraian"
9127,"2 runs, relief for batsman! What a fantastic knock this has been. Notches up his second IPL century and raises his bat to acknowledge the crowd. There was no need for him to bat down the order. This is where he's at his best - as an opener. Plays the length delivery with soft hands to long-on and manages to storm back for two. Take a bow Jinx!"
9128,out Caught by Rutherford!! Hat-trick of golden ducks for batsman! Becomes the first ever batsman to get out for five successive ducks in T20 cricket. Can you believe it! Things going from bad to worse! Gets deceived due to the slower delivery once again and chips the fullish delivery straight to Rutherford at extra cover. batsman c Rutherford b bowler 0(1)
9129,"FOUR, not a great day for bowler in the field. Since that run-out of Samson, nothing has gone his way. Even this was a false shot but the end result is a boundary. Nothing's working for the speedster. Drags back the length on his delivery and batsman ends up top-edging it over the keeper's head as he hacks across the line"
9130,"FOUR, boundary to end the over but Morris wouldn't mind - concedes only 8 runs in it. This was in the slot and batsman heaves it into the vacant region at cow-corner. The fielder was perhaps inside the circle and that shall be four more for the all-rounder"
9131,"out Bowled!! You miss, I hit. bowler goes full and straight, very close to a yorker. batsman makes room to smash that but the speed is enough to beat him. Goes through his flashy drive and knocks over the middle-stick. Picks up the ball and hands over to bowler too. batsman b bowler 19(13) [4s-2]"
9132,"FOUR, that's a full toss on the pads and batsman whips it past the man at fine leg who had no chance to stop this. He was a touch too fine in order to cut this down"
9133,"FOUR, whipped over the infield! Clever batting from batsman, got one tossed up and he didn't go hard at this one. Just used his wrists and ensured that he got it over mid-wicket as there was nobody in the deep. Makes terrific contact and reaps the reward. He's looking good tonight"
9134,"out Bowled!! Bull's eye! bowler cleans up Parag with a full toss as the batsman backs away to smash the ball away. At the speed of which bowler is bowling, it's never so easy. The leg stump is uprooted but Rajashtan have managed to post an excellent score of 191/6. batsman b bowler 4(3) [4s-1]"
9135,"FOUR, just past a diving Rabada! Was always difficult for him to take this but made a heroic effort nevertheless. Pitched by bowler and batsman went for loft down the ground. Got it straight but Rabada from mid-on sensed it and moved swiftly to his left before diving mid-air. Past him and to the fence"
9136,"no run, Ishant spills a sitter! Embarrassing stuff from team's senior man. batsman shuffled well across for the sweep and skewed it aerially to short fine leg. Straightforward take but Ishant spills it. How costly will this be?"
9137,"SIX, superb hit! Adding insult to injury, is batsman. Charges down on seeing the flight and hoists it merrily straight down the ground. Plenty of elevation and also has the distance as this crashes into the sightscreen"
9138,"FOUR, Ishant won't want to watch this, his drop has started to cost heavily already. Flatter one from bowler and batsman gets across to sweep this well over short fine leg. Clean strike and more runs"
9139,"SIX, excellent hit from batsman! Refreshing intent from the team former captain and he is wading into the bowling. Short of a length from bowler and Jinks just backs away to flat-bat this down the ground. Such fine connection that it goes all the way. Superb stuff!"
9140,"FOUR, batsman is in overdrive in this Powerplay. Raining boundaries at the moment. bowler spills one on the pads and that's criminal with fine leg up. batsman just gets a tickle on it and sends it racing past that fielder to the fence in no time"
9141,"2 runs, superb running and it's an easy brace. Was knocked gently through mid-on and with the dimensions being as big as it is, there's a two to be had if you can run hard"
9142,"FOUR, fist pump from batsman as he gets to his fifty! Seems determined to make a statement tonight and to be honest, it's been his best knock in ages. Fractionally short and he dispatches the pull over mid-wicket. There is a man in the deep but Jinks has placed it wider. He is flowing freely at the moment, needs to bat through from team's POV"
9143,"FOUR, brilliant placement! There is a fine leg and deep mid-wicket in place but batsman has bisected them beautifully. Gets on the pads and he duly flicks it through square leg. Called for two but such is the timing that it leaves the deep fielders with no chance of getting to it"
9144,"FOUR, excellent placement from batsman! Uses his feet, gets closer to the pitch of the delivery and whiplashes it over mid-wicket, right in the gap between the fielders in the deep"
9145,"FOUR, batsman unleashing class! Skips out of his crease and plays a gorgeous inside out drive over extra cover with sublime timing"
9146,"FOUR, batsman is looking unstoppable at the moment! Picks the arm-ball, settles on one knee and paddles it fine of the fielder at short fine"
9147,"out Stumped!! Walks right past the googly, didn't have a clue about it! Fuller length from Rashid, pitched around middle and batsman was looking to work it through the on-side, expecting a leg-break. But he's wrong. He's also reaching for the ball, as it has pitched well short of him, and so the balance - the lack of it - takes him out of the crease. Excellent stumping from Bairstow. batsman st Bairstow b bowler 38(24) [4s-6 6s-1]"
9148,"FOUR, short of length outside off, guides it with an open face between backward point and short third man"
9149,"FOUR, great crack of the bat as batsman crunched this flat-batted swipe wide of deep midwicket. Sandeep's slower ball was short in length and sat up"
9150,"SIX, brings up his fifty in thunderous style! batsman roars back to form for team. Short ball, 116kph, and it goes soaring into the second tier"
9151,"FOUR, smashed away! A trifle too short from Rashid and batsman picked the length early. Swivelled and pulled it hard, bisecting deep mid-wicket and long-on perfectly"
9152,"FOUR, smacked away by batsman! Got down on his knees and swept this hard in front of square through the leg-side. Sandeep got across with a slide but couldn't palm it away properly"
9153,"SIX, batsman is putting on a show alright! This is what confidence can do. He's a different player now and in some mood. Gets a flattish low full toss that's sent over cow corner with a slog sweep. Such a clean hit and he stares at Rashid"
9154,"FOUR, he's in autopilot mode now, batsman! Gets to 8000 T20 runs! Not a bad ball, almost the perfect wide yorker from bowler but batsman is in the zone now. Waits deep in the crease and opens the bat face late. Bisects short third man and backward point easily"
9155,"FOUR, deft once again! batsman wants to finish this in a hurry. Slightly shorter this time, not much room but he plays is late with an open face. Gets it wide of Bairstow and short third man had no chance"
9156,"SIX, smokedddddddddddd! Nothing much you can do when batsman is hitting them like this. Not even Rashid has any answers. Tossed it up, inviting the big hit and that it was for sure. Blasted away by batsman over long-on for a mammoth blow"
9157,"FOUR, 15 off the over! batsman is motoring towards yet another IPL century! Too short from Rashid and the Aussie sits back to pull this away through backward square leg. Short fine leg is the only man there"
9158,"SIX, this is some hitting from batsman! Slower and short, climbs onto the short ball and muscles it over deep mid-wicket. Another huge hit!"
9159,"out Caught by Bairstow!! batsman is walking! No century but hasn't he put on a show tonight or what! Was a good short ball from bowler and batsman got rushed on the pull. There was a definite top edge as it went through to Bairstow who took a stunning one-handed catch, diving to his left. The umpire was probably blinded and didn't know what to do. batsman did the right thing, would have been out anyway if team reviewed this. Ends a sensational knock from one of IPL's and T20 cricket's legend. batsman c Bairstow b bowler 96(53) [4s-9 6s-6]"
9160,"SIX, that's the game! Slower ball and Jadhav charged down for the swipe over mid-wicket. Was a skimmer and Pandey in the deep showed good awareness as he caught this mid-air in an attempt to palm it back. Managed to parry it as well but the foot touched the ground outside the ropes Just 2 needed now!"
9161,out Caught by Shankar!! Anti-climax for the team fans in the stadium. batsman wanted the winning hit but departs. Ends up miscuing the pull and top edges it straight in the air. Dolly for Shankar at mid-off and he gobbles it up. It's been a scratchy season for batsman and today is another innings of that kind. batsman c Shankar b bowler 21(25) [4s-1]
9162,"out batsman Run Out!! Appeal for a run-out taken upstairs! It's a direct-hit, mind you. Looks very close. Although batsman had put in a dive at the bowler's end, it's not enough. Touch and go! The batsman had driven the ball to Hooda at mid-off and a direct-hit at the bowler's end brings curtains to the South African's stay at the crease. Another awful start for team this season. batsman run out (Hooda) 1(7)"
9163,"FOUR, batsman gets off the mark with a glorious off-drive. Gets hold of the overpitched delivery, presents the full face of his willow and creams it past the fielder at mid-off. Great shot to open his account"
9164,"FOUR, that shall give him some confidence! Tad full in length around middle and leg, batsman goes down on his knee and sweeps it uppishly over square leg. Almost went the distance"
9165,"SIX, short of length on middle, this off-cutter from Khaleel sits up nicely to be whacked. And batsman isn't one to refuse such opportunities. Belts it over the square leg boundary"
9166,"FOUR, length ball outside off, batsman plants his foot back in the crease and hoists it over extra cover. Extraordinary shot, generating all that power from the bottom hand. Vijay Shankar's diving effort in the deep not enough"
9167,"FOUR, short balls have had a history of troubling batsman, true, but not at 118kph. Muscles this pull well in front of square"
9168,"FOUR, slower length ball on leg stump, too easy for batsman who is well aware of short fine leg's presence inside the ring. Just whips it past the man"
9169,"FOUR, this isn't intentional, but it's useful. Length ball outside off, batsman had charged down looking to biff no matter what. So it doesn't matter to him that the ball's far away. He throws his hands at it, and ends up slicing it off the outside half over short third man"
9170,"FOUR, fourth boundary of the over, third one in a row. The shackles have been broken. Slower ball on middle, batsman swipes agriculturally and gets enough off the inside half to impart the legs to roll into the square leg boundary"
9171,"SIX, massive over for team, 22 off it. Short of length on leg stump, pulls it away ferociously and hits the cushions on the full"
9172,"SIX, this time he does get under the short ball, and absolutely pummels it over backward square. It's his favourite pull shot, and bowler's lack of bounce isn't going to dissuade him once the length's there"
9173,"FOUR, Rashid jumps away from the path of this bullet-drive from batsman. He had made the mistake of overpitching, but he wasn't going to make the mistake of risking himself once batsman drilled it back. Smartly so"
9174,"FOUR, short ball outside off, seemed like an intentional dab from batsman, although Warner wasn't far from getting a hand at slip. With the pace of Rashid, this absolutely flew off batsman's bat"
9175,"1 run, dropped by Bairstow! It was a meaty outside edge from batsman, who was looking to swing through the line of this full ball. Bairstow dives to his right, goes with one hand, but it doesn't stick"
9176,"byes, FOUR, goes right through batsman, but bounces over the stumps. That's beaten everyone. An absolute ripper from Rashid"
9177,"out Caught by Dhoni!! An excellent IPL comes to a sorry end for Jonny. And bowler as he has done throughout this IPL delivers for team with the new ball. It was a quicker one and was wide of off, it skids off the deck, takes the outside edge of batsman who plays down the wrong line. And Dhoni makes no mistake, he never does! batsman c Dhoni b bowler 0(2)"
9178,"FOUR, intent from batsman straightaway, much better from the Karnataka lad. It was a flighted delivery and was spinning back into Manish, he plunges forward and lofts it straight down the ground for a boundary"
9179,"FOUR, Pandey is absolutely belting it today! Sees the slower full ball dip outside off and times the slap-drive to perfection, raced away to the deep cover fence"
9180,"FOUR, one of batsman's best IPL innings this, brings up his fifty in 25 balls. Picks the slower ball early, times his swivel and pulls it past the diving left hand of short fine"
9181,"1 run, quicker on middle and leg, tucked away into the leg-side and that'll be 43rd IPL fifty for David batsman"
9182,"FOUR, he's in overdrive is batsman! Jumps out of his crease, shows no signs of fear and pumps bowler straight down the ground for a one-bounce boundary"
9183,"out Stumped!! Gives it plenty of air and catches batsman on the move. No balance from pocket rocket, swings wildly and the bottom hand comes off while doing so, his back foot got dragged too far in the process and Dhoni ain't missing that stumping chance. batsman st Dhoni b bowler 57(45) [4s-3 6s-2]"
9184,"SIX, effortless stroke from Vijay batsman! Lets the googly dip and marmalizes it for a 84-metre maximum over long-on"
9185,"SIX, dispatched! Short in length around off and batsman pumps it over the cow corner for half a dozen! Sweetly timed blow"
9186,"FOUR, another fine shot by batsman! Looks in sublime touch. Reaches out for the overpitched delivery wide ball and chips it over cover-point. There were two fielders inside the circle and this ball cleared them by some distance"
9187,"1 run, Raina drops a sitter! Not only his batting, but his fielding hasn't been great either. A couple of misfields earlier in the innings and now he puts one down. Pandey got deceived due to the slower delivery as he miscued it towards mid-off where Raina fails to cling on to the catch"
9188,"FOUR, in the slot and batsman drags it over the infield at mid-wicket. There were two fielders in the deep but this was placed right into the gap as he heaved the length ball across"
9189,out Caught by Jadeja!! Deepak bowler ends his spell with a wicket. Just 7 runs in that over. batsman was looking to clear the deep mid-wicket fence with this heave but he couldn't get the timing right. Holes out to the fielder in the deep and that brings an end to batsman's handy cameo. batsman c Jadeja b bowler 26(20) [4s-2 6s-1]
9190,"FOUR, you cannot miss your length by an inch against batsman. It was marginally short and was directed on the body, batsman gets in an excellent position and times the pull shot brilliantly. It goes over square leg and races to the fence"
9191,"SIX, batsman attacks bowler straightaway and gets a maximum. This is going to be an interesting battle. It was a flighted one and was on the stumps, batsman takes a good stride forward and lofts it straight down the ground for a maximum"
9192,"SIX, Pandey Ji means business today! He has promoted to number three and he looks in no mood to waste this opportunity. It was an offie on the stumps and batsman larrups it over long-off for a maximum"
9193,"FOUR, that's a tennis forehand, Roger would have been proud of that. It was a good length delivery and was just wide of off, nothing wrong with the delivery. But batsman flat-bats it wide of the bowler and the timing was so good that it canters to the fence"
9194,"FOUR, smashed! It as full and was on the stumps, batsman pumps it down the ground, bowler did well to get his head out of the way. It runs along the carpet for another boundary"
9195,"FOUR, flighted delivery down the leg-side, batsman goes deep in the crease and tucks it wide of the leg-slip, it beats short fine and will reach the boundary too. Pandey is on fire!"
9196,"FOUR, Dhoni shouts Na na na from behind as it was a short one, it was wide of off too. batsman rocks back and cuts it wide of short third. Another boundary for Pandey!"
9197,"FOUR, dispatches the first delivery of bowler for a boundary. It was wide of off, batsman plunges forward and tonks it wide of deep mid-wicket for a boundary. It spilts the gap to perfection"
9198,"1 run, sharp bumper on the face, batsman was surprised by how quickly it came to him. He mistimes the pull totally and ends up hitting it just to the left of the side wicket. Bravo charges quickly towards but fails to pick up the ball cleanly. And he is gutted with himself"
9199,"SIX, launched!! Slightly fuller and in the arc for batsman, he stays low and smokes it into the stands over cow corner"
9200,"SIX, that's the biggest of the lot! Pandey on fire...picks up the flight, gets underneath it and hammers it high and soaring into the second tier over long-on"
9201,"FOUR, batsman is underway! Fullish ball outside off, batsman reaches out and throws the kicthen sink. Sliced over point and the Universe Boss collects his first boundary"
9202,"FOUR, nicely done! Not a shot that you'd normally assocciate with batsman. Short of a length ball outside off and the lefty used the bowler's pace to guide it through backward point and short third man"
9203,"FOUR, 14 off the opening over! bowler continues to have a terrible IPL. A wide half-volley outside off and batsman flays it over backward point. Third boundary for batsman!"
9204,"FOUR, another bad ball! Slants in a back of a length delivery at 137kph, straighter line as well. batsman, with one leg off ground, controls the pull through backward square leg"
9205,"FOUR, horror ball! An overpitched delivery on the pads - almost pleading the batsman to punish. And, KL doesn't miss out. Flicks it handsomely behind square on the leg-side"
9206,"out Caught by Southee!! Ali strikes with his very first ball. His introduction was too tempting for batsman, who advanced down and wanted to loft it straight. But he gets too close to the pitch of it, and miscues it off the toe-end for a simple catch at long-off. Kohli explodes in celebration, probably even gave a send-off. Two new batsmen at the crease now. batsman c Southee b bowler 42(27) [4s-7 6s-1]"
9207,"SIX, he has got his eye in and he has smashed this one for a gigantic six. It was a fuller length delivery on the stumps, batsman backs away, clears his leg, gets under it and tonks it over long-off for a maximum"
9208,"SIX, another six. batsman gave himself room again, bowler follows him but batsman still had enough room to clear his arm and dispatch it over long-off again"
9209,"SIX, third six off the over! In the same area again. It was very full and on the leg-stump, batsman gets under it and launches it over long-off again. Into the stands"
9210,"FOUR, batsman looks in his elements today. It was a slower one on the stumps, batsman picks it up early, delays his bat swing and smashes it over cover for a boundary"
9211,"SIX, Mr batsman why were you hiding in the dressing room in the previous matches. It was a flighted one on a good length, batsman backs away, makes room and dispatches it over long-off"
9212,"SIX, fifth six for batsman. He is putting on a show here. batsman clears his leg, keeps his shape and tonks it over long-on for another six. He is dealing in sixes at the moment!"
9213,"FOUR, batsman welcomes bowler with a four. It was a good length delivery on the stumps, batsman wanted to cut it wide of backward point, gets an outside edge and it races fine of third man for a boundray"
9214,"FOUR, back-to-back boundaries for batsman. It was a slower one on the stumps, batsman picks it up early and powers the pull shot wide of deep mid-wicket for another four"
9215,"1 run, the horror IPL for team in the field continues. It was a sitter, an absolute sitter. Kohli must be livid, he has turned his face away from the camera. It was a length delivery on the stumps, batsman fails to time the heave. It was in the air for an eternity and Stoinis at long-on had all the time in the world to settle himself. He spills it though"
9216,"out Caught by de Villiers!! ABD dives and ABD snaffles it. Kohli with the fist pump. It was a length delivery on the stumps, batsman wanted to smash it over long-on. He hasn't timed it all evening and he failed to do so on this occassion also. ABD dives to his right emphatically and takes a beauty! batsman c de Villiers b bowler 24(25) [4s-2]"
9217,"out Caught by de Villiers!! ABD takes it again. He is having a dream of a match. And the dangerous batsman departs. team are surely winning it now. He fails to get under the delivery, swings hard at it. It goes a long way up in the air and lands in safe hands of ABD. batsman c de Villiers b bowler 46(28) [4s-1 6s-5]"
9218,"SIX, wow! batsman has dispatched it for a six. Can he replicate MSD? Yadav misses the yorker, batsman comes under it and pumps it over long-on"
9219,"out Caught by Kohli!! No, no, no. batsman is no Dhoni. And he has hit it straight to Kohli who it seems was asking batsman what the heck he was doing? batsman fails to get under it and mistimes it, hits it straight to Kohli at long-on. batsman absolutely throws his gloves after crossing the fence. He is frustrated, well that's an understatement. batsman c Kohli b bowler 6(2) [6s-1]"
9220,"out Caught by Parthiv Patel!! Two in two for Yadav. And he will be on a hat-trick! Umesh has won the match for team. It was a short of length delivery near the left shoulder, batsman was hurried on the pull shot. It clips his glove and Parthiv takes a good catch diving to his left. batsman c Parthiv Patel b bowler 0(1)"
9221,"1 run, dropped! Kohli drops a dolly. He might have been more worried about the celebration. Slower one on the stumps, batsman is completely deceived and he still goes through with the big hit, mistimes it towards long-on and the team skipper makes a mess of it"
9222,"FOUR, batsman greets the new bowler with a boundary. Shortish ball at 139.7kph, batsman stays back in the crease and pulls it straight of mid-on. He got it almost off the toe end, but that's more than enough to run away for a boundary"
9223,"FOUR, shot! Class written all over it. A short of length ball at 145.1kph, batsman gets on top of it and punches it superbly through the covers, beating a diving Chahal"
9224,"FOUR, Saini over-corrects. He doles out a half-volley at 146.4kph outside off. batsman gets forward and plays the lofted off-drive over extra cover"
9225,"SIX, this is bad bowling! A full toss and batsman doesn't need second invitation to put it away. Hoisted over long-on for half-a-dozen"
9226,"out Caught by de Villiers!! batsman's gone, Kohli is pumped. Umesh Yadav shortens his length and batsman is a touch late into his stroke. The southpaw was trying to heave it away and got it slightly off the top edge. Almost went the distance, but there was a fielder manning the fence. AB, at long-on, takes a calm catch. batsman c de Villiers b bowler 23(10) [4s-4 6s-1]"
9227,"FOUR, wow! Those wrists. Full ball on leg - a hit-me delivery and batsman whips it over mid-wicket"
9228,"FOUR, stylish from Mayank batsman, whipping a length ball round his front pad. Nice bent front knee there, as he picked it away from off stump to the long leg boundary"
9229,"FOUR, if the last one was batsman's brilliance, this one is bowler's mediocrity. Strays on leg stump and is glanced fine for four"
9230,"SIX, this one drifts in on leg, sliding on with the arm, and batsman just lifts it through the line over long-on. A shot requiring great ability, especially as he's not to the pitch"
9231,"FOUR, now he waits on the inevitable short ball and latches onto it. Cut away through the gap at point"
9232,"FOUR, that's been absolutely lambasted through extra cover. Back of a length outside off, batsman slaps it red, leaves a vapour trail enroute to the boundary"
9233,"FOUR, good length ball outside off, tentative footwork from batsman. But it doesn't cost him. Instead, he benefits. The loose poke results in an outside edge which runs away fine to the third man boundary"
9234,"FOUR, short of length at the body, batsman's eyes aren't on the ball all the way through, but he's controlled the pull nicely behind square. And the timing is brilliant, even though he's checked the shot"
9235,"SIX, skims over long-off's reach! Picked the googly there, which was overpitched anyway, and hammered it down the ground. Would've been worried for a brief moment, as he hadn't found the elevation, but it's high enough to escape Saini's one-handed leap"
9236,"FOUR, short ball on off stump, which to be fair isn't that short as batsman's made it out to be. He collapses his back leg to get low and swats it wide of long-on"
9237,"out Caught by Chahal!! He's got this pull high on the bat, and the miscue is taken at midwicket. bowler screams in celebration, Kohli screams louder. Short of length, it was onto batsman quicker than he expected, and so there was no timing on the shot. Much needed for the team. batsman c Chahal b bowler 35(21) [4s-5 6s-1]"
9238,"FOUR, 135ks hint of width outside off and Parthiv lashes on it with a fierce cut through point. team and batsman off the mark in style"
9239,"FOUR, 137ks, keep that coming says batsman...leans onto his front foot and hammers the pitched up delivery straight back over his skipper"
9240,"no run, dropped! Hardus Viljeon is the fielder. Full and swinging into the pads, batsman unleashes his whippy wrists and sends a dolly of a catch to mid-wicket where Viljeon makes an absolute Bisi Bele Bath (dal rice) out of it. Oh dear!"
9241,"FOUR, adding insult to injury. This one sits up outside off on a good length and batsman doesn't need any second invitation, holds his pose and crunches it wide of cover-point"
9242,"FOUR, make that two in a row! This one's slightly wide of extra cover but batsman has timed the punch-drive to perfection"
9243,"FOUR, a gimme on the pads, batsman gets inside the line and helps it away to the fine leg fence, bowler's pace takes care of the rest"
9244,"SIX, much needed six for batsman and team. Also gets the crowd out of their slumber. Tosses up the leg-break and offers space for batsman to free his arms, he muscles it over long-off"
9245,"FOUR, can't bowl short at 135.2ks to batsman, he rocks back and nails the pull over mid-wicket. Couple of bounces and into the fence. team will hope this can get AB going"
9246,"SIX, and again.. bowler persists with the short of length delivery, this time batsman decides to put him in the crowd, quick swivel on the back foot and the pull is sent over deep mid-wicket"
9247,"SIX, a hit-me delivery and batsman bludgeons it. Half tracker and batsman picked his spot - deep mid-wicket and sends the ball sailing into the crowd with a pull shot"
9248,"FOUR, that's a freebie from bowler! A low full toss at 139.7kph on the pads, batsman flicks it fine and the ball reaches the fence in a jiffy. The boundary brings up AB's fifty!"
9249,"SIX, watch out, those in the press box! Off-pace ball from bowler, but he's doled out a half-volley. AB batsman gets underneath it and bludgeons it downtown for a massive six"
9250,"SIX, slower ball at 124.2kph, it was wider outside off and batsman had to reach out for it. Slightly bends his back leg and lofts it over long-off"
9251,"SIX, back-to-back sixes! Almost an action replay off the previous ball. batsman was clearing his front leg, bowler bowls another slower delivery and AB smokes it over long-off"
9252,"SIX, make that three in a row! This one's landed on the roof! An above-waist full toss - not called a no-ball though. batsman, surprised by the height of the ball, takes his eyes off the ball, but managed to heave it over long leg. Incredible! Gayle, meanwhile, suggests that it was a fair delivery. Another non-no-ball controversy at the Chinnaswamy?"
9253,"SIX, batsman moves into the 80s. bowler bowls length - a crime at this stage and AB slogs it over cow corner for another sixer"
9254,"FOUR, full toss and batsman has flicked it away through backward square leg. team nearing 200!"
9255,"SIX, 17 off the over with two balls to go! In the slot and batsman has smoked it over long-on"
9256,"FOUR, high full toss - just below waist - and sliding down leg. batsman helps it on its way to the fine leg fence"
9257,"FOUR, one bounce and over the ropes! batsman picks the length early, swivels and bullies the pull shot over square leg umpire, fine leg had no chance"
9258,"SIX, 27 runs off the final over! Poor bowling from bowler. Another length delivery, sits up nicely for batsman, who swings his bat hard and deposits it over long-on"
9259,"out Caught by Mandeep!! batsman throws it away once again. Looks to thump the drive over the ring, but gets hit high on the bat and Mandeep takes a dolly of a catch (head-high) at extra cover. bowler always gets a bit of extra zip with his pace and the ball seem to have arrived much quicker than batsman anticipated. batsman c Mandeep b bowler 13(8) [4s-2]"
9260,"FOUR, 142ks sits up nicely outside off, AB thrashes it with a cross bat swing past the diving left hand of mid-wicket"
9261,"SIX, slower ball in the slot for batsman. Doesn't move an inch, just pumps it for a clean maximum straight down the ground"
9262,"FOUR, juicy length delivery outside off, Parthiv had plenty of time and he takes full toll of it, lifts the drive over mid-off with an air of nonchalance"
9263,"FOUR, full toss outside off, Parthiv leans back a touch and slices the drive behind point. The height on that seemed a bit touch-and-go but guess the umpire got it right"
9264,"FOUR, Parthiv is belting it to all corners. Poor bowling from bowler, gives plenty of width on offer outside off and that's been smashed over cover in a jiffy"
9265,"SIX, too easy for batsman! Angling in and perfect length to hoick, he creams it over mid-wicket for scintillating maximum"
9266,"out Caught by Ashwin!! The Ashwin duo does it. batsman stands in disbelief, he is cursing himself as he walks back to the pavilion. A well flighted delivery around middle and leg and thus, Parthiv thought he could flick it away into the leg-side, wasn't to be. Might have played the shot a touch too early and the leading edge pops up straight to the team skipper at extra cover. batsman c Ashwin b bowler 43(24) [4s-7 6s-2]"
9267,"FOUR, off the mark with a boundary, although a streaky one. Legbreak outside off, Moeen seeks to drive and feeds a thick outside edge which flies fine past the fielder at short third"
9268,"out Bowled!! bowler is jumping in joy and he has every reason to be so. Throws in a slider and he has beaten batsman all ends up, there was a huge gap between bat (on the lazy drive) and pad and the ball snuck through at a cunning pace to rattle middle and leg. batsman b bowler 4(5) [4s-1]"
9269,"out Caught by Mandeep!! Stunned silence at the Chinnaswamy. They lost three wickets in three overs and are now in big trouble. Clever change of pace, on a length as well, Nath presses forward and has to check his shot, spoons a sitter to cover. batsman c Mandeep b bowler 3(7)"
9270,"out Bowled!! Chopped on! bowler strikes and early troubles for team. A back of a length delivery at 140.9kph wide of off. It was there to be hit, but Lynn was lethargic as he threw his bat at it without any feet movement. Gets a big inside edge which cannons onto this sticks. Replays show that the ball nipped in a touch. batsman b bowler 0(3)"
9271,"leg byes, FOUR, drifts one on the pads and batsman fails to put bat on the tickle. The ball brushes the thigh pad and beats the diving keeper to run away to fine leg"
9272,"FOUR, uppish, but in the gap. bowler offers width on this short of length delivery and batsman doesn't go hard at it. Stays back in the crease and dabs it aerially through the gap between backward point and cover-point. He used the bowler's pace (143.4kph) to good effect"
9273,"SIX, much needed shackle-breaker for batsman and team. Gopal drags back the length and batsman is all over it, quickly pouncing back in his crease and nailing the pull over deep mid-wicket"
9274,"FOUR, cheeky! team need a kick on and who better than their skipper. batsman waits for the leg-break and he opens the bat face at the last second, the ball races past the diving short third man fielder"
9275,"FOUR, sloppy! Binny has just gifted three runs. Nothing but a nudge to long-on and he came racing in to stop the second, the batsmen were never going to take it, overruns the ball and allows it to trickle into the fence"
9276,"FOUR, batsman getting the momentum for team. A low dipping full toss outside off, batsman creams the drive past extra cover and long-off had no chance to get across"
9277,"SIX, batsman joins the act. Big over for team, 25 off it and brings the innings back on track. Googly in the slot, batsman bends a bit and muscles the slog sweep into the crowd near deep mid-wicket"
9278,"SIX, Archer looks around in disbelief. He's not sure how that cleared the rope. Short of length around the hips, batsman is on the hop as he plays the flick and the ball keeps sailing over backward square leg"
9279,"out Narine Run Out!! Oh no! What have you done batsman? team didn't need this against the run of play. Slower delivery is nurdled in front of fine leg, batsman is always looking for the second but he should know his partners well, Narine is not the swiftest and he's relcutant to go but does so after seeing his skipper next to him. Aaron throws to the bowler's end and Narine is nowhere near the frame. Narine run out (Aaron/Rahane) 11(8) [4s-1 6s-1]"
9280,"SIX, sails into the crowd. Not the delivery to bowl on this surface - short and outside off, batsman at no point in time tried to keep the cut down, used the pace on the track and slashed it over backward point"
9281,"FOUR, finishes his spell with a boundary. But that still doesn't spoil his figures - 4-1-20-2. bowler stopped and caught his hamstring and then went back to rebowl this final ball. A bit of a niggle might have hampered his line and length - short and outside off, batsman slaps the cut square and it races off the turf to beat sweeper cover"
9282,"1 run, dropped! Oh no Stuart! That is the last thing you want to do to a batsman like Russell. Slower short of length delivery outside off, Russell delays his slap and still hits it straight to sweeper cover, Binny bends down and lets it slip out of his grasp. How costly would that be?"
9283,"SIX, he's already starting to hurt them. Slower delivery on the stumps, Russell goes deep in the crease with a cleared front leg and then uses that raw power of his to deposit it into the deep mid-wicket stand"
9284,"SIX, shot! The only thing wrong with the delivery was it was too straight, on middle and leg, batsman stays deep in the crease and picks it up nonchalantly over long leg. He just manages to clear the rope"
9285,"1 run, fifty for batsman. He needed this. team needed this. They needed their captain back in form and leading from the front and batsman has done just that today. Back of a length around off, batsman waits and steers it down to third man"
9286,"1 run, dropped! Once is a sin. What do you call dropping a guy like Russell twice? Prashant Chopra, on as a substitute, puts down the skier. Short of length outside off, Russell had to reach out for his muscled hoick to leg and all he could manage was a toe-end straight up, Chopra circles underneath near point and spills it. Smith is not a happy captain"
9287,"out Caught by Riyan Parag!! bowler wins the Caribbean battle. Third time lucky for team. Binny and Chopra can't breathe easy now. No fireworks from Russell today. A good short delivery that had height on it, Russell had to fetch the pull from above his head, he cue-ends it and picks out Parag at deep mid-wicket. The youngster didn't flinch while taking such a high pressure catch. batsman c Riyan Parag b bowler 14(14) [6s-1]"
9288,"SIX, just over. That last delivery somewhat ruins bowler's figures - 4-0-32-1. He was unleashed on a surface that aided him and the tall pacer has repaid the decision. This was a back of a length delivery and batsman was waiting for it, goes deep in the crease and pumps it over long-on. Not much Stokes could do there"
9289,"FOUR, nicely played. bowler deceived batsman with a slower ball, but the latter adjusts well to roll his wrist and flick it fine past the fielder at 45. Good start to the over"
9290,"out Caught by Rahane!! Gone! batsman does not make a mark at Eden Gardens. Another cutter and batsman wanted to heave it into the crowd, does not generate enough power and mistimes it towards deep mid-wicket, where the safest hands are under it. Rahane runs to his right and takes a good catch. batsman c Rahane b bowler 5(3) [4s-1]"
9291,"FOUR, with all the power hitters back in the hut, the onus falls on batsman to get team to a good score. He waits for the slower delivery and back cuts it behind point - bisecting short third man and backward point expertly"
9292,"FOUR, Rahane almost pulls off a stunner. Slower short of length delivery and batsman takes it on, the pull goes in front of square and Rahane covered a lot of ground from deep mid-wicket, dives full length to his right and gets both hands, but the ball pops out once he hit the surface and rolls into the ad cushions. He might have hurt himself there"
9293,"SIX, wow! How did he generate the power? Back of the hand slower delivery, sits up outside off and batsman still had a lot to do, he forehands the slap over extra cover and it travels the distance"
9294,"SIX, consecutive sixes to end Archer's spell. This short ball was around leg-stump, batsman gets inside the line and plays the pick up pull to send it sailing into the crowd"
9295,"FOUR, one bounce and over the ropes. batsman needs to keep going for the final four balls. bowler missed the yorker and batsman was up for it, deep in the crease and whipping it with a lot of bottom hand to cow corner"
9296,"SIX, this time it goes the distance. batsman also gets to his highest IPL score. Can he get a hundred? bowler is bowling it in the slot and batsman muscles it with all his might over long-on. Smith has a worried look"
9297,"SIX, bowler is not learning. He keeps bowling those slower balls right in the batsman's arc, batsman sets up with a good base deep in the crease and then swings through the line, straight back over the bowler"
9298,"FOUR, good shot! Used the bowler's pace and Gill collects his first boundary. A short-and-wide ball at 145.6kph, Gill hops and scythes it behind backward point. No chance for the third man fielder to even get close to it"
9299,"FOUR, batsman gets into an awkward position, but manages to collect a boundary. A short ball that climbs at the batter, but the line was leg-stump. Rana, despite not being in a great position, managed to get a glove on it. Raced away to the fine leg fence"
9300,"FOUR, put away! A short-and-wide delivery at 150kph, Gill stands tall in his crease and cuts it superbly behind backward point. Reaches the fence in a jiffy"
9301,out Bowled!! That's a beauty from Varun bowler! The slower knuckle ball from the pacer swung in sharply and Gill couldn't account for it. He was looking to ease it through the off-side and ended up playing outside the line of it. A faint inside edge and the ball crashes onto the stumps. Varun bowler has removed both the openers. batsman b bowler 14(14) [4s-2]
9302,"FOUR, a poor ball! bowler darts a rank half-tracker outside off, cut hard wide of backward point. Easily put away"
9303,"out Caught by Aaron!! team are struggling here. Varun Aaron in action again. A quick-ish googly that skids through off the deck outside off. On seeing the line, batsman went hard on the cut. He didn't bother to keep it down and paid the price. Offers a dolly to backward point and Aaron doesn't err. batsman c Aaron b bowler 21(26) [4s-3]"
9304,"FOUR, edged and four! Another away-turner and batsman cut hard from the crease. Gets a fat edge that eludes first slip and runs away to third man for a boundary"
9305,"FOUR, up and over! batsman is away and so are the Royals. It was on a fuller length and was wide of off, batsman plunges forward and lofts it over cover. He gets enough bat on it to clear the in-field and once it lands, it races towards the fence"
9306,"FOUR, clears the in-field with ease. This is fearless cricket from batsman. It was missing from his game when he was the skipper. It was in the slot for him on a fuller length and he hoicks it over mid-on for another four"
9307,"SIX, gee! How on earth that cleared the ropes. batsman heaved at this good length delivery, it came off the toe end of the blade and went straight down the ground for a maximum"
9308,"FOUR, he has whipped it away magnificently well. Gee! This man can bat. bowler misses the yorker, it ends up being in the slot for batsman and he uses his wrists to smash it wide of long-on"
9309,"out Caught by A Russell!! Miscues the googly off the toe-end, and this is a brilliant catch at the edge of the boundary from Andre Russell. He leapt up, grabbed it overhead with both hands, and then landed with his feet just inside the ropes. batsman is done for this season, a rather disappointing one for him! batsman c A Russell b bowler 11(10) [4s-2]"
9310,"SIX, nails the slog-sweep over cow corner! Got into position quickly and unleashed his arms across the line of this delivery"
9311,"FOUR, thick top-edge on the pull from Parag, loops over the keeper's head and bounces once before crossing the ropes"
9312,"out Caught by Rinku Singh!! batsman goes for the slog-sweep and holes out at deep midwicket. Considering spin has done all the damage so far, and that this is bowler's final over, this isn't the smartest shot. He doesn't connect as well as he would've wanted, and gives Rinku Singh a simple catch in the deep. batsman c Rinku Singh b bowler 11(11) [6s-1]"
9313,"FOUR, premeditates this. He walks across the stumps for the scoop. His determination enables him to adjust to the length, which is slightly shorter than what he hopes for, but nevertheless, he's able to paddle it away past short fine leg"
9314,"FOUR, sizzling drive through extra cover, punishing this overpitched delivery from Russell. team are still in this while this pair's around"
9315,"FOUR, short ball outside off, a response to Gopal's charge off the previous ball you'd think. And Gopal's expecting it. He waits on the back foot and slaps it through backward point"
9316,"FOUR, short ball again, this time much straighter, and so Gopal pulls it hard through square leg for four more"
9317,"FOUR, this is brilliant from Gopal, again proving his value and ability with the bat. Such a terrific cricket shot. Flighted up outside off, he stretches onto the ball and creams the drive through extra cover. Superb timing to beat long-off"
9318,"out Caught by Shubman Gill!! Full ball on off, Gopal's loft is a mistimed one, and it's taken comfortably by long-off running in. Probably didn't need to press the trigger so early. batsman c Shubman Gill b bowler 18(9) [4s-4]"
9319,"FOUR, short of length at the body, Archer looked like he was expecting it. He thumps the pull well in front of square"
9320,"SIX, takes bowler on and whacks this length ball straight back down. Flat-batted slap that skims over the boundary ropes in front of the sightscreen"
9321,"FOUR, shuffles across to a ball that's straying on leg stump and helps it fine for four. What an over this is turning out to be for team"
9322,"FOUR, that's raced off the inside edge into the fine leg boundary. Nothing anyone could've done about it. Length ball homing in on off, Parag swings off his feet and sees his luck smiling on him"
9323,"SIX, dug in short at pace, good height too, but it's flown into the crowd. Parag has swivelled across quickly and helped the pull over backward square. This is sensational batting"
9324,"SIX, just clears Carlos Brathwaite at long-on! Slower short ball outside off, seemed like a mishit initially as Parag swung the forehand into the sky, but it kept going and going"
9325,"out Hit Wkt!! Oh dear, Parag's bat has clattered into the stumps. He was rushed for pace on this short ball, just managed some glove on the attempted pull but proceeded to disturb the stumps on the followthrough. That's a bit unlucky, if you can call it that. What a knock he's played though to put his team in pole position. batsman hit wkt b bowler 47(31) [4s-5 6s-2]"
9326,"FOUR, flies off the outside edge over short third man! Full ball outside off, Archer swings for the rafters, only just reaching it with the toe-end and slicing it into the boundary"
9327,"SIX, it takes two balls for Archer to wrap it up! This one's right in the slot from bowler to which Archer clears the front leg and wallops it over long-off. Sensational win for the Rajasthan Royals"
9328,"FOUR, brilliant from batsman! Class written all over it. It was on a good length and was just wide of off, batsman waits for it to arrive and opens the face of the bat at the very last moment. He found the gap between backward point and cover fielder to perfection"
9329,"SIX, that's a high quality shot from a high-quality batsman. It was in the slot for batsman on a fuller length, he keeps his shape brilliantly and larrups it straight down the ground for a maximum. He held his pose for a wee bit too! Gee! He enjoyed it and so did we"
9330,"SIX, batsman sends it into the crowd. It was a short of length delivery, batsman backs away, makes room, makes excellent use of good bounce and powers it over deep backward point for a maximum"
9331,"FOUR, nothing much wrong with this delivery but batsman is in magnificent touch now. He identifies the length early, gets in a good position and smashes it wide of deep mid-wicket for a boundary"
9332,"FOUR, this is excellent from batsman. He is giving the treatment to the young man. There was just a little bit of width on this delivery, batsman opens the face of the bat at the very last moment, made brilliant use of his wrists and guides it wide of backward point for another four"
9333,"out Lbw!! bowler gets the first breakthrough for team. Eden has found it's voice back. It was pitched in that brilliant area around off and on a fuller length, it straightened after hitting the deck. batsman plays down the wrong line. It pinned him on the pads and looked plumb. batsman did well not to waste a review for it. batsman lbw b bowler 34(21) [4s-5 6s-1]"
9334,"no run, batsman went for an across the line shot, and he was hit on the pads. He just managed to get an inside edge to it and that saved him there. An excellent over from bowler"
9335,"out Bowled!! Cheekiness gets the better of batsman. He was trying to be too cute there, wanted to paddle it first then realised the line isn't there to play that shot. And went for a steer, in the end he got himself in a tangle and played a nothing shot. The googly went between his bat and pad and smashed the stumps. bowler is pumped! batsman b bowler 22(15) [6s-2]"
9336,"FOUR, that's edged and four. batsman needs a little bit of luck to change his fortune. He drives down the wrong line, it clipped his outside edge and it went wide of first slip for a boundary"
9337,"out Bowled!! bowler has gone through the defence of batsman. And this match has changed all of a sudden in the last couple of overs. Sensational spell from bowler. There was nothing special in the delivery, batsman just misses it and it smashes his stumps. The decision of DK to give the extra over to bowler has worked brilliantly. batsman b bowler 2(6)"
9338,"no run, bowler drops an absolute dolly. You can't expect an easier catch than this. And he has no one else to blame. It spins back into batsman who chips it straight back to bowler. But he wasn't expecting it at all and ends up spilling it"
9339,"FOUR, that's the batsman we know. He backs away, creates room and thumps this over mid-off for a boundary. No stopping that!"
9340,"FOUR, missed out on his century by 4 runs in the previous game and here's a boundary two nights later. Short of a length outside off and Watto punches it firmly through the gap at covers. Lewis goes for the chase, puts in a dive near the fence as well but the momentum takes it away to the fence"
9341,"FOUR, back-to-back boundaries for batsman. Short ball down the leg side and batsman glances it past the fielder at short fine leg, off to a rocket start"
9342,out Caught by Rahul Chahar!! bowler could have conceded three boundaries in the over but luckily for him batsman picks out the fielder at short fine leg. The Sri Lankan had fired this one down the leg side and the Australian flicks it straight to the uncapped Indian at short fine leg. batsman can't believe his luck but such is cricket. He was dropped in the last game by Bairstow but not tonight. batsman c Rahul Chahar b bowler 8(4) [4s-2]
9343,"out Caught by Rahul Chahar!! Scuffed off the inside half, taken at long-on. He wasn't quite to the pitch while going for the loft, and hence the miscue. team struggling to get the spinners away. batsman c Rahul Chahar b bowler 5(8)"
9344,"out Caught by Suryakumar Yadav!! Has that been taken? They've gone upstairs to check, but it looks like a superb grab from Suryakumar. Soft signal is out. Short of length outside off, slower one, batsman mistimes the cut in front of backward point. Now then, Surya was diving forward there. Did he have his fingers underneath? The ball has bounced into his palm, but did it bounce off the fingertips, or the ground? Tough call with the replays that are available. Soft signal is out, so that may be telling. Or does the third umpire have enough evidence to overrule the soft signal? No he doesn't. OUT on the big screen. team dugout doesn't look too happy. But based on all evidence and the soft signal on the field, that's probably a fair call. batsman c Suryakumar Yadav b bowler 38(35) [4s-3 6s-1]"
9345,"FOUR, and batsman takes full toll of the free-hit. Slower ball from a back of a length, Bravo hangs back, stays leg-side of the ball and throws his bat at it to carve it over short third man"
9346,"FOUR, Chahar pulls his length back and Bravo has taken advantage of that. Sees it, rocks back and swivels to pull it through the gap between deep mid-wicket and long-on"
9347,"SIX, much-needed six for the hosts. Yet another off-pace ball. batsman saw that coming. Waits for this short ball to come to him and biffs the pull over deep mid-wicket"
9348,"out Caught&Bowled!! All the deliveries have been off-paced ones this over. Finally, it pays dividends for the Sri Lankan veteran. The cutter at 122kph and Bravo was early to close his bat-face. The ball popped up off the leading edge and bowler had to take a couple of steps backwards to gobble it up. batsman c and b bowler 20(17) [4s-2]"
9349,"out Caught by Krunal Pandya!! Krunal takes a good running catch! A seam-up short ball and batsman had to go after it. Looks to pull/heave it away and was a touch late on the shot. Gets it off the lower part of the bat. No timing, whatsoever. Krunal runs in from deep mid-wicket, keeps watching the ball, dives forward to complete a superb catch. batsman c Krunal Pandya b bowler 0(2)"
9350,"out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! Third wicket for bowler! The slower ball does the trick again. The cutter at 114.4kph, it was actually in the slot, but batsman couldn't generate enough power with his big-swing of the bat. Holes out at long-on. batsman c Hardik Pandya b bowler 1(3)"
9351,"SIX, too predictable! batsman knows that bowler will bowl a slower ball. The length was on the shorter side and it sat up nicely for the southpaw. batsman cleared his front leg and thumped it over long-on"
9352,"out Caught by Pollard!! A low full toss at 119kph, batsman goes for the lofted on-drive. Doesn't get the required elevation and Pollard takes a calm catch at long-on. Mumbai Indian win by 46 runs! batsman c Pollard b bowler 22(20) [6s-2]"
9353,"FOUR, that wasn't a well timed shot by batsman will take it. Short ball outside off, slow in place and batsman cuts it over point. That was in the air and as he played it over the infield, he managed to beat the fielders"
9354,"2 runs, blunder by Anukul Roy on debut, drops a sitter. batsman once again got deceived due to the slower delivery as he checked his shot. The ball ballooned towards backward point where the debutant fails to cling on to the catch. Nerves getting the better of him"
9355,"out Caught by Suryakumar Yadav!! That's a horrible shot by the team skipper! Swings hard at a short of a length delivery and miscues it completely. It's Suryakumar at backward point who takes the dolly, he ain't gonna drop those folks! Wicket on the first ball for Hardik, he got three against the same side at Wankhede a few weeks back. batsman c Suryakumar Yadav b bowler 2(4)"
9356,"FOUR, elegance personified! On the pads and batsman clips it with nonchalance over backward square leg. His best looking shot of the innings so far"
9357,"SIX, another effortless shot! Stands tall and lofts the length delivery right over the bowler's head for a half a dozen. Took one hand off the handle but the timing was just so fantastic"
9358,"out Bowled!! That last ball, which gripped, must've had a bearing in this dismissal. batsman, expecting some turn this time, plays outside the line of the ball which sneaks through and crashes into middle and leg. 99.1kph from bowler, just zipped through with the arm from round the wicket. batsman b bowler 0(3)"
9359,"FOUR, uppishly pulled in front of deep backward square where Krunal Pandya charges in for the catch. Tough to say whether it carried, probably didn't, and because all his efforts were directed at going for the catch, he's not able to save the boundary"
9360,"out Bowled!! Failed twice at the cut shot in the previous over from Chahar, and now Jadhav has perished to it. The line's too close to him this time as it skids in from round the wicket, absolutely no room to free the arms. Chops it back onto the stumps off the under-edge! bowler is having a ball out there. batsman b bowler 6(11)"
9361,"1 run, drills the full toss back at Roy who got both hands at it, but it was hit really hard and just burst through. Half a chance"
9362,"FOUR, batsman starts off in a stellar fashion. It was full and was curving away from batsman, he waits for the ball to deviate and guides it wide of cover for a boundary. He doesn't try to hit it too hard. Sweet timing!"
9363,"FOUR, touch quicker and bowler also gives width outside off, batsman stays low and plays the square drive really late, the timing was such that the fielder from sweeper couldn't get across to stop that"
9364,"FOUR, cheeky! Bravo goes short and outside off, batsman stands up and elevates it above the 'keeper. He just used the pace on the ball and pocketed a boundary"
9365,"out Caught by Dwayne Bravo!! Taken! That ball was in the air for quite some time but Bravo was calm and composed to gobble it up. batsman had to go after the left-arm spinner, he heaves it with all his might towards deep mid-wicket, but got more air time than distance. Bravo never looked in trouble while taking that. batsman c Dwayne Bravo b bowler 32(30) [4s-3 6s-1]"
9366,"1 run, fifty for batsman. First of the season and first in a long time. His last fifty also came against Chennai last year. He is set now and got the milestone out of the way, needs to launch to get Mumbai to a good total. He eases it wide of cover and calls for the single, there was a bit of confusion but they get it easily in the end"
9367,"out Caught by Santner!! bowler returns, bowler strikes. Krunal was sent to counter the left-arm spinner and the leg-spinner but he perishes while doing so. Flighted around off-stump, Krunal kneels down and slog sweeps, he didn't get it anywhere close to the middle and ends up offering a sitter to Santner at deep mid-wicket. batsman c Santner b bowler 1(3)"
9368,"FOUR, batsman looks at the base of his bat. A rank long hop and he cue-ends the pull towards deep mid-wicket, Shorey runs around the rope and dives over the ball. Poor effort from him"
9369,"FOUR, Shorey again can't get there. Quicker and attacking the stumps, batsman heaves it to cow corner - right between deep mid-wicket and long-on, Shorey runs to his left this time and can't stop the boundary"
9370,"SIX, ends bowler's spell with a maximum. Fraction short and batsman was quick to pick the length, he crouched a bit to get underneath the pull shot and sent it over a jumping Shorey at deep mid-wicket"
9371,"out Caught by Vijay! bowler is amidst a magnificent spell, choking the Mumbai batsmen with his spin. Tosses this one up around off and batsman has to stretch in order to reach out. Lifts the ball high up in the air but fails in his quest to the clear the long-on boundary. Tired looking shot by the skipper but he's laid the foundation. Hopefully, Pollard and Pandya finish it off in style. They need to play out bowler first. batsman c Vijay b bowler 67(48) [4s-6 6s-3]"
9372,"FOUR, first one of the innings for batsman. Finally gets one right. Wasn't middled though! Short of a length delivery that kept a touch low, KP swung hard at it and got an inside edge that rolled past the man at short fine leg. The fielder in the deep was very square too, hence he couldn't quite get there"
9373,"FOUR, that's hammered! Right into the slot and the big arms take over. KP gets underneath it and smashes it over the bowler's head. Luckily there was some elevation, else Bravo's head could have been in trouble"
9374,"FOUR, that's a short-arm jab. A full toss on off and Pandya's strong bottom hand does all the talking. Short-arm jabs over Pollard who was ducking for cover. Pressure back on Bravo!"
9375,"SIX, 150 up for Mumbai and that too in style. Pandya latches on to the slower delivery, right into the slot and it's been muscled over the long-on fence, huge six"
9376,"SIX, de kock continues his terrific form in this IPL. It was a back of a length delivery on the stumps, not that short from bowler. But batsman identifies the length early, gets in a terrific position and powers the pull shot over deep square leg for a maximum"
9377,"FOUR, 10 off 2 in this over. bowler has been belted for the first time in powerplay. He is clearly not used to it. And his response will be interesting to see. It was touch fuller of good length, batsman picks up the length early and drives it like a boss. It beats cover and races to the fence"
9378,"out Caught by Rayudu!! He was put under pressure by batsman in this over and he has responded in the best possible fashion with a wicket. Quality of a champion bowler. It was a well-disguised slower delivery, batsman was totally taken aback by it. His bat swing came down much much early, it clipped his top-edge and went straight up in the air. Rayudu with the gloves takes it with ease. And bowler picks up his mandatory wicket with the new cherry. batsman c Rayudu b bowler 15(9) [4s-1 6s-1]"
9379,"FOUR, batsman has controlled that shot brilliantly and it will fetch him four. It was slower down the leg-side, batsman picks it up early, waits for it to arrive, gets on top of it and half-pulls it wide of fine leg for a boundary"
9380,"FOUR, edged and four! Streaky but batsman would take it. It was on a good length and was wide of off, batsman wanted to drive it away from the body. He plays down the wrong line and inside edge takes it wide of stumps and into the fence"
9381,"FOUR, four to finish the over. He has placed it brilliantly. It was short and was on the body, batsman swivels and pulls it wide of short fine for a boundary"
9382,"SIX, has he cleared the fence, yes he has! Only just though! It was a flighted delivery, batsman dashes down to come close to the ball, bowler drags his length back. And batsman was not even close to the pitch he still goes through with the shot. And his audacity prevails as it clears deep mid-wicket"
9383,"SIX, cleared the boundary with utmost ease this time. He looks in his elements today. Again, charges down the ground, wasn't to the pitch but he swings his willow hard and gets enough bat on it to pump it over long-on"
9384,"SIX, smashed! bowler errs by landing it in the arc and batsman sends it straight back over him. Overpitched and the extension of the arms is enough to take it all the way over the boundary rope"
9385,"FOUR, and again.. But not as well timed as the previous one. Flighted on a fullish length, batsman lofts it straight back over bowler and the ball bounces just inside the rope before beating the long-on fielder"
9386,"FOUR, pinged off the middle! batsman starting from where he left off in his previous game in Jaipur. Waits for the length delivery to swing in and presents full face of the bat and massages the drive through extra cover. Sheer timing!!"
9387,"SIX, magical timing from batsman! A length ball outside off, and this is barely an extension of an off-drive but he's struck it so sweetly. It's gone all the way. Class!"
9388,"out Caught by Warner!! batsman throws his head back in disappointment as Warner completes the catch at long-off. He wanted to drive this much wider of him after giving himself some room. But couldn't open the face enough on contact. The timing is sweet, which is what brings Warner into play as it carries all the way to him. batsman c Warner b bowler 39(34) [4s-4 6s-1]"
9389,"FOUR, this time he goes much wider of long-on for a boundary. Nice use of the feet which takes him close enough to the ball that he can confidently whip his wrists against the turn. Good start from batsman"
9390,"FOUR, just look at the timing and placement on that shot! Making batting look so effortless. Kaul continues to leak boundaries. Goes wide this time around and batsman slices it past the fielder at point. The fielder in the deep sprinted across to his left but couldn't stop it from finding the fence"
9391,"FOUR, another sublime shot! Tad short in length and batsman picks it with nonchalance over square leg. Again there was a fielder charging towards his right in the deep but the placement was just so perfect and the dive had no effect in the end result"
9392,"2 runs, one of safest fielders has put down a catch now! Not a great day for team and Rashid's dropped catch sums up Hyderabad's day. batsman had hacked the short ball to deep mid-wicket where the Afghan leggie sprinted in, got his hands to it but couldn't quite cling on to it"
9393,"FOUR, easy pickings! Short ball and down the leg side, around the hip and all batsman had to do is get some bat on it. Glances it very fine and the fielder in the deep was way too square to cut this down"
9394,"FOUR, stand and deliver! Everyone's admiring the shot including the bowler. Tad short in length and batsman bludgeons it over mid-wicket. Almost went the distance such was the timing"
9395,"FOUR, 50-run stand up for the third wicket but Samson has done majority of the scoring! batsman had flicked it to fine leg where Kaul slides to stop the ball. When he releases the ball to throw it, the fielder is in contact with the ropes. Nothing going team's way, nothing!"
9396,out Caught by S Kaul!! Khaleel ends his spell with a wicket. Cramps up the batsman with a short ball and batsman takes one hand off his bat as he looks to pull it away. The timing wasn't great as he miscued it to fine leg. Kaul was the man in the deep who almost made a mess of it. batsman has done his job though as his team is within touching distance of an emphatic win. batsman c S Kaul b bowler 22(16) [4s-3]
9397,"FOUR, batsman hits the winning boundary! Treks back and drags the short ball into the gap at cow corner. No fielders in the deep and Rajasthan Royals beat Sunrisers Hyderabad by 7 wickets to spice up the points table"
9398,"FOUR, gets a full delivery on the stumps, batsman picks the field change (long-on moved to mid-on for this delivery) and whips it with flair over the ring on the leg-side"
9399,"FOUR, looks to follow batsman and spills a half-volley on the pads, batsman brings his bottom hand into play by whipping it powerfully wide of the fielder at deep square"
9400,"SIX, too full on off-stump, batsman picks the flight and sits on one knee to dispatch it for a 75-metre maximum over mid-wicket"
9401,"SIX, batsman joins the party now! Sees Rashid flight the googly, gets as low as he can and smokes it into the cow corner stands for a crisp maximum"
9402,"FOUR, makes room to open up the off-side, slashes hard and gets lucky with a thick top-edge that flies over short third man"
9403,"FOUR, short of length around off, batsman pulls it gleefully past short fine leg. Nothing ball from Siddarth Kaul"
9404,"SIX, another knuckle ball, and this one's been picked alright! batsman smokes it over deep midwicket. Fifty up for the Royals in just the sixth over"
9405,"FOUR, back of a length on middle, batsman clears the front leg and mows it over mid-on. He's taken a liking to Kaul"
9406,"SIX, batsman can't help but burst out laughing. Outrageous shot. Short ball around shoulder height, and he's forehanded this swat right back over the bowler's head for six"
9407,"no run, Very fancy shot to attempt off someone like Rashid who fizzes the ball through. But the impact is probably just outside off which has saved him. team aren't convinced with the umpire's call, so they go for a review. Only to waste it. Flat leg-break just outside off, batsman wanted to scoop it over the keeper's head, but wasn't able to connect"
9408,"FOUR, rocks back to this short ball and thumps it through square leg. Rollicking entry into the season from batsman"
9409,"FOUR, hammers it down the ground. Brute power from batsman, who was nowhere near the pitch of it after stepping out. But the slowness of the surface allowed him to adjust before he brought the sledgehammer down and smashed it"
9410,"out Caught by Saha!! Flat leg-break turning away from off, batsman looks to whip it through the on-side but only manages an inside-edge which is taken smartly by Saha. He did have a word with Rahane about the review, may not have been entirely sure, but was happy to keep walking after getting little encouragement. Definite edge. Respite for the Sunrisers. batsman c Saha b bowler 44(26) [4s-4 6s-3]"
9411,"FOUR, Rajasthan having a torrid time in the field. Aaron now concedes a boundary. Fraction short and outside off, batsman backs cuts it to third man and Aaron lets it escape right through his legs. That is now 10 runs given away for free"
9412,"FOUR, overpitched delivery at 124.6kph, batsman hammers it straight down the ground after walking down the tarck. It went between the umpire and Warner"
9413,"1 run, drilled back to the bowler, who parries towards extra cover and that allows batsman to take the single. Back-to-back fifties for Pandey! He certainly likes to bat at No. 3!"
9414,"out Caught by Smith!! Smith has pulled off a stunner! And, batsman can't register his sixth successive fifty. A pacy short of length delivery from bowler and batsman had backed away to slap it away. A hint of extra bounce and hence batsman couldn't time it as well as he would liked it to. The ball ballooned up and Smith ran back and to his right from mid-off before putting a full-stretched dive. He kept his eyes on the ball and completed a superb catch. Snaffled it with both hands and ensured that the ball didn't pop out when his elbows made contact with the ground. A much-needed breakthrough for the hosts. batsman c Smith b bowler 37(32)"
9415,"1 run, taps a length ball to short cover and sets off for a risky single. Parag fails to hit the target at the striker's end"
9416,"FOUR, shot! Brilliant use of the crease. It was the quick ball - 113.4kph - batsman made room and lifted it inside-out over extra cover for a one-bounce four"
9417,"out Caught!! Well, Gopal was not sure why the third umpire was called. In the end, he has the wicket of his fellow state-mate. It was the googly and batsman was cramped for room. He was looking to guide it to third man and it went off the face of the bat. Samson caught it and then dislodged the bails. Wierdly, the keeper didn't appeal for caught-behind. The TV umpire was called for a stumping appeal and Pandey's back leg was in the air. He was out twice and I reckon the dismissal will be changed to caught! batsman c Samson b bowler 61(36) [4s-9]"
9418,"out Caught by Unadkat!! team are falling apart here. A short ball at 130.5kph - the off-cutter, batsman didn't pick it and was early into his shot - the pull/heave. Got it off the cue end. Unadkat ran in from deep backward square leg and took a sharp low catch. batsman c Unadkat b bowler 8(10)"
9419,"1 run, dropped! Short ball angled around the ribcage, batsman was cramped for room and despite that he decided to go for the pull, sends it off the thick top-edge and Varun Aaron can't hold on at short fine. He dived to his left but couldn't gather the ball cleanly"
9420,"out Caught&Bowled!! bowler is on fire!! He has managed to hold on to a one-handed specky. Bowled a loopy full ball on off-stump and batsman clearly didn't pick the change of pace on that, just checked his push and chipped it straight in the air towards the bowler. bowler had to control his momentum, leap up to his full height and grab it one-handed mid air. batsman c and b bowler 0(1)"
9421,"2 runs, dropped! batsman was in two minds, got stuck inside the crease and played a freaky scoop-pull against the skiddy short ball, it hung in the air for an eternity and Shreyas Gopal - despite covering good few yards to his right - at fine leg spills it off his palms"
9422,"out Caught by Samson!! Ah, this is more conventional and straightforward. Bowls a pacy short ball and keeps it straight on the stumps, batsman came charging down the pitch and the extra bounce was always going to create trouble. As expected, the short ball got slightly big on him and he feathered a thin edge straight to Samson behind the stumps. batsman c Samson b bowler 5(5)"
9423,"out Caught by Shreyas Gopal!! bowler roaring back into this game in some style. Bowls the slower ball and hits the pitch hard while doing so, it sat up nicely for batsman outside off but lack of pace means he had to power it really hard off the middle. batsman seemed to have found the middle but couldn't manage the desired distance as Gopal takes a fine running catch at long-on (to his left). batsman c Shreyas Gopal b bowler 9(10)"
9424,"byes, FOUR, bowls the slower short ball on the stumps, Bhuvi misses on the ramp and a hint of deviation after pitching meant Samson couldn't control the pace despite the dive to his left"
9425,"out Caught by Unadkat!! Excellent running catch from Unadkat. Ran all the way from short fine and caught this around the backward square area with a splendid dive. Bhuvi just chipped a back of the hand slower ball without any conviction and then the theatrics from Unadkat, the fielder. batsman c Unadkat b bowler 1(4)"
9426,"FOUR, very full delivery outside off, Rashid set himself inside the crease and cleared his front leg while doing so, just pumped it over extra cover with disdain"
9427,"FOUR, batsman at his best. Pitched up outside off, no movement and batsman creams the square drive past the diving cover-point fielder. No chance of stopping that"
9428,"SIX, another slower ball and batsman has nailed this for a maximum. Moved back and across, waited for it arrive and smashed it flat and straight over mid-off, it crashed straight into the boundary hoardings"
9429,"out Bowled!! Cleaned up! Gopal adds batsman to his prodigious list. The googly and batsman did not pick it, he stayed rooted to the crease and tried to read it off the surface, too late. The ball spun back in hit the front pad before ricocheting onto the stumps. A much needed wicket after a sloppy start. batsman b bowler 13(14) [4s-2]"
9430,"FOUR, this is a shot of a man in confidence. He picked the wrong 'un that was a tad overpitched and lofted it straight of mid-off, superb way to open your account"
9431,"FOUR, Pandey already looks in his element. Slower short of length delivery and Pandey picked the length so early, short-arm jabs the pull over mid-wicket and it almost went the distance"
9432,"FOUR, Pandey hitting through the off-side tells you he is in form. Short and just outside off, Pandey makes his own room and slaps it through the crowded off-side field"
9433,"FOUR, nicely done. Gopal errs on the shorter side and Pandey threads the gap behind point with a delicate cut shot. He played it late and that enabled him to bisect backward point and short third man"
9434,"FOUR, Pandey is winning this battle against his state mate. Once again he picks the length so early, swivels deep in the crease and pulls to deep mid-wicket, beating the fielder comfortably to his right"
9435,"FOUR, batsman goes downtown! bowler slightly overpitches and the Karnataka lad takes full toll of it. Right in the slot and Pandey thumps it over the bowler's head"
9436,"FOUR, fifty partnership! Parag over-corrects and bowls this too short, easy pickings for batsman. Pulled away through mid-wicket for yet another boundary"
9437,"FOUR, batsman opens his account in style. Just one sighter required for the lefty. Umesh went a tad full, batsman shimmied down the track and flayed it over cover-point. Raced away"
9438,"FOUR, positive stroke! He doesn't want the spinner to settle in here. Gives the charge by coming down the track, wasn't anyhwere close to the pitch of the ball, but with a big swing of the bat he smashed it over the bowler's head for a one-bounce four"
9439,"FOUR, back-to-back fours! A quick non-turner wide of off, Shaw stays back in the crease and scythes it hard and wide of backward point"
9440,"FOUR, ohh! Shikhar, you cheeky, cheeky fellow. He shuffles well wide of off, bowler bowls it in his area. And it was on a fuller length, the length and line was ideal for batsman to scoop it over short fine for a boundary"
9441,"1 run, brings up his fifty now! Wanted to sweep it to the on-side, gets an inside edge. And it hits his pads and deflects to the off-side, good enough for a single. Third consecutive fifty for Shikhar. After an average start to the tournament, he has lifted his form brilliantly for the team"
9442,"out Caught by Washington Sundar!! batsman perishes after reaching his fifty. Boy! team needed that badly. bowler as he ususally does for team, gets the wicket in the middle overs. batsman premeditates the sweep shot, bowler saw that and he is astute enough to drag his length back and bowled well wide of off. It clipped his top-edge and Sundar takes a dolly at short fine leg. batsman has done his job though, over to Pant and Iyer now. batsman c Washington Sundar b bowler 50(37) [4s-5 6s-2]"
9443,"FOUR, you cannot bowl short to batsman, you just cannot. bowler does the mistake and gets belted for a boundary. He picked up the length early crouched low and powers the pull shot wide of deep mid-wicket for a boundary"
9444,"SIX, top-shot! Dashes down, wasn't entirely to the pitch of it but decides to go with a big hit and gets enough bat behind it to deposit it into the stands. He played it against the spin, mind you! It needs some skill"
9445,"SIX, reaches his fifty in style! Comes down the track again and launches it over deep mid-wicket for a mighty six. It has been a terrific innings from the skipper!"
9446,"out Lbw!! Whatta comeback from bowler. After being clobbered for two sixes, he has come back with the vital wicket of batsman. It was a leggie which spins into batsman, he wanted to work it to the leg-side, plays down the wrong line. It misses his edge and raps him on the pads. It looked close and umpire gave him out instantly. Rishabh challenged the decision but was proved wrong within minutes. batsman lbw b bowler 7(7) [4s-1]"
9447,"out Caught by Kohli!! Spinners are doing the trick for team in the middle overs. batsman wanted to smash it into the crowd again, bowler realized that and bowled it a little slower. It gripped in the surface. The spin on the delivery forced batsman to mistime it and he ends up finding Kohli at deep mid-wicket. batsman c Kohli b bowler 52(37) [4s-2 6s-3]"
9448,"FOUR, belted! This time he connects and boy doesn't he pack a punch. Good length ball outside off, batsman shuffles across and pumps it straight back over Saini, one bounce and over the ropes"
9449,"SIX, woah! This is even better. Saini went for the change of pace and batsman spotted it, he made room and waited to play the inside out loft, sent it just over the deep extra cover fence"
9450,"out Caught by Washington Sundar!! Gone! Saini wins the final battle. Struck for a four and a six and the local boy responds with the wicket of batsman. Very big moment at this stage. Slower ball that is dragged back on seeing batsman move across his stumps, the scoop lacks power or pace and Sundar completes a dolly near short fine leg. batsman c Washington Sundar b bowler 11(7) [4s-1 6s-1]"
9451,"SIX, smashed! batsman keeps the boundaries coming for Delhi. He picked the back of a length delivery quickly, got into position and swatted the pull over deep mid-wicket. Clean strike"
9452,"FOUR, freebie and batsman helps himself to a boundary. Short and around hip height, he swivels and pulls it over short fine. Just used the pace of Umesh to fetch a one bounce four"
9453,"SIX, he only deals in sixes by the looks of it. Length delivery right in the slot for batsman, he clears his front leg and smokes it into the Delhi dugout near cow corner. Iyer liked it in the dressing room"
9454,"FOUR, 16 runs off the over and just what Delhi wanted. Umesh goes for the off-cutter, but he bowls it short and outside off, batsman slaps the punch through extra cover and Dube has no chance running across from sweeper cover"
9455,"byes, FOUR, high full toss outside off and batsman can't put bat on it. Poor Parthiv Patel has no chance as the ball bounces in front of him and races away to the fence. batsman asks for a possible no-ball but gets nothing from the umpires. It was around waist high and might have been given on another day"
9456,"FOUR, edged and four! This is where Saini needs to learn. He bowls a pacy yorker outside off and batsman squirts an outside edge past Parthiv Patel. He has to take pace off on this slower surface"
9457,"FOUR, these runs will be hurting Bangalore. Saini is just spearing them in and missing the yorkers, another full toss and batsman looks to heave it to the leg-side, the leading edge balloons over short third man"
9458,"SIX, batsman greets the new bowler with a maximum! A floaty delivery from bowler, batsman waltzes down the pitch, gets close to the ball and pumps it downtown. The sightscreen has to bear the brunt"
9459,"FOUR, bad ball and rightly put away by batsman. A drag down by bowler and the line is down leg, batsman moves off-side, gets low and helps it on its way with a pull over short fine leg"
9460,"SIX, Kohli walks away in frustration. 20 runs off the final over and make it 36 off the last two. Another full toss outside off, batsman slices it over point and the short square boundaries help get maximum result"
9461,"FOUR, now batsman gets into the act. bowler overpitches, Shaw gets down on a knee and flogs it over mid-on. Clean strike for a one-bounce four. 15 runs off the over!"
9462,"FOUR, that's a trademark batsman shot! Not a bad ball from Umesh Yadav, he bowled a length delivery around off. Shaw stayed put in his crease and punched it fiercely through point. Got it off the meat of the bat"
9463,"out Caught by Parthiv Patel!! Edged and gone! Oh, wait PP is down on his feet and the umpires decide to go upstairs. The soft signal is OUT! It's been grabbed by the keeper and batsman has to walk back. Parthiv got hit on the chest before snaffling it with his mitts. It would have definitely pained and hence he went down. Coming to the ball, it was a back of a length delivery wide of off. Shaw stayed in his crease and went for the cut shot. A hint of extra bounce and that induced the edge. batsman c Parthiv Patel b bowler 18(10) [4s-4]"
9464,"FOUR, cross-seam ball - shortish and wide outside off. batsman, like Shaw, goes for the cut. But, fortunately for him, the ball went through the vacant slip region. The skipper gets off the mark in a streaky manner"
9465,"SIX, a hit-me delivery first up from Saini. A leg-stump half-volley at 141.2kph. Easy pickings for the southpaw. The Indian opener flicks it nonchalantly over long leg for half a dozen"
9466,"FOUR, 50 up for Delhi! A brilliant shot from the skipper. A fullish ball at 140.9kph, batsman stayed in his crease and brought his down at the right time to knock it through the gap between mid-on and mid-wicket. Superb timing"
9467,"FOUR, hammered! Fuller ball at 143.6kph, batsman dances down the track and biffs it down the ground - finding the gap between the umpire and Shreyas Iyer. There's no one to stop that"
9468,"1 run, once again batsman steps out of his crease, this time to play an uppish drive. Made decent connection, but luckily it falls short of a forward-diving mid-off fielder"
9469,"SIX, a biggie! Not a good ball, drifts one on the pads does bowler. batsman gets forward to take his front leg out of the equation and hoists it over cow corner"
9470,"FOUR, another short of length delivery, it was at comfortable hip-height for batsman who gets in a good position and dispatches it wide of deep square leg for a boundary"
9471,"1 run, batsman cuts it wide of backward point for a single and 50-run partnership comes up."
9472,"FOUR, swings one way the ball goes completely in the opposite direction. Parthiv wanted to hack to the leg-side but the thick outside edge flies over and wide of Pant"
9473,"FOUR, much more like it. That is his strength. Anything slightly full and outside off, Parthiv just frees his arms and lofts it straight back over the bowler, one bounce and over the rope"
9474,"SIX, deposited into the crowd. Parthiv moves across a bit, gets inside the line and swings it with the spin over backward square leg. Made decent connection as the ball sailed 20 rows back"
9475,"SIX, cracking shot, that spoils the over for bowler, fraction too short and Dube is quick to latch onto it - rocks back and pulls it high and over mid-wicket for a maximum"
9476,"out Caught by Axar!! Has this sealed the match for team? A superb running catch at deep mid-wicket and yet another long hop has got them a wicket - this was short and AB rocked back on the pull, don't think he hit it all that well - Axar ran across from the deep, kept his eyes on the ball and then latched onto a fine overhead catch. He then had to make sure that he didn't step onto the ropes, which he did. The third umpire has a look and sends AB on his way. The equation has just got tougher for the men in red. batsman c Axar b bowler 17(19) [6s-1]"
9477,"out Caught by Pant!! Pant takes a blinder to get rid of batsman. The South African was looking play the scoop but makes a mess of it eventually. The ball catches the cue end, deflects on to his helmet grille and lobs to the left of the keeper. Pant charges to his left, puts in a dive and pulls off a stunning catch to bring an end to batsman's short stay at the crease. batsman c Pant b bowler 3(3)"
9478,out Caught by Dhawan!! team sink further as Dube departs. Fails to read the googly and swings across. As a result of the wrong 'un a thick leading edge is induced and Dhawan at cover-point takes a well judged catch. Looked good for his knock of 24 but the onus will now be on Stoinis to brave the visitors out of trouble. Can he? batsman c Dhawan b bowler 24(16) [6s-2]
9479,"FOUR, chants of 'team, team' as soon as batsman thumps this one down the ground. Reaches out for the tossed up delivery and lofts it straight over the bowler's head for a clean boundary"
9480,"SIX, just look at the power of this man. A flighted delivery around off, batsman gets hold of it and tonks it right over the bowler's head for a towering six. Massive, believe you me"
9481,"FOUR, boundary to start proceedings in the final phase of the match. Positive intent by batsman. Eyes the deep square leg fence and drags the short ball away nicely. The fielder inside the circle was a touch too square and the fielder in the deep was very fine, right into the gap and that shall be four runs"
9482,"SIX, that's hit the boundary cushions on the full. Was a back of a length delivery and batsman heaved it over deep mid-wicket for a flat six. Where was this man all these games? Playing his first game of the season and making an impact right away"
9483,"FOUR, fortune favours the brave, they say. Back of a length delivery around off, Gurkeerat is a touch early as he swings across the line but the top-edge is enough to fetch him four more, with the fielder inside the circle at third man, this was bound to happen"
9484,"out Caught by Pant!! Edged and taken! Full and wide outside off, Gurkeerat goes hard at it and gets an outside edge to the keeper. Quality over by bowler so far. Things getting tougher with every delivery for team. batsman c Pant b bowler 27(19) [4s-2 6s-1]"
9485,"out Caught by Shreyas Iyer!! Delhi Capitals inch closer to booking a place in the play-offs. bowler bowls a slower delivery on middle and leg, Sundar looks to go big and gets deceived due to the slower delivery. Mistimes his loft to long-on and Iyer completes the formalities. batsman c Shreyas Iyer b bowler 1(2)"
9486,"SIX, dispatched with disdain! It's too late though. batsman latches on to the short ball and smokes it over deep mid-wicket for a flat six"
9487,"FOUR, bowler is welcomed with a boundary to the attack. The googly lands outside leg and Parthiv swings it away over square leg, just bounces inside the rope"
9488,"FOUR, he's just toyed with the bowler. The fielder was moved squarer after the first boundary but this time Parthiv goes straighter with his whip, another one bounce four"
9489,"FOUR, this is the best of the lot. Googly around leg-stump, Parthiv flicks it against the spin to deep mid-wicket. He played it all along the ground and still managed to beat the fielder"
9490,"FOUR, geez! That is some shot. Pitched up outside off, Parthiv doesn't move his feet much but just drives through the line, the weight going back and the hands moving towards the ball. Nobody moved in the field as the ball rocketed past mid-off"
9491,"FOUR, batsman joins in. It was only a matter of time. This is a top shot. Good length ball around off, batsman drives on the rise and over Parthiv at the other end. He almost cleaned him up"
9492,"SIX, lovely, this is adding insult to injury - length ball outside off, batsman leans forward and lifts it high and over long-on - went sailing over the ropes for a maximum"
9493,"FOUR, this is what pressure does - a fumble from Rabada and he concedes three extra runs to batsman - on a good length and at the stumps, batsman nudged it in front of mid-on and charged across for a quick single - so did Rabada and he took his eyes off the ball, slipped underneath and rolled away to the fence"
9494,"FOUR, cracking shot, change of pace from bowler, it was the slower ball, but it was well wide of off, Parthiv leant forward and cracked the drive wide of mid-off, no need to run for those"
9495,"out Caught by Axar!! A smart catch from Axar at backward point and bowler can afford a smile now - much needed wicket for the Capitals - this was short and well wide of off, Parthiv made room and crunched the cut - didn't keep it down and didn't find the gap, straight to Axar who does well to hold on. Parthiv has done his job, but he will be disappointed at having thrown another start away. batsman c Axar b bowler 39(20) [4s-7 6s-1]"
9496,"out Caught by Rutherford!! Oh dear! That's a killer blow for team, batsman has pulled a half-tracker into the hands of Rutherford at deep mid-wicket. He looks gutted and all of a sudden, team have lost two quick wickets. It was dropped short and at the stumps, batsman rocked back on the pull, but he couldn't have placed the shot any more perfectly for the hosts - straight into the big hands of the West Indian. batsman c Rutherford b bowler 23(17) [4s-2 6s-1]"
9497,"2 runs, a skier and Tewatia has made a mess of it, another wrong 'un from bowler, slower and spinning across the left-hander, Dube was in no position on the big slog, gets a thick leading edge, high and wide of long-on. Tewatia had plenty of time as he got across, too close to the ball and it bounced out"
9498,"SIX, that should get AB going, a rank long hop, short and down the leg-side, AB swivels across and pulls it high and deep into the stands at backward square leg"
9499,"SIX, smashed, tossed up well wide of off, Dube leans across and drags the slog-sweep, didn't get hold of the shot, but has enough to clear the fielder at long-on"
9500,"FOUR, brilliant start for the young batsman and team. It was on a fuller length and was on the stumps, batsman uses his wrists to perfection and flicks it wide of mid-wicket for a boundary. Outfield is lighting quick!"
9501,"FOUR, wow! This man, whatta talent. Nothing wrong with the delivery, it was on a length and around off, batsman jumps in the crease a touch, waits for it to arrive and punches it in the most amazing fashion for a boundary through cover"
9502,"SIX, dispatched for a six! Stellar stuff from batsman. It was touch short and was on the body, batsman identifies the length in a canter, gets in a brilliant position and powers it over deep square leg for a maximum. team are off to a flier!"
9503,"FOUR, lovely, but that was a bad misfield from the man at cover - on a good length and well outside off, Shubman leant into the drive and found cover - who let the ball go through"
9504,"1 run, fifty for Shubman, his second of the tournament, change of pace from bowler, slower ball outside off, dabbed down towards third man for a single"
9505,"FOUR, was it a chance? Lewis charged forward, nearly got down, dived forward and got a hand - but the ball was always dropping in front of him - can't get his body behind either and concedes a boundary"
9506,"SIX, beautiful, just a lovely extension of his arms, Shubman came down the track, got close to the ball and then let his hands take over - sent it sailing over long-on for a maximum"
9507,"SIX, clubbed, the leg-break and Shubman spotted it, gets a good stride forward and heaves it wide of long-on"
9508,"SIX, too full from Chahar, Russell gets under it and smashes it high and over mid-wicket - his first of the night"
9509,"SIX, back-to-back sixes for Russell - after a slow start, he's got the move alright. Tad too full from Chahar, right in Russell's hitting arc, he gets down low and pummels it high and over mid-wicket"
9510,"FOUR, drilled, length ball outside off and Shubman drilled it back at the bowler - was a chance but bowler had little time to react, raced away across the fast outfield"
9511,"FOUR, too full and too straight from bowler, on Shubman's pads and his neat little flick is good to get past the diving short fine fielder"
9512,"FOUR, slapped, on a good length and well outside off, Russell threw his bat at that, off the toe-end and races past third man - who was inside the ring. Even bowler is leaking runs"
9513,"out Caught by Lewis!! For a moment, Shubman seemed to have got hold of the shot - but he got plenty of height but not the distance, good catch at deep mid-wicket from Lewis - backtracking as he was, it was the slower ball and that did Shubman in, had to drag his shot and didn't get the requisite power behind it. Walks off to a standing ovation and after the customary check for a possible front-foot no-ball. batsman c Lewis b bowler 76(45) [4s-6 6s-4]"
9514,"FOUR, cheeky and four, banged in short and wide as Russell was backing away - he waits on the ball and then ramps it over short third man, almost went all the way, bounced just in front of the ropes"
9515,"FOUR, slower ball at 118.7kph, but batsman picked that. It was shorter in length and the skipper had ample time to pick his spot. Stayed back and pummelled the pull over mid-wicket for a one-bounce four"
9516,"SIX, even better! A normal-paced ball at 141kph from a short of length, batsman picks the length early, stays in the crease and hammers it over deep mid-wicket with a powerful pull shot"
9517,"SIX, another slower ball - 117.2kph, shorter in length and sits up nicely for the big West Indian to swing his bat. Russell clears his front leg and heaves it over deep mid-wicket. A biggie"
9518,"SIX, six more! A high full toss, Russell moves leg-side and clubs it over cow corner. Missed the yorker by a long way. Brute power!"
9519,"SIX, that's an incredible hit! bowler shortens his length and there wasn't too much width either. Russell made room and slapped it over square third man. He managed to slice it all the way for a six"
9520,"1 run, 146.1kph, another in-angling yorker, Russell moves leg-side and knocks it to long-on. Eighth IPL fifty for Dre Russ! Raises his bat and points it towards his team's dugout"
9521,"FOUR, 145.2kph, in-slanting short of length delivery, Russell moves leg-side and pulls hard. Didn't quite get it off the middle, but that's the power of this man. Races away to the deep mid-wicket fence in a jiffy"
9522,"SIX, wow! This is tremendous. It was a slower delivery outside off and Russell had to reach out a long way as he was initaially backing away. He lost his balance, but that didn't stop him from smashing a flat six over sweeper cover"
9523,"SIX, six to start the over! bowler bowls one right in the slot - pace on offer as well, Russell stays deep in the crease, crouches low and flogs it over deep mid-wicket"
9524,"FOUR, 131.2kph, full and wide of off, bowler misses his yorker though. Loads of width and Russell got down on a knee to batter it through the covers"
9525,"FOUR, ah! You gotta feel for the bowler here. A yorker length ball wide of off and Russell threw the kitchen sink at it. Gets a big under edge that hits the ground and lobs over the keeper's head"
9526,"SIX, Russell finishes it off with a six! Not a single off-paced delivery in this over. Overpitched delivery and the West Indian doesn't need second invitations to put it away. Stays deep in the crease, bends his back leg and clubs it over wide long-off. team finish on 232 - highest score of the season"
9527,"FOUR, batsman finally dispatches one against bowler. It was a very full delivery and was on the stumps, batsman backs away and squeezes the drive wide of cover for a boundary"
9528,"FOUR, enough bat on it to clear the man at short fine. batsman goes down on his knees on that delivery on the stumps and slog sweeps it over short fine for a boundary"
9529,"FOUR, batsman swings and swings hard at it. He wanted to drive it through cover, it hits the inside half of the blade and goes wide of square leg for a boundary"
9530,"no run, Pollard drops it! It was an off-cutter on a back of a length, batsman wanted to clear mid-off but he mistimed it badly. Pollard at mid-off dives dramatically to his right but fails to time his dive to perfection and ends up spilling it"
9531,"FOUR, errs in line this time and batsman won't spare him. He gets in a good position and times his nudge to perfection. The outfield at Eden is a highway and it will run away for a boundary through fine leg"
9532,"FOUR, four to finish the over. And partnership between the pair is 50 now. It was a back of a length delivery around off, batsman waits for it to arrive and tonks it really hard over mid-off for a boundary"
9533,"FOUR, makes room, creates the room for himself and smashes it wide of mid-off for a boundary"
9534,"SIX, deposited this into the stands. Lynn means business today. It was a wrong 'un, batsman reads it late but gets himself in terrific position and launches it over deep mid-wicket for a maximum"
9535,"FOUR, he is hitting it really well. Again, moves away, creates room and clobbers it wide of long-off. Pollard ran to his left but fails to get there"
9536,"SIX, into the stands! Lynnsanity at the Eden today! It was fuller and on the stumps, batsman gets under it and larrups it over deep mid-wicket for a mighty six"
9537,"FOUR, he's in some mood tonight - tad too full and well wide of off, Lynn gets underneath it and then scoops it over extra-cover, one bounce and over the ropes"
9538,"1 run, the slower loopy full-toss from Sran, would have been called as a wide had he let it go, went chasing and chips it wide of cover-point, raises a 27-ball half-century"
9539,"FOUR, hammered, he's having a ball tonight, length ball at the stumps, Lynn clears his left leg and shovels it wide of long-on, no need to run for those"
9540,"SIX, beautifully played, the leg-break from Chahar, Shubman gets a good stride forward, opens the face of the bat at the last moment and lifts it majestically over cover, went sailing over the ropes for a maximum - team making a statement with the bat and the ball has been lost in the crowd"
9541,"out Caught by Lewis!! Chahar and his funky bowling action has the better of Lynn - this was the leg-break, pitched outside leg and spun across the right-hander, Lynn opened himself up for the big slog, got underneath the delivery, ended up slicing it high and towards wide long-on. Lewis kept his eys on the ball and takes a reverse-cupped catch. batsman c Lewis b bowler 54(29) [4s-8 6s-2]"
9542,"FOUR, batsman gets off the mark with a boundary! Opens his bat-face at the last moment and steers this away-swinging length ball wide of the slip fielder. Neatly done"
9543,"FOUR, nine runs off the opening over! A harmless short ball on leg-stump line, rises up to the hip and that's easy pickings for the Mumbai captain. batsman plays a one-legged pull shot over backward square leg for a one-bounce four"
9544,out Caught by A Russell!! batsman goes back without troubling the scorers. bowler was amongst the wickets in the previous match. Gets rid of the dangerous opener in his very first over. It was the carrom-ball from bowler that went through with the anlge (over the wicket). batsman went for the sweep and only managed a top edge. Russell comes in from deep backward square leg to snaffle it with ease. batsman c A Russell b bowler 0(4)
9545,"FOUR, once again, batsman steps out of his crease, this time he manages to get under it and club it over wide mid-on for a boundary"
9546,"FOUR, this is the battle to watch out for. Off-break drifts on the legs and batsman picks it away effortlessly in front of square on the leg-side, just bounced inside the rope"
9547,"SIX, Pandya slowly giving Mumbai the push. He picks the off-break, shuffles across and heaves it with the spin over deep mid-wicket. Struck it flat and got the distance"
9548,"SIX, round the wicket angle is not working, for now. Fraction short and Pandya is quick to pounce on it, he stays deep in the crease and smashes it a good 20 rows back"
9549,"SIX, Pandya is going down with a fight. Short and down leg, Pandya waits before swiveling across and pulling it over long leg. Another huge one from the allrounder"
9550,"SIX, the helicopter has arrived in Kolkata. Goes deep in his crease and flicks it with a lot of power. He's started playing this shot even better than the man who invented it. Towering six over the deep mid-wicket fence"
9551,"FOUR, wide full toss outside off and it's been sliced over cover-point. What a knock this is proving to be. If team had Russell, team got Pandya. Two of the cleanest strikers of the cricket ball playing this match"
9552,"out Caught by Nitish Rana!! bowler comes back into the attack and breaks the partnership that was turning out to be a threatening one. A floated delivery delivery leg, batsman flicks it towards deep mid-wicket in his quest to clear the fence but doesn't get the timing right. Rana who was stationed near the fence, charges forward and puts in a dive to complete the catch. batsman c Nitish Rana b bowler 20(21) [4s-2]"
9553,"SIX, fastest fifty of IPL 2019. This is insane hitting by the six hitting machine. He's turning it on here! Heaves the flatter delivery over the deep mid-wicket fence for a massive six, gets to his half century in style. What a knock!"
9554,"FOUR, full in length by Narina and batsman hacks it into the gap at deep mid-wicket. The ball is just sailing all over the park, the fielders are going to have a neck-ache by the end of this innings"
9555,"SIX, batsman joins the party now. Why should Hardik have all the fun, says the elder brother. Goes down on his knee and smokes it over long-on for half a dozen"
9556,"1 run, dropped! Miscommunication between Karthik and Uthappa and they've put down a sitter. Uthappa had called for it but DK tries to go for the catch and the former ends up spilling it. Pandya had horribly miscued this slog as the top-edge ballooned into the off side"
9557,"byes, FOUR, fires this one at 120ks around off and beats both the batsman and the wicket-keeper. Frustration creeping in and that delivery by bowler says it all"
9558,"FOUR, floated outside off and Hardik has chipped it over covers for four runs, runs are leaking as Pandya brothers are having some fun out in the middle"
9559,"FOUR, hammered! Things going worse for bowler who has now conceded 48 runs. Another floated delivery outside off and Hardik slams it through the gap at covers. Hardik's looking unstoppable"
9560,"FOUR, Hardik is in some pain but he's keeping the scoreboard ticking. Smacking 'em all over! Goes down on his knee and bludgeons it right over the bowler's head for a boundary"
9561,"SIX, bring out the helmet folks! Hardik gets underneath this full delivery and tonks it over the deep mid-wicket fence for another massive six. It's raining sixes!"
9562,"1 run, 50-run stand up between Hardik and Krunal! Slaps the shortish delivery to mid-off for a single, does Hardik"
9563,"SIX, magnificent shot by Hardik! Russell hit 8 sixes in his innings but Hardik has just hit his 9th maximum of the night. Gets inside the line and picks up the length delivery over deep square leg for half a dozen"
9564,"FOUR, into his 90s is Hardik! Full in length outside off and Hardik chips it over covers for four more. Amazing display of batting by Pandya"
9565,out Caught by A Russell!! That brings an end to Hardik's belligerence. That was some knock! He set Edens on fire! Goes hard at a slower short delivery and mistimes it to deep mid-wicket. Dre Russ is the man who gets under the skier and takes the catch safely. A round of applause for Hardik who walks back to the pavilion after playing a quality knock. batsman c A Russell b bowler 91(34) [4s-6 6s-9]
9566,"SIX, Krunal is not done here yet! Down on his knee and slogs it over wide long-on for half a dozen"
9567,"out Caught&Bowled!! Piyush bowler becomes the third bowler in the history of IPL to claim 150 wickets. Calls for the catch, sprints back and takes it eventually. Was another googly and Pandya got a top-edge as he tried to slog it across the line. batsman c and b bowler 24(18) [6s-2]"
9568,"SIX, 138.5kph, short and wide outside off which allows batsman to free his arms. The southpaw throws his bat at it and flays it over deep point for a maximum"
9569,"out Lbw!! batsman goes for the big hoick, gets hit on the back leg. team players go up for an lbw appeal and the umpire has raised his finger. batsman decides to review it. Legal ball. No bat involved. What does the HawkEye say. Umpire's call on hitting wickets. The on-field call stays. batsman has to walk back. While going back, batsman has a word or two with the umpire. He knocked down the bails with his bat at the bowler's end too. It was an in-slanter from round the wicket and batsman wanted to play it across the line. Missed it and was struck on the back leg in front of middle. The ball-tracker showed it to be clipping leg-stump. batsman lbw b bowler 12(9) [4s-3]"
9570,"SIX, that is his area. Anything on off and middle, Suryakumar picks it away nonchalantly over mid-wicket. The ball lands right on the ad cushions - second six of the innings"
9571,"FOUR, just can't bowl straight to Suryakumar. The slower delivery drifts with the round the wicket angle, flicked away with a lot of bottom hand in front of square, beating the fielder in the deep comfortably"
9572,"FOUR, full delivery and batsman picked the bones out of that. It was in the slot and batsman lofted it through the line ovr extra cover, couple of bounces and into the rope"
9573,"out Caught by Karthik!! It is Russell's day. He can do no wrong today. Strikes with his first ball. Back of a length in the channel around off, batsman looks to force it from the crease and the outside edge nestles into the safe mitts of Karthik. team are running away with the game. batsman c Karthik b bowler 15(16) [4s-1 6s-1]"
9574,"FOUR, sloppy from Chawla. Russell will not be a happy man. It was a brilliant over until this misfield. Back of a length outside off, Suryakumar steers it to third man and Chawla is all over the place with his dive, the ball just escapes past him"
9575,"SIX, much needed six for Mumbai and Suryakumar. They need to put their foot on the accelerator. Shuffles across, crouches a bit and flicks it over deep square leg. Just managed to clear the rope"
9576,"out Caught by Karthik!! He's getting wickets of full tosses. That smile on his face says it all. Russell is enjoying every minute of it and he also has a quick jig for the team supporters. Full toss around knee height, Suryakumar goes for his favoured pick up shot but gets only a leading edge, straight up and Karthik settles under it. batsman c Karthik b bowler 26(14) [4s-2 6s-2]"
9577,"SIX, bowler is welcomed with a straight six by Pandya. Flighted delivery and Pandya just swings through the line, clean connection and the ball travels the distance"
9578,"SIX, second six of the over. Fired in but the length allowed Pandya to get under it, he just elevated himself and launched it into the crowd near cow corner. DK walks up to have a word with bowler"
9579,"FOUR, googly but on the shorter length, batsman does not go hell for leather, slides on the back foot and crunches it square on the off-side, no chance for a diving sweeper cover"
9580,"FOUR, batsman opens his account with a boundary. That was no where close to the middle of his bat though, it came off the cue end. A length delivery outside off, batsman goes hard at the first ball he faces and as a courtesy of the power on that shot gets a four through square third man, that was in the air for a while but well over the fielder inside the circle"
9581,"FOUR, quite an edgy start for the Kings. batsman goes for an expensive drive against an outswinger and gets a thick outside edge. The ball flies over Guptill at wide slip and races away to the fence. Both batsmen have scored a boundaries but they haven't been convincing ones"
9582,"SIX, Bhuvi has taken it. But he has jumped over the ropes. bowler would be gutted! Bhuvi throws the ball in disgust. It was a short of length delivery on the body, batsman mistimes the pull to fine leg but he gets just enough bat on it to fetch a maximum"
9583,"FOUR, smashed! This is an excellent shot. On a length and on the stumps, batsman uses a straight bat and tonks it straight down the ground. It rockets to the fence"
9584,"FOUR, another boundary from batsman. He is putting on a show here for Punjab. It was a slower one and was wide of off, batsman goes down on his knees and sweeps it through fine leg for a boundary. Great connection!"
9585,"out Caught by Bhuvneshwar!! Bhuvi has made amends. He has taken a spectacular catch at fine leg! And the orange army supporters are on their feet in the crowd. Umpires have gone for a review just to be absolutely sure. Soft signal is OUT and he is OUT. It was a terrific short delivery on the face, batsman was clearly beaten by the pace there. The situation demanded him to play another big shot and he went after it again via: A pull shot. Gets it off the top-half, Bhuvi at fine leg, charges forward, dives in a dramatic fashion and takes a beauty. batsman c Bhuvneshwar b bowler 21(10) [4s-2 6s-2]"
9586,"FOUR, freebie and batsman puts it away. Need to make this into a big over now. Long hop and batsman had ample time to pick his spot, rocked back and pulled it in front of square"
9587,"out Caught by Shankar!! Second for Rashid. Not the greatest of deliveries but team won't be complaining. Another one of team's big hitters is back in the pavilion. It was a half tracker and batsman picked it early, went back and pulled it flat to deep mid-wicket. He just could not place it better. batsman c Shankar b bowler 11(11) [4s-1]"
9588,"out Caught by Manish Pandey!! Rashid is on a hat-trick. batsman coming ahead of debutant Prabhsimran doesn't pay off. What started with a boundary has ended with two wickets. Googly outside off, batsman spotted it off the hand and heaved it with the spin, but could not generate power to clear long-on. Pandey takes a sitter. batsman c Manish Pandey b bowler 0(1)"
9589,"SIX, batsman has no other option but to go for it. Even though he is losing partners in a heap at the other end. Quicker and outside off, batsman lofts it handsomely over extra cover and clears the rope comfortably. The most difficult shot to play against an offie and he's made it look ridiculously easy"
9590,"SIX, now is helped by bowler. A full toss just below the waist, batsman waits and swings it over long leg. Back to back sixes and with that it also brings up the fifty for batsman. The chase depends on him"
9591,"SIX, clobbered! Bhuvi starts with a length delivery right in the slot, batsman with a cleared front leg swings through the line and gets plenty of distance over long-on"
9592,"FOUR, knuckle ball and batsman smokes it over extra cover. He made room and generated enough power to take it over Williamson, the ball bounced just inside the rope"
9593,"SIX, a one-handed six from batsman. A full toss, batsman went deep in the crease and smashes it straight back over Sandeep, with the bottom hand coming off the bat handle"
9594,"SIX, wow! Seemed to be a mishit but Warner watches it sail over him. Full, slow and outside off, Simran lofts it off the base of the bat and it soars just over long-off"
9595,"out Caught by Williamson!! Fine catch! Khaleel picks up his third wicket. He's been the pick of the bowlers along with Rashid. Change of pace and batsman went after it, cleared his front leg and swung as hard as possible, came off the toe-end and went straight up, Williamson ran across from extra cover and took it near mid-off. It was in the air for a long time and the skipper had to put in a dive to take it. batsman c Williamson b bowler 79(56) [4s-4 6s-5]"
9596,"FOUR, slower delivery combined with width, Simran flays it behind point and bisected the fielders expertly"
9597,"out Lbw!! Looked a 50-50 call and that's why only Sandeep went up for it. A slow dipping yorker and Simran swings blindly without watching the ball, the ball lands in front of him and strikes him on the back leg around leg-stump. Ball-tracking has to be kissing the stumps. batsman lbw b bowler 16(17) [4s-1 6s-1]"
9598,"out Bowled!! It was a matter of Sandeep getting it on target. Another knuckle ball and batsman slogs without a clue in the world, the ball arrives later to mess up the stumps. Is it going to be a double wicket maiden for Sandeep? batsman b bowler 0(3)"
9599,"out Caught by Manish Pandey!! bowler strikes as Manish Pandey takes a skier. No special knock by the Universe Boss tonight. Goes hard at a length delivery and gets a top-edge that goes miles up in the air. Manish at point settles under it and takes it, not on the first but on the second attempt. The ball almost popped out of Manish's hands who did well to cling on the catch eventually. Sunrisers on top! batsman c Manish Pandey b bowler 4(3) [4s-1]"
9600,"SIX, that's the kind of form, KL batsman has been in. Stands tall and flicks the length delivery over deep mid-wicket for a towering six, his first one of the night"
9601,"FOUR, deft touch! On the pads and batsman clips it past the fielder at short fine leg. The fielder in the deep was very square in order to cut this down"
9602,"FOUR, all about class! Down on his knee early and picks the slower delivery over fine leg for a boundary. Was the slower delivery and batsman played the lap shot to perfecion. Almost got a six as the ball hit the cushions on a boundary"
9603,"FOUR, Rashid lost in the lights there. And he has allowed it to go for a boundary. batsman rocks back and thumps it straight to sweeper cover. Rashid should have stopped it on the bounce but instead he lets it go and gifts a boundary to Kings"
9604,"FOUR, batsman is flowing like a river. He is timing the ball so very well. But the required rate demands more out of this. It was a slower one on the stumps, batsman flicks it handsomely, beats fine leg and it races to the fence"
9605,"SIX, that's been belted by batsman. He sure has some muscle power and he has flaunted it there! He plunges forward, clears his front leg, keeps his shape and absolutely smashes it over long-off for a gigantic six"
9606,"out Caught by Shankar!! Mayank gets greedy there. And he pays the price for it. Rashid is so skilfull a bowler that you just can't hit him for consecutive sixes. It was a flighted delivery on the stumps, batsman goes down on his knees and wanted to launch it over deep mid-wicket, fails to connect as well as he would have liked. And ends up gifting a catch to Shankar at deep mid-wicket. batsman c Shankar b bowler 27(18) [4s-2 6s-1]"
9607,"SIX, that's more like it, Kings need more of these hits. It was on a fuller length, batsman gets under it, clears his leg, opens up his shoulders and dispatches it over long-on. High and handsome!"
9608,"FOUR, erratic and batsman puts it away this time. Arshdeep strayed on the pads once more with this pacy inswinger, the southpaw just had to get bat on it and he tickled it past the keeper. Fine leg was quite squarer and had no chance"
9609,"FOUR, this is poor bowling from Arshdeep after a good start. Once again errs in line, feeds it down leg and batsman takes full toll of this inswinger. Fine is up in the ring and this is clipped fine enough. All too easy"
9610,"SIX, beautifully struck! Turn on this off break but there is width on offer and batsman does the smart thing, goes with the turn as he chips it over wide long-off. More of an extended defensive push and it goes all the way. Shot of a man in supreme form"
9611,"FOUR, delicate hands from Pandey. Ashwin pulls his length and feeds him with width outside off, Pandey goes deep in his crease and opens his bat face at the last moment to place it in the gap past point. The timing is flawless and the sweeper in the deep had no chance"
9612,"1 run, oh boy! He almost had it till the last second there is Ashwin, would've been a stunner had he held onto it, but unfortunately, he couldn't and Pandey gets a lifeline. Fullish and on off, Pandey lifts it hard and ends up hitting it towards team skipper at mid-off, who leapt high and plucked it with his right-hand. He was air-borne when he took it but just when his heels touched the ground, the ball popped out of his hands. Very unlucky"
9613,"FOUR, fifty for batsman. It's most likely his last game for the season and he wants to finish on a high. Shorter and wobbled away just outside off, batsman waited deep and slashed at it, thick outside edge runs away to the third man fence. team dug-out up on their feet and batsman acknowledges them with a raise of the bat"
9614,"SIX, 50-stand comes up between the duo with this maximum. Such a clean strike from Pandey. Tossed up at th stumps, Pandey loads up big time and hammers it over the bowler's head. Held his shape and connected it beautifully"
9615,"FOUR, There's the trademark switch-hit from batsman. Flighted full just outside off, batsman changes his stance and lifts it over short third man. He was itching to play this shot for a while, does so now.."
9616,"FOUR, well, the plan was good from Arshdeep, but the execution part went wrong. Swerving in, tried for the yorker but missed by a few inches. Ends up as a low full toss on the pads for batsman, who gets across and flicks it past Gayle at short fine leg. Cricket can be cruel sometimes, ain't it?"
9617,"FOUR, this is poor from the youngster. Nah, nah, not where you bowl with fine leg inside the ring. Went for the bouncer, but didn't quite hit his target. Pandey gets on top of it and pulls it over short fine leg for a boundary"
9618,"out Caught by Shami!! bowler removes Pandey. Finally, a wicket for team which should give them some lift. Wasn't that great a delivery from bowler. Rifled it quick - the carrom ball and down leg, Pandey tried to be cheeky and thought of helping it over the man at 45. But he didn't get the required timing to clear the fielder and hits it to Shami at short fine leg, who clings onto it. First wicket for bowler and let's see if they can put the brakes from here. batsman c Shami b bowler 36(25) [4s-3 6s-1]"
9619,"out Caught by Mujeeb!! Wow! Is this the game-changing over from bowler? He's gotten rid of both the set-batsmen in this over and batsman is livid with himself as he thuds his bat onto his pads. But doesn't matter because he's played a fabulous knock here. The Hyderabad crowd gives him a rousing reception. It was the round-arm darter from bowler, bowled it quick outside off. batsman with a tired looking shot as he threw his bat and skews it up towards point, who takes a couple of steps back and grabs it. batsman c Mujeeb b bowler 81(56) [4s-7 6s-2]"
9620,"FOUR, what has Gayle done there? He's kicked that ball away to the boundary. Went for the chase from short third man and ends up kicking it away to the fence. batsman went hard at this one as the thick outside edge flew over the fielders at short third and backward point"
9621,"SIX, that's more like it! Goes down on his knee and hacks the floated delivery over deep backward square leg for half a dozen does the team skipper"
9622,"SIX, time for batsman to join in the party! Takes on his Afghan team mate and thumps the floated delivery right over the bowler's head for a clean six, couldn't have played it any better"
9623,"SIX, bowler has conceded 65 runs already! batsman gets underneath the full ball and smokes it right into the sightscreen. He's turning it on here, brilliant striking and the decibels have gone a notch higher in Hyderabad. Crowd is loving it"
9624,"out Caught by Murugan Ashwin!! That's a stunning catch by Murugan Ashwin at cover as he times his jump to perfection and plucks it out of thin air. Was a back of a length delivery and batsman had chipped it in order to clear the infield, however the fielder does well to pull off a blinder. With 10 balls remaining, batsman had to go for it and perishes in his quest to get some quick runs. batsman c Murugan Ashwin b bowler 14(7) [4s-1 6s-1]"
9625,"out Bowled!! bowler has ripped the stumps apart. Dishes out a sizzling full length delivery and it was the pace that got the better of him. batsman swung hard but there was daylight between his willow and the ball - end result is that the sticks are rattled and it's game over for batsman, at least with the bat. batsman b bowler 20(10) [6s-2]"
9626,out Bowled!! Wickets are tumbling towards the death but the total is more than enough. bowler nails his yorker right and uproots the leg-stump as batsman fails to squeeze it out. Some decent death bowling by Kings XI Punjab. batsman b bowler 1(2)
9627,"FOUR, that's a crispy drive by batsman! An overpitched delivery outside off and the southpaw creams it through extra cover. Miller in the deep sprinted across and although he put in a dive, he couldn't quite stop the ball, four runs for the young batsman"
9628,"FOUR, heaved over mid-wicket! Looked ungainly from batsman but he's managed to clear the infield with ease. Was a length ball, picked from outside off and lobbed with a heave across the line"
9629,"byes, FOUR, bonus runs! It's an IPL debut for Simran Singh and this won't do much to his confidence, that's for sure. Was a slower ball from Arshdeep and batsman wanted to hoick across the line. Got beaten by the lack of pace and it went on the bounce to Simran Singh who just couldn't cover the line as it sneaked past him to the fence. Don't want to be gifting easy runs to the opposition, not in such high-pressure games"
9630,"FOUR, batsman is having fun! Slower and fuller, he just shuffles a bit and slog sweeps merrily over backward square leg. Clean strike and it races away to the fence"
9631,"FOUR, this is superb batting! He's toying with the field, batsman. Makes a bit of room to the loopy off break and goes with the turn on this chip over extra cover. Another clean connection and the boundaries continue to rain here in Hyderabad"
9632,"FOUR, fastest fifty partnership in IPL 2019! team are on rampage here! batsman joins in the fun with a lovely paddle sweep, the line was too straight from bowler and it was helped away quite fine. Well wide of short fine leg who could do nothing"
9633,"FOUR, sublime from batsman! He's looking in great touch tonight, isn't he? Too full from bowler and it's been drop kicked over wide mid-on. Supple stuff and easily over the infield"
9634,"SIX, my word, hasn't he clobbered this or what! batsman is going bonkers here! Gets one slightly too short from bowler and belts the pull over deep backward square leg. Absolutely waded into the pull and sent it deep into the crowd"
9635,"SIX, the team skipper is welcomed with some rough treatment! batsman shuffles around in the crease and slog sweeps this over fine leg for a maximum. No respite whatsoever from the Orange Army thus far"
9636,"out Caught by Simran Singh!! Murugan draws first blood! Was a quickish slider and batsman wanted to pull across the line. Got a tiny under edge and Simran Singh who had looked awful initially, held on to a brilliant catch. The fun part began after this, because the appeal for caught behind wasn't given at first. As team were about to review, the umpire raised his finger but batsman didn't probably see that. He was standing with Warner, which made it seem like he wanted the review. It seems like he wasn't clear of the decision and once it was clarified, he walked away batsman c Simran Singh b bowler 28(13) [4s-3 6s-1]"
9637,"FOUR, superb shot! Pandey is in some form and this shot is a reflection of it. bowler went wide of the crease to cut off room but Pandey backed away a touch to drive this inside out through extra cover. Bisected the deep fielders well"
9638,"SIX, batsman wasting no time whatsoever. bowler pitches it right in the slot outside off, batsman doesn't want any sighters and leans across to dump it into the long-off stands"
9639,"SIX, six more! Not so convincing this but batsman won't mind. This was a short of length delivery from bowler, corrected his length and slightly cramped the batsman for room. batsman throws his bat hard and skews it off the outer half. Such is the power that it sails over the third man fence for a maximum"
9640,"FOUR, batsman is off the mark with a boundary. Streaky but he'll take it. Length delivery that gained some extra bounce, ABD flashes his bat and ends up getting a thick outside edge that beats short third man. bowler can't believe his luck, got to feel for him"
9641,"FOUR, one bounce and over the ropes. 23 have come off the opening over. Went fuller, aimed at the stumps and batsman made room. Cleared his front leg and blasts it over cow corner. The fielder in the deep gave up the chase.."
9642,"SIX, this is some statement from batsman. team fans are going berserk in the stands. Flighted delivery from Gopal, batsman stays low and pummels it over long-on. Welcome to the attack, Gopal.."
9643,"FOUR, oh my word! He's hammered it past mid-off. What a hit. Gopal went quicker and fired it outside off, batsman gets under it and drills it with ferocity down the ground"
9644,"out Caught by Livingstone!! The fun comes to an end for batsman. Bunny alert! Gopal gets the prized scalp of the team skipper for the second time in the tournament. What a tournament he's having. Some relief for team here. It was tossed up luringly at the stumps, batsman flexes his arms and slogs it, didn't connect it as he would've liked and picks out Livingstone at long-on, who comfortably holds onto it. batsman c Livingstone b bowler 25(7) [4s-1 6s-3]"
9645,"out Caught by Riyan Parag!! Wowza! It's two in two for Gopal. Pin-drop silence in the ground. Put your hands together for this young leggie. He's been a star for team and continues to impress. Well-flighted delivery again, drawing batsman into a false shot. AB wielded his bat hard, loses his balance and shape completely. Skies it into the night sky as the timing goes for a toss. Riyan Parag at extra cover calls for it and settles under it. Big setback this for team. Gopal on a hat-trick now. batsman c Riyan Parag b bowler 10(4) [4s-2]"
9646,"out Caught by Smith!! He's done it. Hat-trick for bowler, take a bow. Look at him celebrate, totally deserves it. team dugout is over the moon. team fans are stunned as they are quaking now. Loopy delivery outside off, batsman gets under it and bashes it airly. Finds Smith at mid-off. Gopal is off on a celebratary run. batsman c Smith b bowler 0(1)"
9647,"FOUR, what happened there? Pushed through flatter down leg, Mann sinks low and is a bit early into the shot. Gets a top-edge which balloons away to the fine leg fence"
9648,"out Caught by Lomror!! The procession continues. Parag joins the party as he removes Mann. Also, breaks into a jig. team have lost the plot completely. Drifted quicker on middle and leg, Mann heaves it across the line and miscues it totally. Only succeeds in finding the fielder at deep mid-wicket. batsman c Lomror b bowler 6(3) [4s-1]"
9649,"FOUR, he's been pushed down the order but Patel is off and running. Slower delivery from bowler, reared up a touch and Patel was through the pull early. Fat top-edge loops over short fine leg and trickles away to the boundary"
9650,"out Caught by Thomas!! Another soft dismissal and another instance of an team batsman throwing his wicket away. Patel tried to be cheeky and walked across his stumps to lap it over the fielder at 45. But unfortunately, he ended up hitting it straight to Thomas, who accepts it with glee. PP can't believe it, couldn't have placed it any better. batsman c Thomas b bowler 8(5) [4s-1]"
9651,"out Caught by Livingstone!! batsman perishes. Fast, fiery and full outside off, batsman was beaten for the pace as he loses his shape attempting an across-the-line mow. Slices it off the outer half and it balloons towards sweeper cover where Livingstone grabs it with ease. batsman c Livingstone b bowler 6(7)"
9652,"FOUR, edged and four! Handy boundary for batsman and team. bowler bombarded it short, hustles batsman for pace as he hooks. Top-edge is found and it sails over Samson"
9653,"out Caught by Samson!! No escape for batsman this time. bowler picks up his second wicket. Short of a length delivery outside off, batsman slashes his willow and gets an outside edge which is gobbled up by Samson. batsman c Samson b bowler 4(3) [4s-1]"
9654,"SIX, batsman is underway with a six. Stunning hit! Short of length around off, batsman picked the length early. Stayed in his crease, waited for the ball to come to him and deposited it over deep mid-wicket with a pick-up shot"
9655,"FOUR, poor ball! The line is too straight, ends up bowling the length ball on the pads and that's easy pickings for any batter. batsman helps it on its way with a flick through the gap between short fine and backward square leg"
9656,"FOUR, skiddy and pacy back of a length delivery at 152.4kph, batsman sees that coming. Clears his front leg and heaves it hard and over mid-wicket. Couple of bounces and into the fence"
9657,"SIX, Saini bangs it in short, batsman once again cleared his front leg to pummel the pull. Didn't quite middle it, got it off the top part of the bat. But, he swung his bat so ferociously that it went all the way over long-on for a maximum"
9658,"1 run, 152.8kph, full toss, batsman clobbers it through the off-side - off the top part again. Klaasen dived full length to his right at cover-point, but the ball doesn't stick. It'd be harsh to call that a drop. Saved three runs for his team there did the South African"
9659,"SIX, two men in the deep (long-on and deep mid-wicket), but all they can do is watch the ball sail over the ropes. A harmless short of length delivery, batsman swings his bat hard and dispatches it over cow corner"
9660,"SIX, much-needed six for team. Touch fuller from bowler, batsman crouched a bit low, sets the base and smokes it over long-on for half a dozen"
9661,"FOUR, edged and four! Away-angler at 136.4kph, batsman throws the kitchen sink and gets a thick outside edge that runs away through the gap between the keeper and short third man"
9662,"out Caught by Negi!! This is a big wicket! bowler strikes. Flat, quick and outside off, batsman had to reach out and he tried to go over extra cover. The ball lobs up off the outside half. Negi settles under it at backward point and gobbles it up. batsman c Negi b bowler 28(13) [4s-2 6s-3]"
9663,"1 run, short of length and batsman hops to tuck it backward of square. The 50-run stand comes up"
9664,"FOUR, just over Morris. Lands the wrong 'un outside leg, batsman is down on his knee to play the sweep, waits for the ball to turn across and helps it over a leaping Morris"
9665,"SIX, first of the game and Chennai need plenty more of this going into the final phase of the innings. Slower cutter on a length outside off, batsman delays his loft and crunches it over extra cover. That came right off the screws and went a long way"
9666,"SIX, biggie straight down the ground and almost went into the press box. batsman puts on the dancing shoes, comes down the track and strikes it sweetly with the full bat face right back over bowler"
9667,"out Caught by Dhawan!! Taken! It was in the air for a long time but Dhawan kept his composure to snaffle it well inside the rope. A big cheer engulfs Chepauk as MS Dhoni makes his way out to the middle. bowler gives is not afraid to toss it up and batsman is down the track to go big again, he gets it somewhere close to the bottom and Dhawan steadies under it at long-off. He had run in and needed to track back, took it with his hands over his head. batsman c Dhawan b bowler 39(41) [4s-2 6s-2]"
9668,"FOUR, not where he intended but batsman will take the final result. He went down to play the slog sweep, but dragged it off the inner half of the bat to cow corner - bisecting deep mid-wicket and long-on"
9669,"FOUR, fifty for batsman. It is his 50th fifty in all of T20 cricket. He gets there with a fabulous shot. Charges down the wicket, reached out for the delivery and pumped it over Suchith, couple of bounces and over the rope"
9670,"SIX, Boult tries to take a one-handed stunner but fails to hang on. batsman has decided it is time to go, puts the skates on and heaves it towards wide long-on, Boult runs to his left and dives full length, goes with his left hand and the ball doesn't stick. He was looking to flick it to the fielder coming across from deep mid-wicket"
9671,"out Caught by Dhawan!! Suchith has his man. But batsman has done his job. He resurrected the innings after a slow start and given them the impetus going into the final 5 overs. He looks to go across the line against a ball that is angled across him, slices it off the outer half towards backward point, Dhawan gets into all sorts of tangle as he runs back, but he manages to hang on to it. Kept the hands close to the body and used it as a shield for the ball. batsman c Dhawan b bowler 59(37) [4s-8 6s-1]"
9672,"SIX, parried over. batsman has been sent above to do this. Goes for the slog sweep and hits it to deep backward square, Rutherford is running back to take the catch but he could only palm it over. The momentum did not help him there"
9673,"FOUR, charges down and bowler makes him reach out by firing it outside off, batsman still goes through with the big hit and the outside edge flies away fine, beating Pant to his left"
9674,"FOUR, finds the gap this time. Not a lot wrong with this delivery, it was a slower one and was on the stumps. batsman picks it up early, swivels and pulls it wide of fine leg for a boundray. Sweet connection! First boundary for MS in this innings, this might get him going!"
9675,"FOUR, he is playing a cameo here, is Jaddu. It was an off-cutter, there was just a little bit room. batsman waits for it to arrive, opens the face of the blade at the last moment and guides it wide of short third man for a boundary. Exemplary placement!"
9676,"FOUR, you cannot bowl short with fine leg up in the circle. batsman knows where the fielders are and he pulls it over fine leg. The connection was good enough and it runs for a boundary"
9677,"SIX, this is the best we have seen batsman bat in this season. And it is a positive not only for team but also for India with WC coming up. bowler misses the yorker, it ends up being in the slot. batsman clears his front leg, keeps his shape and larrups it over long-on for a maximum"
9678,"FOUR, not where batsman wanted it to go but he will take it with both hands at this stage of the innings. It was on a fuller length and was attacking the stumps, batsman swings his willow hard. He gets a thick inside edge and it beats short fine for a boundary"
9679,"out Caught&Bowled!! That's a brilliant running catch from Morris. The slog was miscued by batsman, it went a long way up in the night sky and was about to land in no man's land. But Morris for some seconds became Usain Bolt, he charged towards mid-wicket, just about reached it and takes it wonderfully well in the end. But a brilliant cameo from batsman! batsman c and b bowler 25(10) [4s-2 6s-2]"
9680,"FOUR, he doesn't want to get his eye in, does batsman. It was in the slot for batsman and he smashes it over deep mid-wicket. Not timed as well as he would have liked. So, it didn't go over the ropes but will fetch him a boundary"
9681,"no ball, SIX, that's a nasty nasty delivery from bowler. He came to batsman to apologize immediately. It was a full-toss above the waist height, batsman gets his bat down in a good position and smashes it over short fine for a maximum"
9682,"FOUR, check for a spark on the bat! Wow that was hit hard! Hard is an understatement of the highest order. It was a yorker on the stumps. batsman was standing deep in the crease, he gets under it and pumps it straight down the ground. It rockets to the fence!"
9683,"SIX, smashed over deep mid-wicket. You cannot bowl length to batsman at this stage. It was a slower one on a good length, batsman waits for it to arrive and tonks it high and handsome over deep mid-wicket. It sails into the crowd!"
9684,"SIX, he has finished again with a maximum. batsman and last ball sixes is a story for the ages! It was angled away from batsman, was on a length again. batsman slogs, gets batsman power behind it. And gets just about enough bat to clear deep square leg who jumped but it was out of his grasp"
9685,"out Caught by Axar at mid-wicket! He's picked him out! A half-tracker that stays low, picks out the ONE man at cow corner with the pull - a shot he nails every time. Hasn't managed to get it over the boundary and he's out for a nine-ball blob. More disappointment for batsman, after what might be a false dawn. batsman c Axar b bowler 0(9)"
9686,"FOUR, low full-toss on leg-stump, easy pickings, just a deflection away towards the fine leg fence for four - team's first boundary comes after 26 balls"
9687,"FOUR, very full, very wide, 141.6km/h, batsman reaches out and opens the face, slices it away through the third man region for four"
9688,"FOUR, skids through low, a tad short, batsman gets low and carves it away through the gap between cover point and backward point for four - bisected perfectly. Surgical precision"
9689,"FOUR, fired on the leg-stump, batsman gets on his knee and plays the fall-over Kanhai sweep to the fine leg fence for four"
9690,"FOUR, tossed up very full, in the slot, batsman reaches out and whip-drives it between extra cover and long-off for four"
9691,"FOUR, stand and deliver. Morris helped him with the perfect length, batsman cleared his front leg and thumped it straight back over Morris. He didn't even bother to run"
9692,"FOUR, hit-me delivery and batsman does not miss out. Slow, short and down leg, batsman swivels and helps it along the way to fine leg. Mishra was square and well in front of the rope, he had no chance of stopping that"
9693,"FOUR, misses his length and misses his line too. It ends up being a half-volley on the pads, batsman flicks it wide of fine leg for a boundary"
9694,"out Caught by Raina!! Shaw has hit it straight to Raina at cover and he looks bamboozled. bowler has yet again picked up a breakthrough with the new ball. It was on a good length and there was lot of width. batsman was enticed by the room, he went hard on his trademark punch shot, fails to control it and ends up gifting a catch to cover. batsman c Raina b bowler 4(5) [4s-1]"
9695,"FOUR, down the leg-side and batsman clips it fine of fine leg for a boundary. Nice way to get off the mark!"
9696,"out Caught by Watson!! More energy expended by Imran bowler in celebration. Tiring just to watch. He floats this googly wide outside off, makes batsman reach for it, and then turns it away further. Flew off the edge to Watson at slip who took a sharp catch. Delhi slide further. batsman c Watson b bowler 9(9) [4s-1]"
9697,"out Caught by Chahar!! bowler on a roll. Third wicket for him in just his second over. Another googly wide of off, and in throwing his hands at it, batsman has sliced it to backward point. Delhi sinking quickly. batsman c Chahar b bowler 2(4)"
9698,"out Stumped!! That's another addition to the Dhoni collection of brilliant stumpings. Morris's back foot barely lifts up for a brief moment, and that's enough for Dhoni as he whips the bails off in a flash. Superb delivery to begin with from bowler, managed to turn it at pace to which Morris had no answer. batsman st Dhoni b bowler 0(1)"
9699,"out Stumped!! Beaten on the edge, and more brilliant glovework from Dhoni behind the stumps. He's not got him, has he? Oh dear, Iyer's back foot is in the air slightly when the bails are taken off. He's gone. Another brilliant delivery from bowler. Flat through the air, still manages a good deal of turn from a length. Delhi crumbling. batsman st Dhoni b bowler 44(31) [4s-4 6s-1]"
9700,"out batsman Run Out!! Such has been the day for team today that even the least athletic fielder in their unit manages to break the stumps. Thrown wider of off, Suchith leans across and pushes it to point. Watto sprawls across, collects it and nails the stumps at the non-striker's end. There was a slight hesitation in the running as Suchith was ball-watching. He stopped mid-way and lost his balance, ended up running himself short of the crease. batsman run out (Watson) 6(15)"
9701,"FOUR, rare boundary for Delhi. Loosener from Bravo, drifting it on the pads, batsman shuffles across and whips it off his legs behind square. Splits the gap between deep square leg and fine leg to perfection"
9702,"out Caught by Dhoni!! Is there an edge? Yup, up goes the finger. How fitting is it that it's the combo of bowler-MSD which has capped it off for team. Tame surrender this by Delhi. This is their biggest margin of defeat for the season. Coming to the ball, it was another slowish leggie that spun away sharply outside off, batsman on this occasion gropes at it and nicks it off behind. team reclaim the top spot! batsman c Dhoni b bowler 8(11) [4s-1]"
9703,"FOUR, width available on this delivery, batsman makes full use of the room and punches it wide of deep backward point for a boundary"
9704,"SIX, batsman has belted this one. Geee! He is in amazing touch. It was a nicely flighted delivery wide of off, batsman dashes down and larrups it against the turn over long-on for a maximum. The connection was sensational and it sailed over!"
9705,"FOUR, finds the gap again. He has taken a liking to Bhajji. It was full and was wide of off, batsman plunges forward and creams it wide of cover. The placement was good as it beats the deep cover fielder into the fence"
9706,"SIX, pitched up outside off, seemed like a knuckle ball, but Iyer had no problems picking it. He holds his shape and lofts it cleanly over wide mid-off. Brilliantly timed, goes all the way"
9707,"FOUR, short of length delivery close to off, Iyer arches back and ramps it over short third man. This is superb from Iyer who's got off to a flier"
9708,"out Bowled!! Rambunctious roars from bowler Singh in celebration as batsman is cleaned up. He'd got down to sweep this off-break but missed it completely, beaten by bowler's extra bounce. Much needed for the Super Kings as they seek to reign Delhi back. batsman b bowler 19(13) [4s-1 6s-1]"
9709,"FOUR, short ball outside off, dispatched by Iyer who hasn't put a foot wrong so far. Camps back and cuts it through point. bowler shakes his head in disappointment"
9710,"FOUR, bowler overpitches outside off and batsman drills him through extra cover. That was fiercely struck, went to the boundary in a hurry"
9711,"out Caught by Dwayne Bravo!! Now he goes uppish, hits it flat and hard, and finds long-off. bowler is off celebrating in some part of Chepauk, while batsman is left to rue his choice of shot, not for the first time this season - an area where he has a long ways to go yet. batsman c Dwayne Bravo b bowler 5(3) [4s-1]"
9712,"out Lbw!! Spins in and traps batsman on the crease. Up goes the finger. The ball was spinning sharply, which probably prompted the review, but it wasn't enough to save him as it would've clipped the top of leg stump. Delhi go from 52/1 to 66/4. batsman lbw b bowler 1(5)"
9713,"FOUR, squeezes out a wide yorker past backward point. That's superbly done from batsman Patel, first to reach out and then to guide it with an open bat-face"
9714,"FOUR, that's a horrible start for Thampi in this year's IPL. He gifts a boundary to batsman who won't mind this at all. He opened the face of the bat for a single, Thampi was casual in getting down at third man. It goes through him for a boundary"
9715,"FOUR, when you can hit on the up in that manner than deduce it's a belter of a wicket to bat on. batsman charges forward, transforms the length into a fuller one and just eases it through cover. The timing was stellar and it raced off the bat and reached the fence in some micro seconds!"
9716,"FOUR, how easy does he make it look. Trademark of a class batsman! It was on a good length and was angling away from batsman who leans into it and flays into the drive wide of cover like a boss. It beats the cover fielder and canters to the fence"
9717,"FOUR, tell you what this is a batsman's paradise! Just a hint of room for batsman, it was a slower one too. batsman waits for it to arrive, adjusts his bat-swing brilliantly and guides it wide of backward point. This outfield = National highway and third man had no realistic chance of stopping that"
9718,"SIX, this will do! Get-out-of-jail shot from batsman. Ahmed steams in and pounds it in the swinging arc, batsman sets up deep in his crease and clobbers it over deep square leg for half-a-dozen"
9719,"out Caught by Rashid Khan!! Straight down the throat of sweeper cover. batsman is gutted, can't believe his luck. Another instance of not converting a start from SKY as Ahmed gets his second wicket. It was pitched fuller and SKY made room slightly and bent low, slapped it firmly. It was flat and went straight to Rashid in the deep, who gleefully accepts it. team anthem blares in the background. batsman c Rashid Khan b bowler 23(17) [4s-3 6s-1]"
9720,"out Caught by Shankar!! batsman' patchy form continues, he was looking clueless and ends up gifting his wicket to bowler here. Mumbai have lost two wickets in two overs, slightly under the pump now. Very well bowled by bowler, didn't offer any pace and kept it slower. batsman goes down on his knees and attempts an ugly mow across the line. The timing goes haywire and he hits it towards deep mid-wicket. Vijay Shankar swiftly moves across and grabs it. batsman c Shankar b bowler 1(6)"
9721,"no run, fuller length delivery swerving down leg, Hardik shuffled a bit in a bid to flick it fine but couldn't make any contact. It skims the outer half of the pad en route to the keeper"
9722,"SIX, wow! Hardik's intentions are clear here. What a shot this is, nonchalantly picks it off his pads to dump it into the cow corner stands. It was full and in the slot, such fast hands from HP as he takes full toll of the delivery"
9723,"FOUR, muscled over mid-wicket and batsman manages to find the gap. Didn't time it as he would've liked as it kicked off rapidly off the deck. batsman got it high on the bat, enough to beat long-on"
9724,"FOUR, a boundary to cap off the over. 16 off it. Short and hint of width provided, Hardik exploits it by riding the bounce and spanks it crisply through extra cover. No long-off and Hardik collects four"
9725,"out Caught by Nabi!! batsman has been worked out. This is a crucial wicket for team as we all know how dangerous Hardik can be towards the back-end of the innings. It was banged in short, the batsman wasn't expecting it. Gets cramped for pace and room, went for the pull and poor connection sees him slicing it off the top half of the bat to long-off. Nabi takes the sitter. batsman c Nabi b bowler 18(10) [4s-1 6s-1]"
9726,"FOUR, attempted yorker length delivery, errs on the fuller side, batsman backs away into the on-side and gets low to slice it away behind point for four - his 4th fifty for the Mumbai Indians this season, and he raises the bat to the dressing room. A good recovery from him after a slow start. Can he finish off with a flourish?"
9727,"SIX, another full-toss just about waist high from round the wicket, batsman gets his front leg out of the way and slams it into the deep mid-wicket crowd for a massive six! Looks confident, doesn't he?"
9728,"SIX, skids through once again, but batsman is waiting on the backfoot - very decisive, and he thumps it away over long-on for a six"
9729,"FOUR, fired down leg, batsman is late on the expansive fine sweep, gets some bat on it though, and gets it away to the fine leg fence for four"
9730,"out Caught by Abhishek Sharma! 120.9km/h, a slower bouncer on the body, the off-cutter, the easiest of all slower balls, and he foxes batsman. Early into the pull, induces the top-edge as the ball goes high in the air towards deep backward square leg and Abhishek Sharma rushes in to take an impressive catch diving forward. batsman c Abhishek Sharma b bowler 10(9) [6s-1]"
9731,"SIX, short one angled into the body, gets behind the line and transfers his weight onto the backfoot to deposit it over deep mid-wicket for six"
9732,"FOUR, another boundary to finish the over. batsman is off to a flyer here. It was on a short of length and was wide of off, batsman powers the pull shot wide of mid-on, Nabi puts in a valiant effort there by chasing it down. He puts in a dive too but his foot was touching the ropes when ball was in his contact and that will be signalled as a boundary"
9733,"FOUR, bowler strays on the pads and batsman punishes. All batsman had to do was to beat the short fine fiedler which he did with ease with the flick shot, and it raced to the fence"
9734,"FOUR, batsman joins the party too. It was slower one a short of length, batsman swivels, gets in a terrific posiition and thumps it wide of deep backward square leg for a boundary."
9735,"out Caught by Nabi!! batsman would be gutted with himself. He was timing the ball beautifully but the pressure of five dot balls that de Kock consumed in the previous over probably got to him. And he played an overambitious pull-shot. bowler got the ball to bounce extra off the deck. It hit the splice of the bat and popped up in the air, Nabi takes a sitter of sitters at mid-on. batsman c Nabi b bowler 24(18) [4s-5]"
9736,"FOUR, shot mahn! batsman has this unique way of pulling the ball. It was around the hip-height, batsman swivels and powers the pull shot wide of short fine leg for a boundary"
9737,"FOUR, class written all over it! It was on a good length and was wide of off, batsman drives it like a boss, places it well and it runs along the carpet"
9738,"FOUR, he has bisected the gap between long on and cow corner to perfection! It was an offie on the stumps, batsman uses his bottom hand to good effect and whips it with the spin to the on-side for another boundary. He has started really well!"
9739,"FOUR, he has placed it to perfection! It was on a good length and was wide of off, batsman opens the face of the bat at the very last moment and guides it in between backward point and third man for a four! His third of the innings!"
9740,"SIX, batsman has looked ultra-positive from the start and this is an effortless hit. He's predominantly a leg-side player and very good with the pick-up shots. bowler tosses it on the pads and Suryakumar makes him pay. Gets under it and whiplashes it away into the cow corner stands"
9741,"FOUR, whatta start! A wide half-volley, batsman leans into the square drive and caresses it behind point and wide of third man for four"
9742,"FOUR, slings away with the arm, back of a length, a whippy cut attempted, toe-ended away wide of the 'keeper to the third man fence for four. Fortuitous."
9743,"FOUR, the boundary releases all the pressure Chahar built up. Poor bit of work from Anukul Roy. It was on the shorter side and Pandey pulled it to deep square leg, Roy was late to spot the ball and by the time he did and put in the dive, it was too late"
9744,"FOUR, consecutive boundaries for Pandey. Once again the length is wrong - on the shorter side, Pandey makes room and slaps the cut in front of square, no chance for Sran coming across from sweeper cover"
9745,"out Caught by Pollard!! The nudge and nurdle around ploy comes to a halt. With required rate shooting up team had to find momentum and in the process of finding some, batsman goes after a floated up delivery and toe-ends the loft to long-on. KP moves a few yards to his right and takes it comfortably. batsman c Pollard b bowler 12(17)"
9746,"out Caught by de Kock!! bowler ambles forward with a smile, doesn't even bother appealing for he knew Abhishek nicked it. There was a sense of doubt as Abhishek stood his ground momentarily but he started walking off soon as the umpire gave his verdict. Short, skiddy and angling away outside off, Abhishek looks to steer it square on the off-side and sends a fine bottom edge through to the keeper. Excellent low take from QDK. batsman c de Kock b bowler 2(3)"
9747,"FOUR, batsman responds in style; keeps his head still and smashes the straight drive past the non-striker, that was timed to perfection and no-one's gonna stop that"
9748,"FOUR, sits on the back foot this time, expects the length to be short and swivels into his pull in a flash. Placed it in the gap behind square and that's batsman's first boundary"
9749,"FOUR, slice of luck for batsman and team. bowler executes another yorker outside off and batsman swung himself (quite literally) into that, managed to get a thick inside edge which flies past QDK to his left"
9750,"SIX, batsman ruins a fine over from bowler. Plenty of width outside off, all batsman had to do was watch it close and get it over point (no fielders in the deep). He does exactly that by timing his upper cut and slicing the ball over the boundary ropes for a crisp maximum"
9751,"FOUR, a rare bad ball from bowler and batsman takes full toll of it. On seeing Pandey shuffle forward, bowler loses his length and feeds a full toss at the body, Pandey knows where the gap is and he swats it for a one-bounce boundary over square leg"
9752,"FOUR, batsman thinks it's a no-ball for height, but wasn't to be. A fair call from the umpire as it was clearly below waist. Full toss again, Pandey clears his front leg and hammers it in the gap between deep mid-wicket and deep square"
9753,"SIX, Pollard is flirting with the boundary hoardings today, another crash avoided. A full toss from bowler and batsman got all of it; he seemed to have mistimed it for a fleeting moment but got enough height on it to get it well and over the leaping fielder at long-on. Pollard tried his best and nearly crashed into the hoardings"
9754,"out Caught by Suryakumar Yadav!! Gone this time. This one looked like a six to the naked eye, wasn't to be. A full ball outside off, batsman went for the loft over extra cover but he skewed it off the toe-end and offered a dolly of a catch to SKY at wide long-off. batsman c Suryakumar Yadav b bowler 31(20) [4s-2 6s-2]"
9755,"FOUR, short and wide, a slash at that, and just wide of a diving Rahul Chahar at backward point for four. batsman is away. The confidence reflects in his conviction of the shots and his footwork."
9756,"FOUR, short of length delivery wide outside off, batsman clears his front-leg and drags it from outside off, clubs it away flat and wide of mid-off to the wide long-on fence for four"
9757,"SIX, it's a tie and we have a Super Over!! Whew! What.A.Game. After all that long, never-ending confab bowler delivers a juicy length delivery on the stumps, Pandey keeps his calm and marmalizes it into the mid-wicket orbit for a scintillating maximum. Pandey knew it was six the moment it left the bat and he pumps his fists before soaking in joy. Rohit doesn't seem too pleased and he is busy picking balls for the Super Over"
9758,"SIX, round the wicket, a length ball angling in, no insecurities there, as batsman uses his long levers to loft it through the line and over long-off for six"
9759,"FOUR, fuller length delivery on middle, whipped away from the crease past mid-on to the long-on fence for four. Fantastic shot."
9760,"FOUR, short one outside off, pulled away with very little timing to deep mid-wicket for four as Pollard chases and tries to kick it back, but ends up being carried over the advertising board by the momentum. Hopefully, he hasn't hurt himself"
9761,"out Caught by Lewis! On a back of a length and just outside off, batsman gets low and tries carving it away through backward point, but fails to find the gap, picks out Lewis at backward point and that's the end of the road for batsman tonight. An excellent catch by Lewis, diving to his right, and a bit of a send-off by bowler. batsman c Lewis b bowler 25(15) [4s-5]"
9762,"FOUR, confidence, I tell you is a very big thing in sport. First ball and Pandey has put it away for a boundary. Not a bad delivery - short of length angled at the body, Pandey elevated himself and pulled it past the diving mid-wicket fielder. The timing was spot on"
9763,"SIX, geez! He's looks so good while playing positively. Banged in halfway down, Pandey waits for the ball to climb on him and ramps it over third man, Bumrah could only collect it from the dugout"
9764,"FOUR, this is poor bowling. Even the experienced bowler feeling the heat. Sprays it down leg and all Pandey had to do was place it in the gap, tickled fine and the fielder at 45 had no chance"
9765,"out Lbw!! batsman's first game is cut short by a bowler nip-backer. team are off to a flier but have now lost both their openers. This is a typical bowler wicket - fast, angled in from a length and just beats the batsman for pace, batsman went nowhere with his footwork and remained rooted to the crease, pinged right in front of middle and ball-tracking showed it to be crashing into leg-stump. Second wicket for bowler and he's keeping the game in balance. batsman lbw b bowler 15(11) [4s-1 6s-1]"
9766,"FOUR, Pandey keeps dealing in boundaries. He waits for the leg-break to arrive and dabs it past Rohit at slip, placed it fine enough and beat Bumrah behind square on the off-side"
9767,"out Lbw!! Huge wicket and the blue flags are hoisted up at the Wankhede. Rohit is jubliant and so are rest of his mates. They know the value of this wicket. batsman could have played anchor to this chase and he has been sent back early. The team skipper premeditated the paddle and missed it completely, the ball struck him around the thigh pad in front of middle, it was going on to hit leg-stump. batsman lbw b bowler 3(7)"
9768,"SIX, batsman has belted this into the stands for a 94-meter six! It was on a back of a length, batsman charges down and backs away, keeps his shape and smokes it over deep mid-wicket for a maximum. This should get him going!"
9769,"out Caught by Agarwal!! bowler strikes! team needed a wicket and the skipper delivers. He pumps his fist in delight. Carrom ball around off, batsman makes room to go over extra cover, but hit it straighter than he would have liked, Mayank didn't have to move much and took it with his fingers pointing upwards near long-off. batsman c Agarwal b bowler 22(14) [4s-2 6s-1]"
9770,"FOUR, bangs the slower delivery into the surface, Russell waits and waits some more to play the flat-batted hit, strikes it square on the off-side and leaves sweeper with no chance"
9771,"SIX, Gill keeps producing some fabulous shots even though he is playing anchor. Picked the carrom ball, used his feet and lofted it through the line, all the way over long-on"
9772,"SIX, tries a little too much with his action, fires it into middle and leg, batsman gets on his knee and sweeps it high and mighty over deep backward square leg for six"
9773,"FOUR, another quick skidder outside off, sliced away to the third man boundary for four, bringing up another fifty for Gill as an opener - further accentuating the fact that bringing him in down low was always a bad idea"
9774,"SIX, errs big time with a full-toss, Russell opens up his stance and swings those brawny levers over cow corner for six. Tough man man to bowl to, this guy..."
9775,"SIX, ALMOST nails the yorker, on off-stump, Russell backs off and clubs it flat, straight to Agarwal at long-off, who fluffs the catch! He was too far inside, and to add insult to injury, parries it onto the rope to concede six! A crucial drop from Agarwal this. Won't do his confidence much good. And he'd better not look at his captain - the murderous stare of the basilisk will be waiting for him..."
9776,"FOUR, short and wide, this is poor stuff, Russell has a lot of time to rock back and slap it away through deep extra cover for four. Races away..."
9777,"out Caught by Tye! GONE! The top-edge is not good enough this time, as the short in-angler cramps him up, beats him for pace and bounce (just about) and induces a top-edge that falls just short of the cow corner boundary. Tye picks up a good catch at the rope and he's pumped - as are the rest of the team team. They seem some light at the end of the tunnel, now that the DreRuss-shaped Frankenstein's monster isn't eclipsing everything. batsman c Tye b bowler 24(14) [4s-2 6s-2]"
9778,"FOUR, short one at the body, and that's a torso-twisting whippull towards the deep midwicket boundary for four"
9779,"FOUR, oh, it's a harsh game, cricket. An inch-perfect yorker length delivery outside off, angling in, batsman did try to open the face and run it down, but gets a thin outside edge that just about beats the diving Pooran and runs away to the fence"
9780,"SIX, short one angling into the gut, batsman backs away and nails the pull, transfers his weight onto the backfoot, and deposits it over deep square leg for six!"
9781,"FOUR, that's that, then! team live to fight another day, and as do team, who need far too many results to go their way. An in-angler from round the wicket, and batsman sways it away fine towards the long leg for four, to hand team a second consecutive win!"
9782,"FOUR, that ball had no right to go to the fence. It was just touched by batsman on the whip but the timing was extraordinary and it raced off his blade. It beats the man at mid-on and canters to the fence"
9783,"FOUR, this one surely hit the sweet spot. And it has reached the fence like a tracer-bullet! It was a slower one on a fuller length, batsman delays his bat swing and powers it wide of long-off for a boundary"
9784,"FOUR, gee! That has been smashed. batsman looks in his elements today, ominous signs for Kings. It was on a fuller length, was in the slot for batsman. He gets under it and pumps it straight down the ground"
9785,"FOUR, flurry of boundaries for Lynn. And team are off to a sensational start. It was a short of length on the pads, batsman pulls it wide of the keeper for a boundary"
9786,"FOUR, edged and four! Lynn won't mind it. bowler starts with a carrom ball, Lynn makes room and swings through the line, the outside edge runs away fine to the third man fence"
9787,"SIX, that is not the length to bowl to Lynn. Back of a length, is this carrom ball and Lynn sets himself up for a big shot down the ground, his bat speed ensured that the ball cleared the long-off fence with ease"
9788,"FOUR, poor start from bowler. He needs to be better than that. Back of a length and on the hips, Gill does nothing fancy, whips it with a strong bottom hand backward of square, no chance for the fielder in the deep"
9789,"SIX, might just be Lynn's night. Even mishits are fetching him runs. This was a short of length delivery at the body, Lynn swivels to play the pull and the top-edge sails over long leg, for a maximum"
9790,"FOUR, yes, it is his night. Now an inside edge escapes past the stumps to reach the fence. Good length ball and Lynn backs away to swing across the line, the edge evades leg-stump and races to fine leg"
9791,"out Caught&Bowled!! No, not his night. But he's gotten team off to a flier. bowler is relieved and delighted - throws the ball away after taking the catch in frustration. 127.1ks short of length delivery and Lynn looks to pull it to deep mid-wicket, the top-edge takes it straight up and bowler moves to his right to reverse cup it. team needed that badly. batsman c and b bowler 46(22) [4s-5 6s-3]"
9792,"FOUR, oh no! Rahul has let one go right through his legs. Drifting on the legs and batsman whips it powerfully to wide long-on, Rahul gets there but allows it to escape past him. That should get batsman going"
9793,"SIX, one boundary and batsman has found his touch. Flighted delivery and it is in the slot, batsman extends his arms and lofts it straight back over Ashwin, all the way"
9794,"FOUR, that is the batsman of old. Put the bowler under pressure and then toy with him. Ashwin went short with his length after being hit over his head, batsman waits and back cuts it behind point - bisecting backward point and short third man expertly"
9795,"FOUR, top shot! Nothing much wrong with the delivery. Cutter on a length, Gill stands tall and drives on the rise past mid-off, the timing he generated on the slower ball was just amazing"
9796,"FOUR, way too full. batsman opens up his bat face, laying into the width to slice it away through point. That's more the Chris .."
9797,"FOUR, 141.5kph. Another juicy overcook. batsman has a big stride to it, making the half volley all the more fuller and holds all his shape to drill it through the covers. There may be three men there, but he's still finding the angles perfectly"
9798,"SIX, that's right in the swinging arc for Mayank batsman! Loopy on off-stump, he gets underneath the flight and pumps it for a mighty maximum straight down the ground"
9799,"out Caught by Warrier!! DK's ploy to bring bowler works wonders for team. It was that sort of a delivery where you have too much time and end up tripping over while playing the shot. Short, slow and drifting in, batsman rocked back and nailed the pull as hard as he could, sends the toe-end flat to the fielder at deep mid-wicket. Warrier, who's been involved in all three dismissals so far, claims the catch with ease. batsman c Warrier b bowler 48(27) [4s-3 6s-4]"
9800,"FOUR, smart cricket from batsman Singh! Sits deep inside for the slower ball and steers it with the finest of touches at the last minute in the gap between the keeper and short third"
9801,"out Agarwal Run Out!! 1 run completed. Mayank Agarwal and his never-ending love affair with thirties. Lost the count of number of times he's been dismissed around 30s in the last two seasons. So batsman flicks this to the left of deep mid-wicket and calls for two straightaway, Agarwal responds and had to put in a desperate dive to have a sniff at survival, wasn't to be. The throw from Rinku Singh was sharp and adjacent to the stumps, bowler doesn't gather it clean but manages to deflect the ball onto the stumps off his palm, totally unintentional but effective nevertheless. Agarwal run out (Rinku Singh/bowler) 36(26) [4s-2 6s-1]"
9802,"SIX, that's an extension of punch! Just a mere extension. batsman expected the googly and hung back to target the shorter boundaries (straight down the ground), timed the stroke to perfection while on the move and cleared the ropes with ease"
9803,"FOUR, full and in the zone outside off, Curran stands still and spanks the drive through extra cover, timing coupled with a hint of power on that"
9804,"SIX, that is a shot and a half. We have seen him dispatch spinners in Test cricket and he is replicating that in this six-hitting format too. He dashes down with a lot of intent, swings hard at it, gets enough bat on it. The timing was incredible, it hit the sweet spot and it sailed into the night sky over deep mid-wicket for a maximum"
9805,"1 run, in the air and dropped. Mohali and drop catches, the saga continues! batsman wanted to repeat his effort of the second ball, he miscues this one. And it goes a long way up in the air. Rinku at long-on comes forward, he fails to get his hands in good position and it pops out"
9806,"FOUR, boundary to finish the over. It was on a fuller length and was wide of off, batsman reaches for it and smokes it wide of long-on for a four. It raced off the bat!"
9807,"out Caught by Uthappa!! Uthappa takes it without much fuss. And Kings lose another one at the wrong time. It was a slower one on a back of a length, batsman moves back, makes room, he wanted to thump it over mid-off. It comes off the bottom half of the bat and pops up in the air. And Robbie makes no mistake at mid-ooff. batsman c Uthappa b bowler 25(17) [4s-1 6s-1]"
9808,"out Bowled!! batsman drags it back onto the stumps. This innings is coming apart for Kings! It was an off-cutter around off, batsman went for an old-fashioned heave to the on-side. It comes off the inside edge and shatters the stumps. batsman b bowler 0(3)"
9809,"FOUR, he is putting up a show, is batsman! He gets cheeky this time, moves to the off-side, opens up the leg-side for himself and paddles it over short fine to collect a boundary"
9810,"FOUR, now, he flaunts his power! Gee! He hit that hard. He is a short man but sure he has some muscles. It was in the slot, batsman clears his leg, keeps his shape and pumps it down the ground for a boundary"
9811,"FOUR, Curran-show at the PCA continues! bowler misses the yorker this time, batsman gets under it, makes room, keeps shape and powers it wide of long-off! Amazing bat speed!"
9812,"SIX, wow! Just wow! He punches his bat in delight. It was a slower one on a fuller length, batsman picks it up, delays his bat swing and smokes it high into the sky and over long-on for a maximum"
9813,"FOUR, maiden IPL fifty for Curran. He punches the air in delight! We have found another 360 degree player! Whatta cameo this has been! He moves to the off-side, takes it on the full and paddles it fine of fine leg for another four"
9814,"out Caught by Chris Lynn!! The knuckle's fooling enough. And Chris Lynn - miked up and talking to the on-air comms - is still awake enough to judge the miscued chipped loop going over his head to lap it reverse-cupped without fuss. So it was full, and batsman, early into his flick, ends up without control. And succumbs to give bowler his maiden IPL wicket. batsman c Chris Lynn b bowler 2(7)"
9815,"FOUR, dishes out width outside off, and it's just too short as well. There may be a gully and a backward point, but batsman lines up really well, opening up and delaying his cut to bisect those two"
9816,"FOUR, batsman ends the innings in style. This has been the innings of highest quality from the southpaw. And he has powered his team to a formidable total! It was a full-toss on the stumps, batsman shuffles to the off-side and smashes it wide of deep fine leg to end the innings with a four!"
9817,"out Caught by Shubman Gill!! It's no big secret that Punjab are way too top heavy, but team have successfully knocked out the snake's head. bowler - with another - lets out a nice back of a length sitter on the hips. batsman lines up for a half-hearted swat as well, but the ball just doesn't come on. Ends up taking the upper half of the bat and picks out the only man out there, deep square leg. batsman c Shubman Gill b bowler 14(14) [4s-2]"
9818,"FOUR, 140.7kph. There's the crunch. bowler gets a little too greedy, going short without a lot of pace and batsman's ready for it, bringing out a short arm jab to smack it into cow corner"
9819,"SIX, 104.5kph from the back of the hand. And batsman's picking the screws off it, flat-batting, uppishly, way, way over cow corner. Gee, the audacity"
9820,"SIX, 129kph. There's really nothing wrong with this - it's a tight back of a length in fact, but batsman clears his front leg, takes it off the front foot and goes baseballing it into an empty long-off"
9821,"FOUR, 130kph, a long hop, and a lucky edge. batsman tries swivelling on a pull intended through mid-wicket, but ends up with a toe-end, running through the slips - the empty slips"
9822,"SIX, ooh. It's the googly, and batsman couldn't care less. He stands his ground, clears his front leg and swings big, lofting it so damn cleanly, with lots and lots of altitude over long-off"
9823,"FOUR, another googly taken apart. batsman is reading them perfectly, going really deep to this one and then timing his cut really well behind point"
9824,"1 run, brings up the 50-run stand with a clip off his pads to deep square"
9825,"FOUR, lures batsman with flight and bam! batsman had enough time to launch it and he absolutely thrashes it over the bowler"
9826,"SIX, batsman is in sublime touch tonight! Wasn't all that short, but batsman jumps deep inside the crease and converts it into a half-tracker before muscling the pull over deep square"
9827,"leg byes, FOUR, help-yourself-with-a-boundary ball, although batsman didn't get any bat on it, still it's a boundary for team. Did he try the slower ball? Could be.. however the line was poor. Slanted it down leg, batsman misses the glance and it goes off the pads, beats Samson and runs away to the fine leg fence"
9828,"out Caught by Rahane!! And when Pant's extravaganza doesn't consume him, batsman's cheek will. So he tries to be cute, with a late fine sweep past the keeper. But in his pre-guessing, gets a little too early into it and the length's just too full for it as well, resulting in a glove, popping up off his shoulder to a very-alert Rahane - at slip - who runs to where a leg-slip would've been. batsman c Rahane b bowler 12(23)"
9829,"SIX, full pace at a back of a length - never mind how slow Kotla is when bowler's dishing out juicy freebies. batsman lays into in style, walking across his stumps, making it into a leg-line and then swivelling as well to ensure he makes full use of fine leg being inside the ring with the airy mow"
9830,"FOUR, still short, and worse, wide too. batsman throws his hands out quickly to slice it away with a lot of power over backward point. Okay, he's officially in a hurry"
9831,"SIX, the mother of long hops. And batsman nails his pull, flat and with seemingly enough distance over deep square leg. But Parag's there, and he leaps up, doesn't get to the ball but ends up falling flat over on top of the ice-bucket kept in front of his team's dug-out"
9832,"out Caught by Livingstone!! Brave. He might have been smashed for a six, but now with nothing to lose - except this match which is alrady lost - Gopal tosses his googly up. batsman charges down, doesn't really get close enough but still goes through with the hoick. Ends up with a massive miscues to long-on, where Livingstone runs in to, and then adjusts really well to the ball dipping behind him. batsman c Livingstone b bowler 11(6) [6s-1]"
9833,"SIX, yea, he's in a hurry. One knee, angry hands and a fierce swing as he swipes it across the line, hammering it flat over long-on. And Kotla's boundaries are no enemy .."
9834,"SIX .. aaand Delhi make it to the top two, for today at least. Rajasthan get knocked out, officially. Everything courtesy yet-another batsman slog, the usual, sitting on a knee and smoking it into the first floor at cow corner. Oh also, he has his personal fifty"
9835,"FOUR, width to batsman? Really? Is that a deathwish? It was short, plenty of width outside off. batsman reaches for it and slaps it up and over point"
9836,"FOUR, ""Rewind and show me that once again,"" gushes Ian Bishop on air. batsman oozing class here. Innocous fuller length delivery outside off, batsman stretches across and times it off the meat. Didn't try to over-hit it and focussed more on placement and timing"
9837,"FOUR, that's a loosener from bowler. He's not finished it well as Shaw tucks in a four. Angled it down leg, fine was inside the ring and Shaw glances it past the man at 45"
9838,"out Caught by Riyan Parag!! What was the hurry? First ball from Sodhi and batsman wants to take him on. Charged down the track, decided to launch it in the 'V' but gets it off the bottom part of the bat. Skies it up in the air and Parag from mid-on calls for it, keeps his eyes on the ball and cups it safely. team have their first wicket, can they nip out a few more? batsman c Riyan Parag b bowler 16(12) [4s-2]"
9839,"out Bowled!! Chopped on. Sodhi gets two in two and he's on a hat-trick. It's jitters in the team camp now as team are back in the game. Another flop show from Shaw - getting dismissed again for a single-digit score. The top-spinner from Sodhi, gave more loop and Shaw opted to play it on the off-side staying back in his crease. Goes hard away from the body and gets a thick inside edge which shatters back onto the stumps. Sodhi is elated. batsman b bowler 8(8) [4s-1]"
9840,"SIX, batsman is one of the best players of spin in the country and here's the testament. Sodhi gives more air, overpitches in the process and Iyer frees his arms to thawart it straight down the ground for a maximum"
9841,"SIX, consecutive sixes for Iyer. He doesn't want Sodhi to dictate terms. Sees another flighted delivery just outside off, extends his long levers and lofts it over long-off. Clean as a whistle!"
9842,"FOUR, pressure-releasing over from Sodhi. After a great opening over where he picked up two wickets for no run, he leaks 17 in his second. Drags it too short, batsman was quick to pick the length as he pivots back and bashes it through extra cover. This outfield is very quick and there's no stopping those"
9843,"SIX, so, it was just a sighter from batsman. Spots one in the zone, gets low and imbues his forearm strength to clout this into the deep mid-wicket stands"
9844,"SIX, gee! How on earth did he get this away for a six? Parag has a wry smile on his face. This was a mis-hit from batsman, lost his balance as he threw everything at it. Skews it off the cue-end and got plenty of height. He placed it in the gap over mid-wicket and in the end, it soared over the ropes for a six"
9845,"out Caught by Livingstone!! Perks of having a leggie in your team. Shreyas gets the prized scalp of Iyer, who can't believe his luck that he's holed out to the fielder. Shreyas continues to grow from strength to strength and provides his team a crucial breakthrough. Throws it up luringly, Iyer takes his front leg out of the way and launches it down the ground. The timing goes haywire and picks out Livingstone at long-on, who didn't have to move an inch. batsman c Livingstone b bowler 15(9) [6s-2]"
9846,"SIX, massive, batsman has had enough of prodding and poking, waltzes down the track, gets close to the ball and bludgeons it over mid-wicket for a huge maximum"
9847,"out Stumped!! This was always on the cards. And bowlerJi wins this battle between leg-spinners! It was a well flighted delivery and was well wide of off, batsman dashes down the track to play a glory shot. It spins away, goes past his willow and Pant takes off the bails in no time. batsman st Pant b bowler 12(18)"
9848,"out Caught by Pant!! bowlerji is turning it on at Kotla. He will be on a hat-trick. It was a leggie wide of off, it spins away, clips the outside edge of batsman who was probably playing for the wrong 'un. It clips his outside edge and Pant takes it with ease. Golden duck for batsman!batsman c Pant b bowler 0(1)"
9849,"1 run, oh dear! Would you believe it! Trent Boult has denied Amit bowler his fourth hat-trick in the IPL. And he would be absolutely gutted. It was a well flighted wrong 'un, batsman bends down low and goes for an almighty heave. It comes off the top half of the bat and was in the air for a long time. Two men called for it, one was Boult and the other was Rutherford. Perhaps that put the former off, he misjudged it completely and then had to jump back to complete the catch - can't grab hold of the ball and bowler has his hands on his head"
9850,"FOUR, short and down the leg-side, batsman rocks back and powers it fine of fine leg for a boundary. Good connection!"
9851,"out Caught by Ishant!! In the air and taken. What are team doing here? This is the most ordinary batting performance we have seen by any side in this year's IPL. It was a flighted delivery on the stumps, batsman charges down, wanted to loft it over long-off. He failed to time it as well as he would have liked and ends up gifting a catch to long-off. batsman c Ishant b bowler 6(6) [4s-1]"
9852,"FOUR, bowler is really struggling here. He is bowling all over the pitch. It was on a short of length and was down the leg-side, batsman holds his shape nicely and powers the pull shot wide of fine leg for a boundary"
9853,"FOUR, it is getting from bad to worse for bowler. And finally, something to cheer for the Royals fans. It was a fuller length delivery on the stumps, batsman gets underneath it and pumps it wide of cover for a boundary"
9854,"out Caught by Mishra!! Mishraji in action again! You cannot take him out of the game today! Brilliant with the ball and now brilliant in the field. It was a slower one around off, batsman wanted to turn it to the on-side. He closes the face of the bat early, it clips the leading edge of the blade. And 36-year-old Mishra, dives forward and takes a mighty fine catch. batsman c Mishra b bowler 6(11)"
9855,"SIX, just enough willow behind it to clear the fence. It was full and was wide of off, batsman clears his leg, keeps his shape and hoicks it over long-off for a maximum. Much-needed for team!"
9856,"SIX, gets his maiden IPL fifty in style with a maximum. He becomes the youngest cricketer in the IPL to score a fifty! Gee! This young man has some power. And he has flaunted that on this delivery. It was in the slot on a fuller length, he swings his willow, gets it off the sweet spot and it went a long way back into the stands. And boy, isn't he pumped!"
9857,"out Caught by Dhawan!! That's a soft dismissal for the captain - a leg-stump half-volley from bowler, batsman was looking to work it to the on-side, closed the bat-face early, gets a fat leading edge, high and behind square on the on-side. Dhawan called for the catch, gets across from deep backward square leg, watches the ball all along and completes the catch - cuts to his trademark thighslap celebrations, the Royals have lost an easrly wicket. batsman c Dhawan b bowler 2(4)"
9858,"out Caught by Rutherford!! batsman will find the fielder. He is disappointed with himself. But cheer up young man, you have just played a special innings for your team. It was on a fuller length again, batsman wanted to dispatch it over long-off, he wasn't balanced at the point of contact. And lost his shape, it comes off the bottom half of the willow and Rutherford makes no mistake at long-off. batsman c Rutherford b bowler 50(49) [4s-4 6s-2]"
9859,"FOUR, just short and wide of mid-on, batsman came charging down the track, doesn't get hold of the slog - off the toe-end and the ball lobbed in the air, to the left of mid-on who puts in a valiant dive, but can't reach it"
9860,"out Bowled!! The fallacy of the Kotla wicket does batsman in - this wasn't a slower ball, but there's no pace on this off-cutter - batsman came down the track and was way too early on the slog - completed the shot even before the ball arrived, let a big gap between bat and pad - the ball found its way and rattled the top of middle-stump. bowler loved it, his second wicket of the day and the Royals have lost both openers. batsman b bowler 14(13) [4s-1 6s-1]"
9861,"FOUR, nicely done by batsman, his first runs of #IPL2019 - a friendly back of a length delivery on his hips, he gets inside the line and clips it behind square on the on-side, past the diving short fine and races away to the fence"
9862,"out batsman Run Out!! Oh dear! This is disaster for the Royals - zero communication from both batsman - Lomror kept screaming at his partner who was oblivious to his call, kept running down the track aand then had nowhere to go. This was tossed up on off and batsman pushed it towards cover-point, he took a step down the track and stopped, so did his partner and then suddenly batsman had this urge to run - kept running even as his partner asked him to go back. All Shaw had to do was to pick the ball and throw to the kepeer - he does better and finds the stumps with a direct hit. batsman run out (Prithvi Shaw) 5(8)"
9863,"FOUR, cheeky and four, on a good length and in that channel outside off, batsman leans across, opens the face of the bat at the last moment, uses the pace on the ball and runs it past the keeper"
9864,"out Caught by Pant!! The Royals are in a shambles at the moment - a nothing shot from batsman and bowler has his third wicket of the day. He shortened his length and angled this one across the left-hander, batsman's feet went nowhere as he looked to guide it towards the off-side, hung his bat out and the edge carried nicely through to the keeper. batsman c Pant b bowler 8(3) [4s-2]"
9865,"FOUR, clubbed, tossed up well outside off, Parag bends down low, gets close to the ball and then swipes it wide of mid-wicket, bisected the gap between the two fielders in the deep perfectly"
9866,"FOUR, smashed, length ball outside off and Parag has drilled it. It was the slower ball and Parag spotted it - gets forward and drivs it back past the bowler, no chance for the man at mid-off"
9867,"out Caught by Manish Pandey!! The best batsman in the tournament for team flops in the final game of the season. Rare failure for PP as team lose their first wicket. Lenght delivery that gained some extra bounce, Patel was rooted to the crease and whips his bat across. Thick leading edge is found and it goes up in the air. Local boy Manish Pandey sets himself under it at point and pouches it. batsman c Manish Pandey b bowler 0(3)"
9868,"FOUR, looks like go big or go home for team. That seems to be the philosophy for them. batsman gets into business rightaway. Flashes his bat at this away-swinger, the bat face turns at the point of contact but he manages to clear the in-field on the off-side. Opens his account with a boundary"
9869,"FOUR, drilled ferociously past mid-off. That should dent Ahmed's confidence. Pitches it up outside off, it's a tasty half-volley and batsman gets into the act, hammering it past mid-off"
9870,"SIX, what a shot. batsman special. The lofted on-drive - his signature stroke. Ahmed once again hurls it up, tempting batsman and he nonchalantly picks it with all the dexterity of the wrists over long-on"
9871,"out Caught by Saha!! bowler crashes batsman's party. And he's off. Gets rid of the Indian captain, team have their tails up. It was short, it was wide and there was width. batsman wanted to have a piece of it, throwing his bat at it. Only succeeds in feeding an outside edge. Saha grabs it in front of his face and Ahmed didn't wait for the catch to be taken. Roars and redeems himself after getting slammed for a four and a six earlier in the over. Pin-drop silence in the stands. batsman walks off for one last time in this tournament, not a great IPL by his standards, definitely. batsman c Saha b bowler 16(7) [4s-2 6s-1]"
9872,"SIX, goes for a big one and dispatches it over deep mid-wicket. He is taking a liking to bowler! He goes down on his knees and slog sweeps it for a maximum"
9873,"SIX, wow! That has been smoked from batsman. Maiden IPL fifty for him. And he is pumped, look at him celebrate. He goes down on his knees and connects it magnificently well and dispatches it over deep square leg for a maximum. Insane hitting!"
9874,"FOUR, well controlled pull shot from batsman. And it will fetch him four. It was on a short of length and was around tummy height, batsman gets in a good position and places the pull shot incredibly well. It beats fine leg for a boundary. He is complimenting batsman pretty well!"
9875,"FOUR, fantastic touch-play from batsman! This is the best I have seen him bat in the IPL. It was a good length delivery and there was a hint of room, Gurkeerat gets in a fabulous position and just eases it past backward point for a boundary. Stellar timing!"
9876,"SIX, smashed! batsman-show continues at the Chinnaswamy! This is high-quality hitting from the West Indian. It was short and was around face height, batsman absolutely nails the pull shot. But he failed to get the elevation and Pandey at deep mid-wicket had a chance. But it was hit at such ferocious pace that it went through the hands of Pandey and went over the ropes"
9877,"1 run, dropped again! This one was much easier. Yusuf Pathan, the culprit. He got to be doing better there. It was a slower one on the stumps, batsman was early into the shot and it comes off the outside edge. It came too slowly to Pathan at point and he spills it"
9878,"FOUR, another boundary from batsman. He is putting up a show here. It was a flighted delivery and was wide of off, batsman lofts it wide of long-off for a boundary"
9879,"1 run, pushes it to sweeper cover for a single"
9880,"FOUR, one shot ball too many from bowler! This one lacked venom! It was around hip-height, batsman gets in good position and he powers it wide of deep mid-wicket for a boundary!"
9881,"FOUR, Gurkeerat is playing a gem here! He isn't trying to hit too hard just relying on placement. And he is placing them really well. It was a slower one on a short of length, batsman picks it up early, delays the bat swing and pulls it wide of fine leg for a boundary"
9882,"no run, team have gone for a review for a caught behind. There is surely gap between the bat and the pad. And I will be very surprised, if something comes up in UltraEdge. There is nothing on UltraEdge. And team will lose their review too. It was a brilliant delivery nevertheless, it was on a good length and it snaked back in after hitting the deck. batsman played it down the wrong line and it went between his bat and pad. Manish Pandey strangely heard something and he was the one who pushes Williamson to go for the review!"
9883,"FOUR, Gurkeerat welcomes bowler with a boundary! It was a slower one on the stumps, batsman whips it in between deep square leg and deep mid-wicket. He found the gap to perfection! The placement was the key their!"
9884,"FOUR, fifty for Gurkeerat! This has been a sensational knock from the lad from Punjab! He raises his bat in delight! He waits for this delivery to arrive and places it wide of backward point. Again, placement was best aspect of the shot"
9885,"FOUR, pulls and pulls well. Bhuvi gets a bad bounce at deep mid-wicket. And that will result in another boundary for batsman. It is getting from bad to worse for team!"
9886,"SIX, bowler has had a rare off day today. It was a wrong 'un on a short of length, batsman rocks back and clobbers it over deep mid-wicket for a maximum. Gee! He is in fine touch!"
9887,"SIX, why were you sitting in the dug-out, Mr. batsman! Red flags flying high and handsome in the crowd. It was touch short, batsman picks up the length early, goes on the back foot and thumps it over long-on"
9888,"out Caught by Shankar!! batsman has found the fielder there. And he is furious with himself. Look at the anger on his face. It means a lot to these players. Kohli appreciates the effort from the balcony. It was well wide of off, batsman wanted to lift it over long-off. It wasn't timed as well as compared to his previous shots. And Vijay Shankar takes a brilliant catch at long-off. He knew exactly where the ropes were and made sure he didn't touch it. batsman c Shankar b bowler 75(47) [4s-4 6s-6]"
9889,"out Caught by Y Pathan!! Oh dear! Gurkeerat follows Hetmyer in the dressing room. Don't write team off yet, they are still in the contest. And bowler just can't stop taking wickets. It was a slower delivery on a back of a length, batsman picks it off the hands. He wanted to steer it over short third. It bounces more than Gurkeerat anticipated and hits him high on the bat. Pathan at backward point makes no mistake. batsman c Y Pathan b bowler 65(48) [4s-8 6s-1]"
9890,"out Caught by Manish Pandey!! team in Kamikaze mode here at the Chinnaswamy. And bowler with the breakthrough again for team. He has been absolutely superb for his side. It was another well disguised slower one and was wide of off, batsman wanted to lift it over mid-on. He was taken aback by the slower one, he miscues it horribly and Pandey at mid-on takes it with utmost ease. batsman c Manish Pandey b bowler 0(1)"
9891,"FOUR, terrible delivery from bowler! It was full and there was lot of room, Yadav chases it and pumps it wide of backward point for a boundary"
9892,"FOUR, boundary for Yadav. And he has finished off this match! team win by 4 wickets! Hugs in the team camp. Finally, something for team fans to cheer who have been truly incredible in this season. Kohli with a child-like jump in the dressing room! He has a wide smile on his face! bowler was guilty of providing the width again and it was in the slot again, Yadav throws his bat at it and powers it wide of backward point for another boundary"
9893,"out Caught by Guptill!! ABD goes. Big, big wicket for team and they are cock-a-hoop. Like Kohli, it's a sorry end to batsman' IPL campaign as he falls cheaply. But it was a nothing shot from the South African. It was shortish and curled away outside off, he just flirted his bat at it without any intent and guided it straight into the hands of Guptill at slip. VVS Laxman is all smiles in the dug-out. team in all sorts of trouble now. batsman c Guptill b bowler 1(2)"
9894,"FOUR, stamping of authority from batsman. Ahmed gets predictable, bangs it short and it sits up wonderfully for batsman. Rocks back and pummels it wide of mid-on"
9895,"FOUR, follows violence with finesse. Nothing much wrong with the delivery from Ahmed, saw the batsman move to leg so kept it wider of off. But batsman expertly flails his hands and uses the pace on offer to cream it in the gap at cover"
9896,"FOUR, that's a quality stroke from Mann. Hint of width and he latches onto it in a flash. Riding the bounce and punching it with all grace and flair - threading the gap between cover-point and point"
9897,"SIX, whacked over cow corner. batsman tees off, gets under a flighted delivery and pumps it just over the ropes for a maximum"
9898,"FOUR, spoils it, does batsman. It was turning out to be a good over from bowler. Goes for the quicker ball and messes it up, veering it down leg and batsman glances it past the man at 45"
9899,"SIX, smoked over cow corner. Flighted delivery from bowler, batsman goes back very quickly on seeing the length and powers it into the stands. Dismissive stuff!"
9900,"1 run, slower and turning in, Mann knocks it through mid-wicket"
9901,"FOUR, too short and too straight from Saini, on batsman's pads and it's neatly flicked away towards fine leg, beats CdG - running across from long leg"
9902,"SIX, lovely, a little shimmy down the track, batsman gets close to the ball, plays with a still head and a straight bat - high and over mid-off, sails over the ropes for a maximum"
9903,"FOUR, lovely, a rare loose ball from Sundar, dragged short and wide of off, cracked square behind point and the ball runs away to the ropes"
9904,"FOUR, 134.7kph. He's right up tall to a delivery that's not really short, but then executes a perfect pick-up-swish through mid-wicket. Lots, lots of bottom hand"
9905,"SIX, comes on. Gets dispatched. A proper sitter, neither-here-nor-there and batsman's always been stylish, clearing out his front leg and pulling it bang off the middle over long-on"
9906,"SIX, 105kph. Dropped short, batsman still takes it off the front leg, freeing up his hands once again over long-on. Ah, flat"
9907,"SIX, off a knee now. Sundar tries going down the brave route - tossing it up - and finds it being slog-swept deeper, longer, cow corner"
9908,"out Caught by de Grandhomme!! Yup, a little too greedy. batsman tries tonking another, revealing his cards a touch too early as he commits down on a knee. Sundar spots, shortens his length a wee bit, letting the ball spin in, which it does to take the eventual top-edge, and CdG isn't messing up the skier, waiting patiently under at short fine leg. batsman c de Grandhomme b bowler 27(18) [6s-3]"
9909,"SIX, a similar length, but batsman's too smart to be fooled twice in a row. So he walks well across his stumps and pummels it off his legs into deep square leg, 86 meters"
9910,"SIX, it's an empty cow corner, and KW's exploiting it a little more with his walking-across-carts. Gets behind this back of a length delivery, on top of it as well, in a much smaller smoke"
9911,"out Caught by U Yadav!! 100th IPL scalp -- and bowler celebrates it by kissing the team badge and just in case you didn't get the message, making a heart as well with his fingers pointing towards the sky to make it all the more apparent. He does it with a pretty innocuous-looking short-wide sitter outside off, but it's foxed Pathan to go hard at it, which he does without a lot of control. Slicing off the outside half in picking out the fielder out there at deep sweeper perfectly. batsman c U Yadav b bowler 3(4)"
9912,"FOUR, goes funky. And gets edgy. Another usual walk across and then a sit to sweep, but the inside half of the bat gets it fine, really fine"
9913,"FOUR, 147.8kph. And dispatched at almost double the speed. batsman - cleverly - stays deep in the crease, manages to get under the full length and drill it to bisect extra cover and mid-on"
9914,"out Caught by Gurkeerat Singh!! Just not in control. Another Hyderabad batsman falls in the quest to pump one over, somewhere, but once again, cannot time it one bit. So batsman picks long-on in trying to go over with a lofted hoick, but ends up getting it high on the bat, dragging it away to Gurkeerat - who runs in, overruns perhaps, but does decently in the end to take it with tummy-support. batsman c Gurkeerat Singh b bowler 4(3) [4s-1]"
9915,"out Caught by Hetmyer!! Another pull, another miscue. Hurries Rashid into this one, and he tries some sort of a tennis forehand in the end, which ends up getting spooned tamely to deep mid-wicket this time. Hyderabad are falling apart, quite badly too. batsman c Hetmyer b bowler 1(2)"
9916,"SIX, real smart stuff, he's spotted mid-off in the circle and is happy to loft a very, very flat drive over that guy. It's his fifty as well - the first of 2019"
9917,"FOUR, oh it gets worse - a full toss now and wide outside off too - for batsman to once again lift it over mid-off. Not quite off the middle, but even the mistime will do when you just aren't bowling to any plan"
9918,"SIX, shuffle, swing, six. Picks out the off-cutter, gets under the length and heaves it with lots of bottom-hand over mid-wicket"
9919,"FOUR, 143.2kph. Okay, well it CAN get worse. batsman makes room now for a change, has his hands freed up to the wide full toss and slices it over extra cover"
9920,"FOUR, lovely, 19 from the over, fraction overpitched and wide of off, batsman throws his hands at it and drills the drive over cover, few bounces and over the ropes"
9921,"SIX, massive, team have got going, comes down the track - did batsman, makes room as he did so and carves a length ball over cover, went sailing over the ropes for a maximum"
9922,"1 run, chance and Chahal has dropped - team have been far too clumsy with their catching this season - short and at the stumps, batsman swivelled across and pulled it over square leg - was in the air and Chahal did all the right things, ran across and then slid, got both hands but couldn't hold on"
9923,"FOUR, make it 28. And Umesh's gifted away the momentum, although with a really good ball here. Bumper, Bhuvi gets under pulls desperately, top-edges, over short fine leg. 175"
9924,"FOUR, top-edge and four, tossed up just outside off, batsman went down low on the sweep, didn't get on top of the bounce, but he knew there was no one in the deep, bounces a couple of times and rolls over the ropes"
9925,"FOUR, back-to-back boundaries, bowler dragged his length back a fraction, batsman is quick to rock back and beats mid-wicket with the pull, pressure straightaway on bowler"
9926,"FOUR, make it a hat-trick of boundaries, he's toying with bowler, comes down the track, gets close to the ball and does enough to clear the leaping fielder at mid-off"
9927,"out Caught by U Yadav!! This was coming - batsman was throwing his bat with gay abandon, change of pace does the trick for Saini - the slower ball outside off, batsman didn't spot it, went hard on the drive and dragged it to Umesh at mid-on. team needed this wicket - batsman though has done his job. batsman c U Yadav b bowler 20(11) [4s-4]"
9928,"FOUR, cracking shot, short of a length and just outside off, batsman made room for himself and clattered it over cover, no one moved and that brings up team's 50"
9929,"FOUR, crisp, length ball and well outside off, Manish leans into the drive, plays it on the up and past the fielder at mid-off, nice way to get going"
9930,"out Caught by Kohli!! Pace off the ball and batsman has clipped it straight into the hands of Kohli at mid-wicket - yelps in despair, but he can now go and cool his heels in the dressing room. Flatter and at the stumps, perhaps it straightened a bit off the pitch, batsman went back on the clip, didn't account for the drift and the leading edge went straight into the hands of the opposition skipper. batsman c Kohli b bowler 30(23) [4s-2 6s-2]"
9931,"out Caught by Hetmyer!! Smart catch from Hetmyer, but think he's unsure about the catch. The umpires will go upstairs and the soft signal is OUT. Did he get his fingers undernath the ball? It's a fair delivery and it's a fair catch, but has the ball touched the ground as he rolled over? Was he under control? Sunil Gavaskar thinks it's NOT OUT as he wasn't in complete control. But what will the third umpire think? He thinks Manish is OUT. Two wickets in the over and team are pulling things back - this was dropped short and Manish's eyes lit up - rocked back on the pull, didn't get hold of the shot, was in the air for a long time, Hetmyer got across from deep mid-wicket, slid forward and completed a good two-handed catch. As he rolled over, the ball might / might not have touched the grass. Tough call, but the soft signal was OUT and the third umpire had no conclusive proof to overturn it. batsman c Hetmyer b bowler 9(12) [4s-1]"
9932,"FOUR, that should make him feel better. Brar errs in his line here - just outside off and batsman is quick to latch on, he moves back in the crease and caresses the punch through cover-point. All timing!"
9933,"FOUR, gift from bowler and batsman accepts it gleefully. Good length ball on the pads, he leans forward and clips it neatly past the square leg umpire, the quick outfield does the rest"
9934,"1 run, half-tracker to begin with, keeps really low and batsman accounts for it by getting his body weight down and dragging the pull to deep mid-wicket"
9935,"FOUR, batsman puts his dancing shoes on and lifts it over the bowler's head. Such clean hitting, holds his shape and earns a boundary. The key was he picked the length and met the pitch at the right time, then his fast hands taking over to execute the shot. It bounces just inside the ad cushions"
9936,"FOUR, oh, that's sloppy from KL Rahul. School-boyish error as he fails to get his body behind the line and lets it through his legs. batsman shaved it towards long-on, KL Rahul moves across to his right and perhaps took his eyes off the ball completely. Don't even look at your skipper, KL.."
9937,"FOUR, appaling from bowler. Splays it on leg-stump, batsman is clever as he moves inside the line and tucks it fine. Harpreet from fine leg was slightly squarer and despite his dive, the ball runs away to the fence"
9938,"no run, a dipping slower delivery from bowler, batsman didn't pick it as he misses the flick and overbalances a touch. bowler was confident enough to convince his skipper to go for the review but it was confirmed by UltraEdge that there was a clear inside edge"
9939,"1 run, nurdled away through square leg and that brings up batsman' fifty. He's found form of late and this is a massive boost for team. Raise of the bat to soak in all the applauses from the dug-out"
9940,"FOUR, bisects the gap on this occasion. batsman reaches his fifty, up goes the bat as well. Similar delivery from Ashwin, getting too predictable as batsman lines up and smashes it in the gap between deep mid-wicket and long-on"
9941,"FOUR, he's changing his gears now. Runs down the track, takes this floater on the full and drills it straight down the ground"
9942,"SIX, it's getting worse for Ashwin. batsman skates down the track again, meets the pitch and extends his arms into a lofty hit over long-on"
9943,"FOUR, bullied through extra cover. The intentions are clear from batsman. Knuckle ball, on a fuller length outside off. batsman sets a solid base and crunches it wide of long-off"
9944,"FOUR, back-to-back fours. It's been raining boundaries in the last few overs. bowler digs it short, sits up emphatically for batsman as he nails the pull in front of square on the leg-side"
9945,"SIX, bowler is being taken to the cleaners. 14 runs off the first three balls. Pitches up, just where batsman was hoping for. Gets under it and thumps it over long-on for a maximum. Just clears M Ashwin, who was patrolling the fence"
9946,"SIX, tonked down the ground for a six. It's in that swinging arc, just outside off. batsman arrests his back-lift and launches it over the bowler's head. For a moment, looked like he didn't get it off the middle but still he manages to get it over the fence"
9947,"out Caught by Shami!! There's the sucker-punch. Curran's the partnership breaker. This should soothe some nerves in the team camp. Went shorter and cramped batsman for room, he tried it help it fine but ended up hitting it straight to Shami at 45 - who gobbles it up. Fine innings from batsman comes to an end. Curran spotted that the batsmen didn't cross, so alerts the umpire about the same. Smarty! batsman c Shami b bowler 53(38) [4s-5 6s-2]"
9948,"SIX, slotted over cow corner. batsman inching closer to his ton. Another short ball, batsman gets into a brilliant position and sends it a countrymile over deep mid-wicket"
9949,"out Bowled!! Fiery response from Curran. Very impressive delivery from the youngster. It was full, it tailed in sharply and batsman was all at sea as he falls over. Gets rapped on the pad, then it deflects onto the stumps. Unfortunate end to what's been a thoroughly entertaining knock from the South African captain. The ton was definitely there for the taking. Good sportsmanship from the bowler as he pats Faf on the back. batsman b bowler 96(55) [4s-10 6s-4]"
9950,"out Caught by Mandeep!! Straight down the throat of Mandeep at deep mid-wicket. batsman is disappointed, reckons he should've got it away over the ropes. Fullish, nipping back in a bit and batsman wallops it off his pads. Didn't impart enough power to clear the fielder and Mandeep doesn't drop those. batsman c Mandeep b bowler 1(2)"
9951,"out Bowled!! This is turning out to be an outstanding final over from bowler. team falling away. Another top-notch full delivery, straightening on and Jadhav exposes his stumps. Trying to make some room and misses it completely. The stumps are shattered and bowler picks up his second wicket. batsman b bowler 0(1)"
9952,"FOUR, shot! Just a mere push and the ball races away. Full and angled across off, batsman eases with a forward extension past the bowler and the timing takes care of the rest"
9953,"FOUR, the pressure is released with a low full toss. bowler went for the yorker and did not get it right, batsman flicks it past the mid-wicket fielder and once it passes the inner ring, there is no stopping that"
9954,"out Bowled!! Cleaned up! batsman's struggles continue.. Apart from one innings, he has looked woefully out of form. Fuller than a good length and batsman wanted to steer it to third man, too close to him and the off-stump is pegged back. team once again lose a wicket in the powerplay. batsman b bowler 7(11) [4s-1]"
9955,"FOUR, lovely shot! Good use of the feet. He left the crease and did not allow Curran to change his length, right in the slot and he creams the drive straight down the ground"
9956,"FOUR, fraction short and batsman is quick to pounce on that, he rocks back and nails the pull in front of square, couple of bounces and into the fence"
9957,"SIX, that is much better. Why nudge and nurdle when you have the shots? batsman shimmies down the wicket and though he wasn't to the pitch, he went through with the loft and it sailed over long-on"
9958,"FOUR, neatly done! He waits and the ball was outside off, dabs it past Gayle at slip and the chasing fielder had no chance. Raced away.."
9959,"SIX, super shot! He is picking his deliveries and time to attack the left-arm spinner. batsman dances down the wicket and gets close to the ball, swings it with the spin over deep mid-wicket. This came right off the screws and went a long way"
9960,"FOUR, fabulous shot! Good length ball outside off, batsman stays his ground and lofts it handsomely over extra cover, just an extension of the arms and the connection was exquisite"
9961,"FOUR, poor bowling. Offers width outside off and batsman places it expertly, he waits for the ball to arrive and steers it behind point - between short third man and backward point"
9962,"SIX, just the perfect over-ruiner. And bowler's to blame -- letting out a rank short sitter outside off, slow as well for batsman to line it up as he swivels and pulls it over cow corner"
9963,"FOUR, well this is no Chepauk .. Bhajji tries spinning one across from a leg-line, alas, it goes straight on for an easy flick right through square leg"
9964,"SIX, slowed up just for a change, and batsman's no slow coach - he makes room and goes inside-out in a lofted extension of his arms over extra cover"
9965,"SIX, now a shuffle, and goes the other way. It's in line with the stumps, which batsman now has the spin for help as well as he sweeps it without even bothering to keep it down. Way over fine leg"
9966,"out Caught by Tahir! A sigh of relief, as the breakthrough arrives! Looks like the topspinner, that straightened naturally a little from the over the wicket angle, batsman charges down the wicket to loft it out of Punjab (Udta Punjab?) slices it high in the air and Tahir at extra cover settles under it. batsman c Tahir b bowler 71(36) [4s-7 6s-5]"
9967,"out Caught by (sub)Shorey! ""Wickets in packs"" - that was Bhajji's catchphrase when he played for India, and it has reappeared all these years later. A gentle half-tracker, batsman rocks back and nails itflat towards long-on but picks out Shorey to perfection! Gives batsman a little smile, and he looks shell-shocked, does batsman. batsman c (sub)Shorey b bowler 28(28) [4s-2 6s-2]"
9968,"FOUR, flat one angled into middle and leg, batsman gets low and swats a sweep away to backward square leg for four"
9969,out Caught by Jadeja! Can you believe it? He's dragged another rank half-tracker with a pull straight to Jadeja at deep backward square leg. What a meltdown. I'm out of words - which can be a pivotal drawback in my line of work. batsman departs. batsman c Jadeja b bowler 7(6) [4s-1]
9970,"SIX, dropped short, poor bowling, batsman rocks back, very deep in the crease, and pulls it with an elegant flourish high and mighty into the cow corner crowd"
9971,"no run, dropped by the substitute, Vijay! A wide and full one, batsman gets forward and lashes it square, straight to Vijay at point where Vijay spills a rgulation chance"
9972,"FOUR, half-volley right in the slot, batsman doesn't need to get forward just leans into it with the powerful forearms and thrashes it through deep extra cover for four"
9973,"SIX, half-tracker from round the wicket, flat one, batsman whacks it high and mighty over deep mid-wicket for six"
9974,"FOUR, another one dropped short, batsman gets his weight onto the backfoot and smokes the pull to the long-on fence for four"
9975,"byes, FOUR, yorker length delivery, batsman tries squeezing it away, nutmegs Dhoni to the long stop fence for four byes"
9976,"SIX, dropped short, absolutely abominable delivery, batsman rocks back and deposits it over deep mid-wicket with a pull for six"
9977,"out Caught by Dhoni! Gone! Another short one, a bit of extra bounce and topspin, batsman tries getting low and carving it away behind point, gets a little big on him, take the top-edge and into the gloves of the unerring MS Dhoni. Another one down, and that delays team's inevitable doom. Not a phrase you use very often, and perhaps one that has made several mortals on the sidelines swallow their words, but this one isn't looking great. batsman c Dhoni b bowler 36(22) [4s-2 6s-3]"
9978,"FOUR, all over! Bittersweet win for team at home to finish off the season, as they manage to avoid the wooden spoon - that was to be team's destiny this time. It's a very full ball that's swatted over mid-on to the boundary for four to seal a consolation win for team"
9979,"FOUR, the yorker goes wrong. Just an inch too full, just a degree too leg-sided and batsman has easy pickings, flicking it perfectly behind square"
9980,"FOUR, 115.9kph, it's a larget buffet. bowler tries overcorrecting, goes short, on the hips and swats don't really get any easier - whacking it once again into fine leg"
9981,"FOUR, full toss. batsman's cleared out his front leg, laying into it with a fierce cover drive. Bravo - at mid-off - is right there, but he charges at it and his old back is really slow in bending down in time, misfields"
9982,"FOUR, and now bowler overcompensates with the drag down. batsman rocks behind, pumping the pull over mid-wicket"
9983,"FOUR, oops. bowler and no-Chepauk is a turning into a nightmare. H continues to keep it short, and batsman continues heaving them mercilessly into cow corner"
9984,"SIX, oh he'll run down now. Closes in on where it pitches and then goes inside-out, long levers, long-off. It's KL, the 2018 version"
9985,"SIX, 19 balls | 52 runs -- the third fastest of the season. And it's just as stunning a shot to get there, the usual straight high-elbowed lofted punch. It's not everyday that you leave Gayle stranded at 4 off 5 balls while you have your fun"
9986,"leg byes, FOUR, hmmm, slips into the thighs, and the thighs are good enough to nudge them away fine, certainly helps his cause when fine leg's inside the ring"
9987,"FOUR, wide full toss. batsman, thankfully, holds his shape, quietly relying on placing it through the cover gap. And the gap's good enough"
9988,"SIX, brave toss up, but it goes wrong big time. Just too full and outside off as well with batsman hanging back in his crease to smoke it typically into the sightscreen straight down"
9989,"SIX, and now he'll use the turn as well. bowler goes length and batsman goes tonking them over long-on, swishing the whack, long, hard"
9990,"FOUR, walking swat, utterly outrageous. batsman - clearly with no respect - walks down the pitch and then rocks onto the front foot to pull it so damn neatly to bisect deep mid-wicket and long-on"
9991,"FOUR, more grace, and rubbed in with more team misery. A very short arm drill, leaning back and generating a lot of power to pump it just in front of long-off's ropes"
9992,"SIX, is that the shackle breaker? He doesn't even want to go to Karthik and punch gloves. Tells his skipper to stay put. bowler dishes out a slower length delivery from round the wicket, batsman clears his front leg and smokes it over cow corner"
9993,"out Caught by Krunal Pandya!! Krunal has plucked it out of thin air. This might be a blessing in disguise for team. They need Russell out in the middle. batsman and Uthappa were going nowhere with this innings. Full and on the stumps, batsman whipped it cleanly and thought he had got it over the man at mid-wicket, but Krunal uses his height and times his jump to perfection to catch it with both hands. batsman c Krunal Pandya b bowler 3(9)"
9994,"out Caught by de Kock!! Oh dear! The faces in the team dugout tell it all. Russell picked the wrong day to fail. His first single digit score and it has come in a crunch game. He doesn't walk back to the dugout but climbs up the stairs and goes into the dressing room. bowler's ploy to bowl round the wicket has worked. Dug in short and gets it to climb near chest high, Russell arches back to evade it but leaves his gloves hanging mid-air, there is a brush and de Kock does the rest. Umpire Nandan took his time but eventually made the right decision. Russell didn't bother to have a word with Uthappa for the review as he knew he had got something on it. batsman c de Kock b bowler 0(1)"
9995,"FOUR, needed, much needed. team will take them any which way. Backed away and created the room to get the bat swing, carved behind point and the pace bowler is enough to beat the third man fielder"
9996,"SIX, four followed by a six. That should ideal get him going but not sure today. Short ball at the body, batsman has no other option but to take it on, the top-edge sails over the deep backward square fielder"
9997,"SIX, second ball and Rana puts it into the stand. Gentle full delivery outside off, Rana just extends his arms and lofts it handsomely over mid-off, the timing was such that it goes the distance"
9998,"SIX, 14 off the 3 balls. This is smart batting by Rana. He backs away and waits for the slower short of length delivery, ramps it over short third and the ball just manages to clear the rope"
9999,"1 run, direct hit and Rana was gone. Full delivery outside off, Rana cue-ends the drive to extra cover and takes on Rohit's throw, he's lucky that it was not on target"
10000,"SIX, just over Pollard. Misses the yorker and bowls a juicy full toss, batsman goes straight down the ground and gets enough wood on it to clear a leaping Pollard"
10001,"SIX, consecutive sixes. The slower delivery from bowler and not sure Rana was looking to go deep square leg, he intended to hit it over mid-wicket but ended up dragging it over deep square. He won't mind the final result though"
10002,"out Caught by Pollard!! Gone! He had to go after every delivery and this time he mistimes it. Third wicket for bowler. Rana's cameo is cut short. Another slower delivery, Rana went deep in the crease and got underneath it, but could not generate enough power to clear the incoming long-off fielder. team needed Rana to play through as he was looking more dangerous out of the two batsmen. batsman c Pollard b bowler 26(13) [6s-3]"
10003,"out Caught by Rohit!! The pain, the suffering comes to an end. The off-cutter from bowler and it dips on batsman, who looks to go across the line, the toe-end goes straight up and Rohit settles under it near extra cover. He walks back to the dressing room and would love to be a fly in there. batsman c Rohit b bowler 40(47) [4s-1 6s-3]"
10004,"out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! Taken! bowler ends the innings with a couple of wickets. A fast full toss on the stumps, batsman gave it his all to clear the field near long-on, but could not get the distance. Hardik is well inside the rope as he takes it calmly. batsman c Hardik Pandya b bowler 4(6)"
10005,"SIX, there's the first maximum for the evening. Lynn cuts loose, gets the required length to swing his arms and clouts it way back into the cow corner stands"
10006,"FOUR, smacked. bowler's slower ball provides width for Lynn, frees his arms and throws his bat. Crashes it in the gap at cover. That sped off the bat in a jiffy"
10007,"SIX, not going to see it off on this occasion. This bouncer is directed at the torso, it was kicking rapidly at him. But Lynn gets his weight back and helps it over short fine leg for a six"
10008,"1 run, good length, in the channel just outside off. Gill drops it with soft hands in front of extra cover and charges across to the other end. Rohit rushed in and under-armed a throw, but couldn't nail the target"
10009,"no ball, FOUR, slower ball goes all awry for bowler. Ends up as a waist-high full toss outside off, Lynn was making room and connects with the slash. Sending it over point and free-hit beckons for Lynn"
10010,"SIX, serves it up in the zone and gets punished. Lynn shows no mercy as he clears his front leg and dismisses it straight down the ground for half-a-dozen"
10011,"SIX, dumped disdainfully over long-off. He's continuing from where he left off from the last game. Chahar under the pump now. Flighted it more luringly, Lynn gets under it and butchers it over long-off"
10012,"out Lbw!! Gill walks off after having a chat with his partner. The golden arm of Hardik strikes for team and team lose their first wicket. Gill wasn't looking fluid from the start, found it difficult to get going and Hardik has trapped him. It was the off-paced delivery, dipped upon pitching and the batsman was caught playing down the wrong line. Completely missed it, getting struck in-line with the stumps. HawkEye confirms that it's crashing into middle and leg stump. The blue flags are out and team fans are elated. batsman lbw b bowler 9(16)"
10013,"out Caught by de Kock!! bowler is turning it on for team. ""You cannot keep Hardik out of the game,"" chirps Kevin Pietersen on air. It was the slower ball, lands it well outside off making Lynn to fetch for it. The batsman accepts the challenge and reaches out aiming for a biggie. Terribly mistimes, slicing it up off a top-edge. QdK back-tracks, calls for it and nestles in his gloves. Huge blow for team this. batsman c de Kock b bowler 41(29) [4s-2 6s-4]"
10014,"SIX, short one at the body, batsman shapes up to hook - oops, he's late on it - bit of a top-edge, very high on the bat, goes over the expectant fine leg fielder for six! QdK is surprised it carried!"
10015,"FOUR, off-break. Suryakumar too continues staying on the back foot, whipping it with a lot more intent, under short mid-wicket's dive"
10016,"FOUR, so very beautiful. And trust batsman to come up with them time and again -- this time courtesy just a punch, splitting the two covers"
10017,"1 run, 140.7kph, middle-lined, quiet wristy knock down to long-on"
10018,"SIX, okay, finally, a hurry. Yadav gets half a press in front and lofts his whip, many rows into cow corner"
10019,"FOUR, drags it down, and fittingly as team's campaign has gone in 2019, bowler too bowls out with a long hop. batsman goes back in, makes it look a lot worse and pummels it wide of long-on"
10020,"FOUR, another overcook. This time Suryakumar's good enough to ensure he doesn't need a fielding blunder, does it with an on-drive, through a straighter long-on"
10021,"1 run, just a punch, lining up well as he carves it through the covers. Also, a fifty -- and batsman points his bat to his daughter holding it up against his shoulder"
10022,"FOUR, it's into the fun zone. bowler gives out another short one well down leg and Surya heaves it further. A tickle would've done here, but no, he'll do a carnage"
10023,"FOUR, woah. batsman > elegance. It's too full anyways and Sharma lays in with a stride getting to it in drilling a lofted drill straight into long-on"
10024,"SIX, and the strategy dished out means it needs only one ball to finish things up. Mumbai top the table, Kolkata get wrapped up. Russell takes all his anger out in this delivery, banging it in short, down leg and Suryakumar hooks it away fine, very fine, very long. Mumbai seem calm, but trust Hyderbad to errupt."
10025,"FOUR, delicate! Banged in on a back of a length, good bounce, batsman gets low, steers it away fine towards the third man fence for four"
10026,"SIX, ah, the good ol' length-ball swat! On a length, and hence, in the slot - batsman plays the pick-up swat over deep mid-wicket for six"
10027,"SIX, consecutive sixes! Another short one @144km/h, batsman swivels on his toe and gets it off the sticker of the bat over the fine leg fence for six. Very fine, and that's landed just in front of the more vocal comm. box!"
10028,"FOUR, he persists with the short ball ploy, the slower one this time, batsman shapes up for the pull, delays it beautifully, and clubs it over the in-field to the deep square leg boundary for four. QdK with an epiphany here!"
10029,"FOUR, short and wide, batsman flat-bats a pull over a frustrated, crimson Russell, to the long-on fence for four"
10030,"out Caught by Karthik! What a deperately fantastic catch that is! A short one at the body, batsman isn't second-time lucky with a top-edged hook, skies it towards fine leg, looks, for an eternity, like it will land in no man's land, but Karthik, the stubborn Karthik, chases it down from the 'keeper's stop and dives full-stretch to take a magnificent catch. It's that kind of inspirational moment by the skipper, the kind of fairytale moment, that can turn a match, or even a tournament, on its head. batsman c Karthik b bowler 30(23) [4s-1 6s-3]"
10031,"FOUR, short and wide, poor bowling, and a gorgeous punch in front of deep point for four"
10032,"FOUR, short one at the body, batsman hasn't opened up his stance, finds himself in an awkward position, knows he'll be late on it, and goes for a blind hook - gets bat on it and deflects it away towards fine leg for four"
10033,"FOUR, fired down leg, batsman steps across, laps it away with a fine sweep towards fine leg for four"
10034,"FOUR, fuller length delivery outside off, whipped away, dragging it from outside the off-stump with a Laxman-esque flourish for four"
10035,"FOUR, short, not fast enough - @138.9km/h but a lot of pace lost on this dry wicket. Pulled away off the frontfoot for four through cow corner"
10036,"FOUR, just over a leaping Bumrah! Fortune for batsman who went hard on seeing the width but was never in control. Ended up slicing it towards short third man and Bumrah despite a great leap could barely get his fingertips on it. Phew!"
10037,"FOUR, nicely done by batsman, he pre-empted that bowler was going to bowl full, bent down low, uses the pace on the ball and flicks it fine, no chance for the fielder at long leg"
10038,"1 run, a direct hit from Rohit and Vijay would have been running all the way to the dug-out - a suicidal call from batsman, came down the track and pushed it straight to cover, bounced nicely into Rohit's hands and he had time to to take aim and hit the stumps"
10039,"out Stumped!! A ripper of a leg-break and Rahul has struck with his first ball of the comeback over - a top delivery and even better keeping - batsman looked good during his stint, but he has to walk back to huge roars - that's because the next man in is MS. A quality delivery from Rahul, drifted in, dragged batsman forward with the length, made him think he could work it to the on-side, then the ball gripped and turned past the outside edge - quicksilver work from de Kock and batsman was stranded way outside the crease. batsman st de Kock b bowler 26(26) [4s-3]"
10040,"SIX, cracking shot, excellent use of the feet from MS, comes down the track, gets close to the ball, plays with the turn and lifts it high and over long-on for a maximum"
10041,"SIX, massive, the pep talk has worked, batsman dances down the track, gets close to the ball, lets the ball turn and then clouts it high and over deep mid-wicket for a maximum"
10042,"FOUR, nicely played by batsman - he's taking the lead here, mid-off was inside the ring and batsman chanced his arm - length ball outside off, he didn't time it all that well, sliced it high and cleared the fielder in the ring, one bounce and over the ropes"
10043,"FOUR, mind-reader batsman. Expected the slower delivery from bowler, so walks across his stumps and gets into a great position to smack the pull over square leg. Picked his spot and executed it to perfection"
10044,"SIX, monster blow from batsman. He'll make a mockery of you if you miss your length. And this is the shot he will play even in his sleep. bowler misses the yorker, sends it into the swinging zone for batsman and he makes him pay. Gets under it and tonks it powerfully over long-on. That's going, going and goes a long way into the stands"
10045,"SIX, it's two in two now. bowler under the pump. Errs again, hurls in a similar delivery. batsman was ready for it, waits for it and absolutely clobbers it over long-on again"
10046,"out Caught by (sub)Anmolpreet Singh!! Chahar strikes first ball! He lets out a roar too and why not! This is a massive strike for the Mumbai Indians as team's last match hero batsman goes. Was a similar shot to the one he survived in the previous over, went hard on the cut this time and it was a fizzing leg break that turned quite a bit. The bounce also undid Faf who sliced it straight to backward point. Super Kings dented early! batsman c (sub)Anmolpreet Singh b bowler 6(11) [4s-1]"
10047,"FOUR, this time batsman gets the boundary! On the pads and he swings merrily over backward square leg. Lovely bat swing and it races away to the fence"
10048,"out Caught&Bowled!! Another massive strike! This is another severe dent made by the Mumbai Indians. Rash from batsman who goes for the wrong option on a spinning pitch - against the turn. Wanted to hoick across the line but could only sky it high in the air. Jayant himself called for it, trekked back and got under the skier with ease. What a start this is for team! batsman c and b bowler 5(7) [4s-1]"
10049,"FOUR, some respite for team as they get a much-needed boundary. Was a bit too straight from bowler and batsman helped it wide of short fine leg with a neat glance"
10050,"FOUR, crunched away! Fractionally short from bowler and it's the trademark pull from batsman. Rocks back quickly and dispatches it over mid-wicket. Clean hit"
10051,"FOUR, streaky runs but they all count! Flattish and turning away from around off, batsman was squared up all ends up on the flick. Thick edge and it beat backward point, all the way to the fence"
10052,"FOUR, this is superb batting from batsman, attacking spin with positive strokeplay. Shuffles a bit early across the stumps and slog sweeps it cleanly over short fine leg. One bounce to the fence"
10053,"out Caught by Jayant Yadav!! Brilliant catch! Jayant is the man at mid-on and he had to go with his back to the ball. Such catches are never easy but he made it look effortless. Once again a wicket due to poor shot selection, the partnership was budding and batsman opts for a pull off the back foot. Against the turn and ends up mistiming it down the ground. Wasn't in control and perishes. Pressure mounts on team! batsman c Jayant Yadav b bowler 10(13) [4s-2]"
10054,"FOUR, crisply struck by batsman, got forward to this half volley and creamed the drive through extra cover. Pollard in the deep made an attempt but couldn't quite succeed"
10055,"FOUR, glorious way to kick-start your innings. Outswinger from bowler, too short and swinging away outside off. batsman stands tall, hands following and creams it stylishly through extra cover. team's captain is off and running"
10056,"out Lbw!! batsman has been given out lbw, he has a chat with QdK and reviews. Did it pitch in-line? That could be the only factor saving batsman here because there's no bat, HawkEye confirms it. Pitching - In-line. Impact - In-line. Wickets - Umpire's call. It's crashing the top of leg-stump. batsman's a goner. Huge strike for team. Glum faces in the team camp. It's a similar delivery that trapped Chris Lynn. The outswinger again, pitched on a length and straightened viciously leaving batsman all at sea as he plays down the wrong line. Gets beaten on the outside edge and it clicks him on the back pad. Umpire Nitin Menon was quick to raise his finger and he's spot on. batsman lbw b bowler 4(2) [4s-1]"
10057,"FOUR, Suryakumar flashes and flashes hard, nearly picked out the fielder at short third man but it's just out of reach of Tahir. It was short and plenty of width for the taking, Suryakumar obliged and ended up outside-edging it. Luckily, gets away as it just about beats Tahir's dive to his left and runs away to the boundary"
10058,"FOUR, oh! This was fraught with danger. The quicker delivery from bowler, gunning at the stumps and batsman went deep for the cut. Manages to get his bat down in time and scythes it past backward point. That was a close call"
10059,"FOUR, there's some helicopter in this one, piling on the low full toss and whipping it into cow corner"
10060,"FOUR, more helicopter. A more-standing one here, staying up on the back foot and the power imparted on it is enough to whack it once again wide of long-on"
10061,"FOUR, lovely batting from batsman. bowler gets slightly short, and he pounces on it. Right back in the crease, waits for the ball and dabs it past slip. bowler livid with himself, swings his hand wildly in frustration"
10062,"4 wides, that's just bonus runs. Down the leg-side, turning away further and even Dhoni fails to get across in time. Desperate effort from Harbhajan to save the boundary"
10063,"FOUR, should I, shouldn't I.. while Harbhajan deliberates on the dive, the ball goes through. Another deft touch from Suryakumar, dabbing this flat leg-break fine of backward point"
10064,"out Bowled!! Beaten by pace, and by the length. Flat and quick from bowler, looked like the flipper which gained pace off a length and went right through Kishan who was in the middle of an attempted pull. Completely misjudged the trajectory. The off stump is knocked over. batsman b bowler 28(31) [4s-1 6s-1]"
10065,"out Caught&Bowled!! Chipped back to bowler. A yorker length delivery that was squeezed back off the toe-end, and not many team players appeared too excited about it. They thought it was a bump ball. But bowler went up straightaway. And he's right. Third umpire verifies that it landed on the pitch, then came off the bat. batsman c and b bowler 0(1)"
10066,"FOUR, the outside edge flies between keeper and slip. Absolutely flew off the bat. Length ball ripping away from off, draws Yadav forward in defence and the turn is prodigious. Watson is slow to react, and when he does, it doesn't stick in the left hand"
10067,"FOUR, drifting down leg, batsman picks the line up quickly, gets down low and paddles it on its way"
10068,"FOUR, walks across, gets underneath this back of a length delivery and scoops it fine. He's been different class tonight"
10069,"FOUR, wonderful adjustment from batsman. It was length outside off, batsman sits low, rolls his wrists and laps it to the fine leg fence. Knew the fielder was squarer, so placed it beautifully"
10070,"out Caught by du Plessis!! Trap set, trap sprung. batsman couldn't have placed it any better and Faf takes a smart catch at long-off. Floated up by bowler, batsman creates room seeking for the inside-out loft and ends up lofting it towards du Plessis at long-off who moved to his right and gobbled it up. The fielder was a bit wider and batsman intended it to go more squarer there. Unfortunately, picked out the fielder. Both openers back in the hut for team. team fans find their voice back. batsman c du Plessis b bowler 8(12) [4s-2]"
10071,"FOUR, loses radar. Yea, the overestimation of his swing - starting on the middle-stump line and expecting it to go across. But alas, it goes straight on, and Suryakumar makes it worse with his shuffle, tickling it off his thighs fine"
10072,"FOUR, dropped. Yadav tries a cross-batted whack, but the ball sticks in, just doesn't come on. And Vijay - the mid-on guy - is a touch late in reacting, but does decently towards the end to stretch out, only for the ball to burst through the palms"
10073,"FOUR, ah, ugly. Really, really bad-looking. Kishan - desperate to breach this pressure he's put on himself - runs down the pitch, hoicks big, hoping to go somewhere over cow corner, but only ends up with a thick leading edge, just past Watson leaping up at slip and managing to trickle under Bravo's diving attempts in the deep"
10074,"SIX, he'll bite the bait. Is happy to go against the turn, milking the last ball of the powerplay that doesn't allow a deep mid-wicket - sitting on a knee and slogging it over. Cleanly"
10075,"FOUR, 131.6kph, continues dishing out full pace and Yadav obliges with the elegant-est of cover drives, on the up,through both the dives of extra cover and mid-off"
10076,"FOUR, batsman is off and running. That is a super shot. Not much wrong with the delivery. Good length just outside off, batsman drives with minimal footwork and pierces the gap wide of cover. The timing was exquisite"
10077,"FOUR, overcorrects his line and is made to pay. On a length on leg-stump, batsman leans into the flick and strikes it square past the umpire, no chance for fine leg to get across and stop that"
10078,"out Caught by Saha!! Khaleel gets the breakthrough and he is absolutely loving the celebrations, mimics a phone ring as soon as he sees Saha gather the catch. Bowled it in that uncertainty channel outside off and caught batsman poking at it sans any conviction, a thick edge and Saha does the rest. batsman c Saha b bowler 8(10) [4s-1]"
10079,"out Caught by Shankar!! One brings two!! Is this the game changer? It's a slower short ball outside off, batsman went for the pull but didn't really move his feet in terms of trying to reach the line of the delivery, it was well wide of him and that meant he got a thick top-edge which has been snaffled by Shankar at point. batsman c Shankar b bowler 56(38) [4s-6 6s-2]"
10080,"SIX, gets underneath the tossed up delivery and smokes it for a 91-metre maximum over long-on. Gee, that power off the bottom hand..."
10081,"FOUR, jumps out, looks to slam it away into the on-side and gets a fine inside edge for the ball to whizz past the keeper to his right for a four. Streaky but much needed"
10082,"SIX, that is where he is very strong! On the hips, just a pick up shot and that has gone many a mile over the deep backward square stands. 53 off 37 looks far more gettable"
10083,"out Lbw!! Fuller and flatter, batsman missed the clip for the ball to thud his front pad. Bruce Oxenford had his finger up and batsman after some deliberation with his partner decided to review. But that was in vain as it was three reds. team are still breathing.. batsman lbw b bowler 14(13) [4s-1 6s-1]"
10084,"out Caught by Saha!! And batsman is not a happy man trudging off. Don't think he gloved that flattish leggie. Looked to cut, was cramped for room and the ball jammed off his thigh pad into the gloves of the keeper. team had lost their review earlier in the over and batsman had to proceed with his walk towards the pavilion. team are in disarray!! batsman c Saha b bowler 0(3)"
10085,"SIX, kneels down and lifts the ball away! That wasn't too far away from Rashid at the boundary line. The ball pops over the fence as well. Much needed sixer for team"
10086,"SIX, length delivery going across and has been lifted away over deep long-off for a sixer. Poor choice of ball and has been deposited over the fence"
10087,"FOUR, fuller and slower, thumped down the ground! That was blasted past the bowler. bowler had no chance. Have team made a mistake by giving it to Thampi?"
10088,"SIX, another slower delivery and has been thumped over deep mid. Got hold of the ball and muscled it over the boundary. Poor execution"
10089,"FOUR, team and batsman are bossing this chase now! KW has played his cards wrong tonight. Length ball on the pads and has been whipped away past the short fine leg fielder for a four"
10090,"SIX, you beauty! batsman on beast mode. Only 14 needed now. In the right slot, batsman has smacked it over deep mid. 20 off the over already. What have you done Mr. Thampi?"
10091,"out Caught by Nabi!! Is there a late twist? Slower delivery going across, batsman lifts the ball away and has been taken by the man at long-off. Was that shot needed? A few dinks here and there would have done it. But batsman wanted to go for the glory shots and slammed it away uppishly without any timing to be caught. batsman c Nabi b bowler 9(12) [6s-1]"
10092,"SIX, in the slot and that disappears! This man is a visual delight. Pitched up and batsman went bonkers to send it over long-off for a sixer"
10093,"out Caught by Nabi!! Length delivery going across and was a slower delivery, batsman tried to take the skin off the ball and miscued it for the man at long-off to take it. This is one frustrating aspect of his batting. Looks to finish it with a glory shot and perishes. Three wickets remain. Can team script something miraculous? I feel its too late. batsman c Nabi b bowler 49(21) [4s-2 6s-5]"
10094,out Obstructing the field!! This is drama. Some thriller novel will struggle to match up to this. batsman ran completely in the middle of the turf and the throw hit him. team first went up for a caught-behind call and then for obstructing the field. batsman obs 1(2)
10095,"FOUR, Paul has done it! team have pulled it off. They are through to qualifier 2. Short ball, Paul got hold of it and pulled it away, the ball evaded Shankar in the deep. A cliff-hanger and team have held their nerves despite huffing and puffing a lot towards the end"
10096,"FOUR, normal pace delivery and Khaleel is put away over mid-on. Back of a length and Shaw gets into a good position and pumps it over the fielder inside the ring"
10097,"FOUR, this is even better. Khaleel has to correct his length quickly, short of length and Shaw had the pace to work with, rocks back and nails the pull in front of square, one bounce and over the ropes"
10098,"FOUR, woah! That is smoked to the fence. Good length ball outside off, Shaw brings that high backlift into play and crunches the square drive past cover-point, no one moved in the off-side ring"
10099,"2 runs, dropped! Tough chance but you are expected to take at this level. Flatter delivery outside off, Shaw smashes it flat to mid-off, Thampi comes charging in and dives forward, the ball hits him somewhere on the arm and escapes past him. He chases behind and keeps it to a brace"
10100,"FOUR, that is a good shot. bowler is disappointed but there was not much he could do. Drifting in from round the wicket, batsman fetches the reverse sweep from leg-stump and places it past the backward point fielder"
10101,"FOUR, batsman is looking in sublime touch. Just leans forward, presents full face of the bat and pings the push drive off the middle past the diving fielder at extra cover"
10102,"SIX, he is toying with the bowlers now. Stands deep in his crease, spots the short ball early and ramps it over a helpless third man fielder"
10103,"FOUR, this is sheer stand-and-deliver stuff! Gets a length ball outside off with a hint of extra bounce, batsman doesn't care one bit and thumps it over the mid-off fielder in a jiffy"
10104,"1 run, gets low and brings up the 50-run stand with a sweep to the right of short fine"
10105,"FOUR, picks the legbreak and pumps the drive over cover, excellent batting this from batsman. Making great use of the fielding restrictions and looking to pierce gaps as often"
10106,"SIX, batsman is flying at the moment. First ball against bowler and he launches him way over long-on with a clean swing of the bat"
10107,"wide, out Stumped!! That's an excellent piece of keeping from Saha, nearly matched MSD (in terms of alertness) there. bowler may have second guessed batsman's intentions and he hurled the ball miles down the leg-side and kept it short too; batsman was never backing away, went charging down and missed the ball completely. Looked to force himself back into the crease, but Saha did a wonderful job stretching across to take the bails off in the nick of time. batsman st Saha b bowler 17(16) [4s-3]"
10108,"1 run, fifty for Shaw. He points at his badge to the dugout. Delhi need him to kick on and convert it into a big one. Waits for the ball to turn and nudges it past mid-wicket"
10109,"FOUR, don't want to jinx it but batsman is one of the best batters of spin bowling. Sees a hint of width on this legbreak and jumps on it in a flash, opens the bat face and nails the cut behind point"
10110,"no run, excellent use of technology and batsman survives! Height was the factor that could have saved him but in the end, inside edge does. Was a lovely nipbacker from bowler that pinged batsman on the back pad. Didn't look dead plumb but the umpire was impressed and raised his finger. After a chat with Guptill, batsman opted for the DRS and it has saved him in the end"
10111,"FOUR, beautifully struck! Hint of width from bowler and batsman lays into the back foot punch, square through the off-side. Finds the gap at point and it scooted away to the fence. Elegant shot!"
10112,"SIX, into the night sky, going..going..gone! Jeez, that was in the air for a long time but guess what, he's got the distance as well! And quite a bit of it too. Length ball, just where batsman likes it and he swings merrily through the line. Didn't hold back at all and that helped him in the end to take full toll. Into the second tier at long-on"
10113,"no run, a chance and Pant has dropped it, that was a regulation catch and Pant didn't go down with the ball - stood tall and fluffed it - the leg-break and batsman pushed at it, straight in and out of Pant's gloves"
10114,"FOUR, cracking shot, fraction too short and wide of off, Manish makes room, waits on it and then slices the cut past the reach of Munro at backward point - much needed boundary for the Sunrisers"
10115,"1 run, stunning bit of work from Shaw at cover - a direct hit might have had Manish in trouble. On a length and just outside off, Manish backed away and drove it to the left of cover, Shaw tumbled, stopped the ball, turned around and had a shy at the bowler's end - all in one motion"
10116,"out Caught by Rutherford!! This isn't happening, not for Manish at least - after taking plenty of time to settle, he's thrown his wicket away. The two West Indians in action - smart bowling from Keemo, spotted Manish making room and followed him with a full ball - with no room to free his arms, Manish shovelled the lofted drive into the waiting hands of Rutherford at long-on. The partnership was beginning to grow, but it's all over now. batsman c Rutherford b bowler 30(36) [4s-3]"
10117,"FOUR, cracking shot, a half-tracker from bowler, short and wide of off, batsman makes room and clatters it wide of cover - the man in the deep is very square and has no chance"
10118,"FOUR, poor cricket from Boult - he was never going to get to the ball, not with the angle he was running into - dived forward and then let the ball go past him, concedes a boundary. The slower ball from bowler, rolled away fingers across the seam, batsman picked it and then swung it behind square on the on-side for a boundary"
10119,"out Bowled!! The perfect riposte from bowler, saw batsman backing away and then went straight with the yorker - right at the base of off-stump. Try as much as he could, batsman was never going to dig this one out - the zing bails go flying and the Sunrisers have lost their fourth wicket. batsman b bowler 28(27) [4s-2]"
10120,"FOUR, beautifully played, nice way to get your innings underway, back of a length and well wide of off, batsman waited on it, used bowler's pace and then chopped it late - behind square on the off-side and into the ropes"
10121,"FOUR, that's two delicate shots from batsman for two boundaries. He waits for the ball to turn away, opens the bat face and runs it past short third man. The pace of bowler takes care of the rest"
10122,"SIX, that is his strength. Anything that is back of a length and batsman is quick to pounce on it, he uses his reach to good effect to thump it with a straight bat over cow corner. Just managed to clear the rope"
10123,"FOUR, smashed! Stand and deliver from batsman. He literally stood there and admired the shot. Similar delivery to the previous one, but this time batsman does not miss, he hammers it straight back over Paul and the ball almost went the distance"
10124,"FOUR, very well played. Another short delivery and almost near the badge, batsman is quickly into position and pulls it with a nice wrist roll backward of square leg. No chance for Dhawan in the deep"
10125,"FOUR, lovely shot! batsman has used the angle of bowler to superb effect. Slanted across the right hander outside off, batsman shuffles across and lofts it handsomely over extra cover, one bounce and over the ropes"
10126,"SIX, oh no! Iyer did all the hard work and catching the ball, but the toss up to the incoming fielder goes awry. Similar line and length from bowler and a repeat of a shot from batsman, smashes it to wide long-off and Iyer races across to his left, takes it over his head but with the momentum taking him over, he tries to flick the ball up for Dhawan. No dice as he ends up throwing it over the ad boards"
10127,"out Caught by Axar!! Gone! batsman's cameo comes to an end. He is disappointed with himself. Slower short of length delivery and batsman picked the bones out of that, struck right off the meat but he couldn't have picked the fielder out at deep mid-wicket better. Axar didn't have to move much to take that. batsman c Axar b bowler 25(11) [4s-2 6s-2]"
10128,"no ball, SIX, Keemo Paul is struggling. He was on his haunches after the second ball and now he has overstepped. Hobbles to his run-up. Is not fit? Full and in the slot, batsman nonchalantly picks it over cow corner for half a dozen"
10129,"out Caught by Axar!! He might go for runs but Paul has the knack of picking wickets. An off-cutter outside off, batsman reaches out for it and slices it straight to sweeper cover. Another sitter for Axar in the deep. batsman c Axar b bowler 20(13) [4s-3 6s-1]"
10130,"out Caught by Pant!! Paul has his third wicket. Another slower delivery outside off, the ball dips in front of Rashid and he is down on his knee to play the slog, the top-edge lobs to Pant and he makes no mistake. batsman c Pant b bowler 0(1)"
10131,"wide, out batsman Run Out!! Here is what happened - Slower ball outside off, batsman swings and misses, the umpire calls it a wide as it was away from the guide line, Rashid calls for a bye and batsman responds, Pant throws at the bowler but Paul doesn't get there, instead batsman trips over the bowler and goes to ground. The ball goes past them to remove the bails. There was no need of a third umpire but Ravi asked Delhi captain Iyer if he wants to continue with the dismissal. He first gave batsman an opportunity to bat on but was convinced otherwise by Pant. batsman run out (Pant) 4(4)"
10132,"SIX, one-handed chip over deep extra cover! Second time that batsman hasn't quite middled it but has as many sixes to his name. Will this be his night? Was probably undone by the slower ball and got early into the chip shot. One hand came off in the process too but what he did well was to have clarity. Chose to go over the infield and ended up going over the ropes too. Wow!"
10133,"SIX, muscled away! batsman is on a roll here! Shortish and a bit of width as well, he feasts on the offering with a ferocious slap cut over sweeper cover. Bludgeoned it!"
10134,"out Caught by Shreyas Iyer!! The hard length inevitably does batsman in! He wasn't shying away from getting on the front foot, even to deliveries that didn't warrant it and that brings about his dismissal in the end. bowler kept it on the hard length and batsman tried to go big down the ground. Never in control and the result is a miscue that Iyer takes at mid-off after trekking back a few yards. batsman c Shreyas Iyer b bowler 8(9) [4s-1]"
10135,"FOUR, poor ball and batsman punishes it! Sprayed on the pads, fuller as well and he just had to pick his spot. Watches it onto the bat and glances it very fine, beating short fine leg with ease"
10136,"SIX, hacked away! batsman is in the mood! bowler fired this in and the Kiwi sat down to half-pull this over deep square leg. Absolutely clobbered it!"
10137,"FOUR, misfield allows a boundary! bowler can't even complain because it's his skipper who is the culprit at mid-off. Pandey thumped the drive really well and Iyer wanted to attack the ball to have a shy at the bowler's end. Eventually missed it completely"
10138,"FOUR, top edge but it's nearly gone all the way! Cons of having pace! Good fiery bumper from bowler and Pandey is clearly late on the pull. But he knew that fine leg was up and hence, there wasn't much risk on the stroke. Eventually fetches a boundary"
10139,"out Caught by K Paul!! Mishy provides the massive strike! batsman was looking ominous and team badly wanted to see the back of him. That's precisely what their senior most bowler has done in his very second delivery of the match. Floated it up, inviting the big shot but the length wasn't there for the slog sweep as batsman went through with the stroke. Skews it towards deep mid-wicket where Paul took a fine tumbling catch. team have sprung to life with this wicket! batsman c K Paul b bowler 36(19) [4s-1 6s-4]"
10140,"1 run, huge mix-up and this has to be in list of all-time best moments of IPL. So, before I could miss important details, here's what happened. This was dabbed to point and Watto nearly ran in towards Faf who was struck midway having taken a couple of strides forward. Axar Patel then threw the ball to the bowling end where Munro collects and instead of throwing down stumps at his end he chose to fire a wayward throw at the batting end, Pant dives and misses and in the end they sneak in a run. For good part of this chaos, both batsmen were struck in the middle of the pitch and team had way too many options which eventually led to a disaster"
10141,"out Caught by K Paul!! Mistimed pull, in the air and it's a very good catch by Keemo Paul running forward and diving low at deep square leg. Short ball, Faf tried to take the bowler on, the ball caught him high on the bat. End of a fine innings. Faf's counter-attack in the powerplay was very crucial with Watto taking his time at the other end. batsman c K Paul b bowler 50(39) [4s-7 6s-1]"
10142,"SIX, horrible ball, short delivery down the leg-side, batsman pulls and times it sweetly, in fact just helped on the way over long leg"
10143,"FOUR, short slower ball and batsman has smashed that over mid-wicket, Keemo Paul has been off colour unfortunately for team on the big day"
10144,"SIX, the slower ball is telegraphed early, got to be well disguised to a top player, batsman picks it, waits and slogs it on one knee to the cow corner fence"
10145,"SIX, fifty for Watto. From 18 off 20 balls, he's raced to 50 off 31 balls. This is precisely why team never mind a slow start from batsman. Slower delivery full and outside off stump, batsman lofts, mistimes to an extent but has enough power to hit it over long-off"
10146,"out Caught by Boult! GONE! A premature end to the pyrotechnics. A loopy leg-break on a nice length, batsman is enticed into running down the wicket and lofting over the straight boundary, gets it off the outside half and slices it away towards wide long-off where Boult picks up a catch. Makes some amends for that hat-trick ball. batsman c Boult b bowler 50(32) [4s-3 6s-4]"
10147,"FOUR, round the wicket, angles it in, batsman was already setting up for this - dances down the track and lofts it inside out towards the deep extra cover fence for four"
10148,"out Bowled! He's been extremely iffy this over, and finally gives in! Angles in, some turn, batsman tries cut it away, chops it onto his stumps trying to cut and looks disgusted with himself. Just at the stroke of the strategic time-out. batsman b bowler 11(13)"
10149,"FOUR, the crowd go berserk! A poor delivery on the torso, on the leg-side, batsman just gives it some topspin and swivels on it to deflect it away to fine leg for four"
10150,"FOUR, erring in line, angling into the pads once again, tickled away fine towards the long leg fence for four"
10151,"FOUR, short and wide outside off, batsman carves it away with a massive flourish between short third man and backward point for four"
10152,"out Caught by K Paul! He's gone! This is the very definition of disappointment - from the crowd AND from the team dug-out. A short one, with the pace off, batsman goes for the signature six to finish with a pull towards cow corner where he picks out Keemo Paul. You can hear a pin drop at Vizag. batsman c K Paul b bowler 9(9) [4s-1]"
10153,"FOUR leg-byes, team are through to their 8th final in 10 editions they have played! A short one that's angling down leg, batsman whips it away off the backfoot (off the pads in fact) past a desperately-diving Pant towards the fine leg fence for four - and there are hugs in the changing room already. team are through to another final - surprise, surprise!"
10154,"FOUR, too short perhaps and Faf powers it through mid-wicket with a crisp pull off the bottom hand, picked the length early and got onto his back foot in a hurry"
10155,"FOUR, stands outside leg stump and thumps this in the gap between backward point and cover. Made room early and cuts the quicker delivery in the gap on the off-side"
10156,"SIX, yet again its that premeditated movement tat enables Faf to smash a big one. Transfers all his weight onto the back foot and clubs this flat over extra cover with a hint of class and elegance"
10157,"FOUR, pulled away and Faf is looking to mae the most of the final over of the powerplay, back of a length delivery on the stumps, batsman waits and pulls behind square, the man in the deep is very square and it goes to his right"
10158,"FOUR, guided away uppishly and just wide of Munro at short third man, short of length again from bowler, this time it's slightly outside off stump, Faf guides and gets four more"
10159,"FOUR, hat-trick of boundaries, short delivery on the stumps, batsman rocks back and pulls over mid-wicket, easy boundary, team well ahead now"
10160,"FOUR, oh excellent sweep shot, got low early with no one at deep square leg and absolutely smashed this shot from the middle of the bat to find the fence"
10161,"5 wides, oh dear, tries the fast yorker and bowls down the leg-side, Pant can't cut if off. 50 up for team and they have got a solid start in the all important Qualifier game after struggling throughout the league phase. That's what experience does!"
10162,"FOUR, low full toss on the leg stump, easily ball, batsman glances it fine and beats short fine leg"
10163,"FOUR, this is very unlucky for the bowler. He's actually beaten Faf with a back of a length delivery, inside edge onto pad, goes past Pant, Munro gives chase from short third, dives and pulls it back, probably he was in touch with the rope for a moment and it's been signalled four"
10164,"FOUR, nicely paddled away, no fine leg, so he was aware of the field and was in position early to help it on its way"
10165,"1 run, punched down to long-on and a big cheer from the crowd as Faf raises the bat for his fifty"
10166,"SIX, swept away all the way over backward square leg and team are running away with the game now. The heads are dropping in the team camp. Fired down the leg-side, batsman meets the ball nicely and sends it into the stands, they are searching for the ball"
10167,"FOUR, smashed! This is the length that Shaw enjoys a lot. Shorter from bowler and it's been dispatched with a nonchalant pull through square leg"
10168,"FOUR, beautifully timed! Thakur searches for swing and in the process, overcooks this outside off. Stroked sweetly down the ground and beats the diving mid-off fielder with ease"
10169,"FOUR, this is a stunning shot! Wow! Another fuller one and this time, batsman was merely pushing it straight back past the bowler. Such amazing timing and the ball just rocketed away. Signs that this is a much better surface than the eliminator"
10170,"FOUR, pressure telling on Thakur and batsman is ruthless. Harmless short ball that's pulled away through square leg. 'Gabbar' seizing the momentum straightaway"
10171,"FOUR, cracking shot! Tad fuller around off, Iyer brings his bat down in a sweet flow and crunches his drive past the fielder at cover. There was a fielder in the deep to hunt it down but the timing was just about right"
10172,"out Caught by Raina!! Brainfade for the Delhi Capitals skipper. A googly around middle and leg, Iyer goes down in order to slog it but ends up getting a top-edge. The ball skies up towards Raina at point who settles underneath it and takes it safely. team on top, Delhi in trouble. batsman c Raina b bowler 13(18) [4s-1]"
10173,"out Caught by Tahir!! The champion strikes! Time to bring out those moves. That shot looked good for a moment but the lack of pace on it results in batsman's downfall. Was a short one around off and the southpaw guides it straight into the mitts of Imran Tahir at third man. Had there been some more pace on the ball, it would have probably gone the distance. batsman c Tahir b bowler 3(6)"
10174,"leg byes, FOUR, team take a review against batsman! Imran bowler looked excited but the impact looks just outside off, or probably umpire's call. Nope, wait. The impact was in line but the ball was bouncing over the stumps by some distance. batsman was trying to play a drive but got beaten for spin. The ball clips his pads and races away to the fence thereafter. The onfield call stays"
10175,"SIX, just look at that shot! Unbelieveable, reckons Sunny G on air. Was a touch short around off, batsman treks back and lifts it over covers for a lovely six. Class!"
10176,out Caught by Watson!! Bhajji strikes again and brings out his fist pump to celebrate this wicket. batsman plays one shot too many and has to pay the price for it. He had struck a six already and there was no need to go after the offie. Goes hard at it and gets a thick outside edge that flies to short third man. Watto completes the formalities inside the ring. batsman c Watson b bowler 10(12) [6s-1]
10177,"FOUR, controlled aggression from Rishabh batsman! Sits on one knee, picks the legbreak and sweeps it in the gap between deep square and deep mid-wicket"
10178,"SIX, Deepak Chahar catches it......and steps back to ruin the party for team! MSD is not pleased and he immediately brings Chahar into the infield. bowler almost started celebrating, but had to hold back and so are the team fans in the stands. A loopy full delivery outside off, batsman goes for the biggie and slices it high into the air off the cue end, the ball keeps swirling and Chahar at long-on couldn't control his momentum around the boundary ropes. Took the catch cleanly but the momentum way always dragging him back. Big moment in the game?"
10179,"out Bowled!! DJ Bravo gets the better of Keemo Paul. And the GANGNAM is on. 130ks yorker from round the wicket, goes slightly wide of the crease and pins it at the base of leg-stump, Paul looked to hammer it down with a violent bat swing but his leg peg goes cartwheeling; dips under the bat and crashes into the woodwork. batsman b bowler 3(7)"
10180,"out Caught by Dwayne Bravo!! batsman had to go for the big shot and unfortunately for team, he loses balance as one hand comes off the bat. Hits the slog flat and DJ Bravo times his jump to perfection at wide long-on to gobble the catch. batsman c Dwayne Bravo b bowler 38(25) [4s-2 6s-1]"
10181,"FOUR, gets across and picks bowler off his pads over fine leg, clean swing of the bat and timed it to perfection"
10182,"no run, flat and fast on off-stump, batsman forces it straight back at Jaddu who couldn't cling onto a return catch"
10183,"SIX, shortens his length and keeps it around off, batsman stays on the back foot and thrashes it way over long-on"
10184,"out Bowled!! Clever from Jaddu. Bowled the arm-ball and managed to beat the inside edge. batsman expected it to be around off-stump and poked at it without much conviction, the ball dips short of him and smashes the leg bail. batsman b bowler 6(3) [6s-1]"
10185,"FOUR, no spin on this, batsman uses his long levers and muscles it to the left of long-on, Faf tried his best to get behind the ball but batsman, perhaps, timed it too well"
10186,out Lbw!! Excellent review and Shaw has to go! He was looking good once again tonight but falls prey to his addiction for the pull shot. The length wasn't really there on this occasion and he missed it altogether to be hit on the back knee as he crouched a bit. team were confident on the LBW appeal and sent it upstairs after the umpire's rejection. Nothing on UltraEdge and HawkEye shows Three Reds. Good review. batsman lbw b bowler 5(6) [4s-1]
10187,"FOUR, hammered! Clear intent from batsman as he gives the charge and forces this length ball past the bowler. Well wide of mid-on and it speeds away"
10188,"SIX, walks down the pitch and smashes it for a maximum. Just the kind of finish team wanted and the whole of Delhi camp are delighted on seeing batsman Sharma get his highest score in IPL. It was straight and short from Jaddu, batsman ambled down and clobbered it straight back over the bowler's head. Crashed flat into the boundary hoardings..."
10189,"FOUR, 'hit me' ball from bowler and batsman pummels it through the off-side. Slower, shorter and wider as well, gift for any batsman and it gets the treatment. Slapped through point"
10190,out Caught by Dhoni!! Dhoni takes it on the second attempt! Sharp catch as this was a healthy edge and the dangerous batsman has to depart. Was the quicker one and he wanted to essay the back foot cut. Got a thick nick that bobbled up off Dhoni's gloves for a moment and he held on. batsman c Dhoni b bowler 18(14) [4s-3]
10191,"FOUR, crashed away by batsman! Got a bit of width on this turning off break, the length allowed him to wait and he slapped it through cover-point. Sweeper is behind square on the off-side and had no chance"
10192,"FOUR, over the infield! Fuller this time and batsman wisely goes over cover. With the spin and the loft is clean. This stroke should give him confidence"
10193,"out Caught by Dwayne Bravo!! bowler gets rid of the set batsman. batsman was looking so good, until he played this shot. Once again he goes down on his knee to play the sweep shot but fails to keep it on the ground. Dwayne Bravo stationed at deep square leg takes a regulation catch and Delhi sink further. They'll have two new batsmen at the crease now and Imran Tahir is yet to bowl his first over. Interesting passage of play on the cards. batsman c Dwayne Bravo b bowler 27(24) [4s-4]"
10194,"FOUR, there's never a dull moment when batsman is out there. Premeditates yet again and scoops the floated delivery towards fine leg. The fielder was no where close to cut this down, neither inside the circle nor outside it"
10195,"FOUR, that's overpitched and it's gone to the fence in a flash. Du Plessis leans across, right on top of it, before drilling it through the covers"
10196,"FOUR, way too full from Krunal, a half-volley really which batsman pulverizes through the covers. That's too easy, something team can ill afford"
10197,"out Caught by de Kock!! They sense it. Mumbai are gaining the upper hand. This is such brilliant captaincy from Ro. team just lost a wicket and he brings his key bowler back for an over and prises out another. batsman with a very lame attempt to pull/hook this short ball, wasn't going really hard at it, the ball takes the edge and QdK makes no mistake as it grabs the ball with a jump. Big roar for MSD as he walks out. batsman c de Kock b bowler 1(4)"
10198,"FOUR, oh Bumrah! bowler will be livid with him. Bowled so well and he's let this go right through him for four. Would have been a single maximum. But Chahar's got to blame himself in the first place for bowling a freebie down the leg-side, Watto sweeps and gets it through short fine leg"
10199,"out Dhoni Run Out!! 1 run completed. Phew! What drama! team have lost their captain in a big pressure final! This was an overthrow which Dhoni was trying to steal and he will be unhappy with himself for doing something like this in a final. It was a short ball which batsman got the glove on the pull shot, he hit it to Malinga's left and Slinga fired an overthrow at the bowler's end. The ball went only as far as mid-off, but Dhoni tried it take on the fielder but Kishan hit the bulls eye and ignited the stumps. This was a very tough decision to make. One angle showed Dhoni was on the line, but there was another angle which reckoned Dhoni may have just sneaked in. Thoughts of benefit of doubt going to the batsman circled, but Llong took a long time. Saw various different angles and pressed the red button. Dhoni run out (Ishan Kishan) 2(8)"
10200,"no run, oh is that a dropped chance? Yes it was. It's the set Watto. Full delivery on the stumps, batsman drives hard and hits it back at the bowler, who doesn't accept the offer"
10201,"SIX, 138.6kph, misses his yorker and worse - he's got reverse swing on it as well - but it's bang in the slot and Bravo also makes it worse by getting deep in the crease as he whips it uppishly, high and over deep mid-wicket. Hardik doesn't help himself either at the boundary, running in at first, and then having to go back .. watches in the nd"
10202,"FOUR, 138.8kph. Keeps dishing out pace, keeps it wide outside off and batsman's edge will do just as well. There may have been a short third man, but the slice is such that it's very fine"
10203,"FOUR, oh, better. bowler - with more pace - and with more in the slot. Wide, outside off, batsman moves away, sits down on a knee and carves it away into third man, almost all the way too"
10204,"FOUR, it's on loop. 15.3, 15.4 and 15.5, each one predictable perfectly -- all pace dealt out outside off, lots of width too and this time batsman picks out deep extra cover with that usual muscular slash"
10205,"1 run, oh Watto, you four-lifed cat. bowler lines him up perfectly with a sharp nippy bouncer, batsman pulls, gets hurried up big time, gets a top-edge and Rahul Chahar - running in from deep backward square leg wouldn't have had it easier. But alas, it's the finals, he slides, lets it pop out"
10206,"SIX, this was coming, this was exactly what Krunal was gambling again. He flats it wide outside off, there may have been a deep extra cover, but batsman carves it powerfully, well over that guy"
10207,"SIX, it had to be short. It HAD to be given the last ball's treatment, but batsman's smarter, rocking behind, going with a straight punch, extending his followthough into the sightscreen down the ground"
10208,"SIX, well, well, well, it can get cleaner. Krunal's darted this bang into the arc, batsman's down on a knee too and goes slogging. If only boundaries were in the second tier!"
10209,"1 run, squeezed away to the right of point, Ishan does superbly out there, diving, keeping it to onlly a single"
10210,"out Caught by de Kock!! 148.5kph of a brute. It's lethal. It's murderous. bowler keeps the seam up, bangs it some more on his neither-here-nor-there lengths and Bravo continues backing away to have punchy wafts over extra cover at them. But this one's too fiery to not be nicked, and a kiss on the outside splice will do just as fine. Just when you thought things were slipping out, eh!? batsman c de Kock b bowler 15(15) [6s-1]"
10211,"byes, FOUR, oh Quinton .. you may have heard of cups dropped, this is probably the cup misfielded. It was quick, really quick, and going well over the cut, and de Kock, in his quest to throw it quicker and stop the bye, ends up not collecting at all"
10212,"out batsman Run Out!! 1 run completed. Wide yorker. Squeezed away to deep point. But suddenly, for some weird reason batsman then doesn't want the second. Yes. No. Yes. No. And the half-hearted yes without proper consent ends up with him falling short, clearly short. The throw's f;at, which Quinton collects from well behind the stumps and under-arms it onto the stumps. batsman run out (Krunal Pandya/de Kock) 80(59) [4s-8 6s-4]"
10213,"out Lbw!! Slower off-cutter, and things don't dip in the slot any better. 2013. 2015. 2017. 2019, you don't mess with Arithmetic progressions and you don't mess with these mathematical Mumbai Indians. Thakur - poor old Thakur - sent ahead of his usual position - walks across his stumps, freezes bang in front of middle looking to flick it across the line. But again, it's the finals, he chokes, misses and is trapped plumb, bang in front of middle. Oh bowler, you really couldn't have redeemed yourself any better. batsman lbw b bowler 2(2)"
10214,"FOUR, steps outside the leg stump again, Krunal follows him again but he errs with his length this time. It's too full. Du Plessis lofts it over mid-on"
10215,"SIX, over mid-on again, a much cleaner strike. Krunal is drawn towards batsman down the leg-side, and is bashed through the line"
10216,"FOUR, completely unsettling the left-armer here. Backing away, making him change the lines. Krunal doesn't follow him this time, so instead, he gets cut through backward point"
10217,"out Stumped!! Krunal has the final say. He spots batsman's charge early, and yorks him with a quick, wide dart. Animated celebrations from the Mumbai Indians. After the stick he got for most of the over, this was much needed for Krunal. batsman st de Kock b bowler 26(13) [4s-3 6s-1]"
10218,"FOUR, wasn't in control, batsman. Overpitched outside off, he went so hard on the drive that the poise was lost and his bat-face opened up - slicing it uppishly past backward point"
10219,"SIX, drifts on leg-stump with this off-cutter and is swept into the stands. batsman, having picked up the line in a flash, got into a brilliant position there before swinging it over backward square"
10220,"FOUR, finds the gap between backward point and short third man. These are mostly off-cutters from bowler, which explains why third man is up. But this one has enough width on it, so batsman can manufacture the pace with his hands as he cuts"
10221,"no run, batsman given out on the field, but he's reviewed it. He got into a terrible position against a cracking bouncer from bowler, just left his hands up there, and according to umpire Gould it brushed his glove on the way. But there's nothing on Ultra-Edge. However, the third umpire still goes through to check if there's any visible deflection. That's interesting. Still, he can't find much to uphold the onfield call. So the decision will have to be overturned"
10222,"FOUR, wowww! What an off-drive, the strike-rate is up and running again. Very brave from Ro to have mid-off in at this stage, but Watto made full use of this juicy full ball and powered it to the fence"
10223,"2 runs, top edgeeeee, it's Malinga and he isn't stable, doesn't even get a hand on it! team cannot be sloppy in the field. They defended miraculously against team a couple of years ago at this very venue. They need to be sharp now. This was a slower short ball, batsman went for the pull shot and got an edge that went way up in the air, Slinga moved sluggishly to his left from short fine leg and he never judged it properly"
10224,"out Lbw!! batsman's hot and cold season comes to an end with him eating up a review in an all important final when he was absolutely dead in front. Lovely bowling from bowler. Leggie from the leggie, batsman was hanging back to defend, missed the ball, the impact was on the front pad first before it smashed into the back pad. Impact in line with middle and it's hitting the top of middle stump. Mumbai have an opening now. Can they put team under serious pressure? batsman lbw b bowler 8(14)"
10225,"SIX, smashed! A sharp bouncer @139.8km/h, batsman isn't back and across, but natural talent comes to the fore - the frontfoot across and that pulled high in front of deep square leg for six!"
10226,"FOUR, terrific catch from RJ - well, nearly, only he could have got to the ball, ran in a long way from deep mid-wicket, dived across to his left, went one-handed and got to the ball, but it kept going away and bounced past his outstretched hands. Nicely played by Suryakumar, knew that mid-wicket was wide and clipped it high and wide of that fielder - any other fielder and it was an easy boundary"
10227,"FOUR, that has been muscled - Kishan making his intentions clear - fetched a well flighted delivery from outside off and heaved it wide of mid-wicket - the fielder at long-on can't get across in time"
10228,"out Bowled!! bowler is off and running here in Hyderabad - big wicket in the context of the innings, Suryakumar was one who could have anchored this innings for team - the slider from bowler, pitched around off and kept going straight, Suryakumar was perhaps playing for the wrong 'un, made room and pushed limply - with a horizontal bat, the ball grazes the inside edge and bounces through to the middle-stump. batsman b bowler 15(17) [4s-1]"
10229,"out Caught&Bowled!! That's a top-catch from Shardul - he called for the ball, sprinted a long way towards square leg, got to the ball and then juggled it, but doesn't panic - holds onto the second attempt and team have lost their fourth wicket. He's on a roll, the Mumbai speedster. This was a well directed bouncer, short and climbing onto the left-hander, cramped for room, Krunal still went for the pull, gets a big top-edge, high and towards square leg. MS went for the catch, but the bowler called it out and then held on. batsman c and b bowler 7(7)"
10230,"SIX, low full toss, didn't dip on the batter and has been spanked down the ground over the bowler's head for a sixer. batsman didn't hold back there. Mistimed hits from him will carry as well"
10231,"out Caught by Raina!! What have you done mr. Kishan? Was that needed? Tries to go for a big slog sweep against a googly, gets a huge top-edge and Raina takes a dolly at cover. And bowler becomes the leading wicket-taker of the tourney. Is it a game changing moment? Might well be. team fans erupt. batsman c Raina b bowler 23(26) [4s-3]"
10232,"FOUR, Chahar goes for the catch at deep cover and the ball bounces just in front of him to go away to the fence. That was sliced away powerfully and Chahar came charging in only to find the ball dropping right in front of him"
10233,"SIX, you can't drop it that short! Mince meat for batsman. Picks the short ball and slams it over deep square leg for a sixer. Much needed one for team"
10234,"1 run, have you dropped the game Mr. Raina? That was a short ball, batsman mistimes the slap and Raina at cover drops a dolly. Big final and batsman gets a chance!!! team have a huge reprieve"
10235,"SIX, and batsman slams the pull away! Adds a lot of red chilly into the wounds of team. Powered over deep mid for a sixer. That was hugeeeeee"
10236,"SIX, fuller ball and has been whipped away over deep mid. This is what a redemption does to a batter. Frees his arms and helicopters it over deep mid for a sixer. Oh Raina!!"
10237,"FOUR, short ball, batsman stays back and pulls it down to deep mid for a four. Was in the gap between deep mid and long-on. team on a roll post the drop!"
10238,out Lbw!! That dropped chance might not hav cost a lot of runs as Pandya is out LBW. bowler nailed the yorker against a rampaging batsman. batsman looked to whip it staying deep in his crease and missed it. He was given out LBW and challenged it immediately. But it was three reds. And Pandya had to walk off. Excellent thinking on the part of the young man. batsman lbw b bowler 16(10) [4s-1 6s-1]
10239,"bowler to Rahul bowler, out Caught by du Plessis!! bowler gets his younger brother. Length delivery curling away, Rahul bowler looks to go down town and slices the ball away to mid-off. Simple catch for the fielder who accepts it with ease. Pollard couldn't crossover either. team being dented here. Rahul bowler c du Plessis b bowler 0(2)"
10240,out McClenaghan Run Out!! 1 run completed. McClenaghan sacrifices his wicket trying to get batsman back on strike. Was struck down the ground over the bowler's head as another wide yorker was executed. The man at long-off zoomed the throw to the bowler's end for the bowler to whip the bails off. Bravo shows emotions as well and bangs the ball on to the turf after whipping the bails off. McClenaghan run out (du Plessis/bowler) 0(2)
10241,"FOUR, power, brute power! Full, outside off and slammed between deep cover and deep long-off for a four. Whatta shot!!! batsman absolutely drilled that. bowler missed the wide yorker not by much"
10242,"SIX, another lost ball? A length ball, the white marshmallow deceives bowler, as it doesn't move off the wicket, a tad wide outside off, but batsman shuffles across and clubs that high and mighty over cow corner for six! Into the stands!"
10243,"SIX, an away-swinger, nothing wrong with this one, on a good length and not a lot of width, batsman just backs away and has a flash at it - and he's sliced it away over deep backward point for six. Just over Bhajji at the fence"
10244,"SIX, VVS was spot-on with his pitch report, he's definitely trusting the bounce off a length, it's angling away, batsman lines himself and just casually lofts it over deep extra cover for six"
10245,"FOUR, and batsman signs off with a four! An angry batsman walks off. That 'could have been wide ball' playing on his mind. Was fuller, missed the mark though, and batsman butchered it between deep cover and long-off. Sped into the fence in a jiffy"
10246,"FOUR, errs off the final ball - a flat one on the pads, batsman is quick to pounce on it, shapes up to sweep, and nails it to the backward square leg fence for four"
10247,"SIX, short one angling away outside off, batsman plays a southpaw's forehand and absolutely slaughters that over deep mid-wicket for six. That's an absolutely stunning shot..."
10248,"out Caught by Dhoni! Short ball, and that does the trick! Right at the body, really brave bowling, he's hurried on the pull and top-edges it - hardly any bat on that and Dhoni comes around, moves to his right, to take the citter of the century. A huge wicket in the context of the game, and Shardul has taken a key wicket here. batsman c Dhoni b bowler 29(17) [6s-4]"
10249,"out Caught by Dhoni! The slower one has done it! 119.8km/h, the knuckle ball, that wobbles unpredictably in the air, swerves away, courtesy a falling seam towards the on-side, and batsman has been done in by the lack of pace - can't decide when to get his weight forward and has a waft at a transfer-of-weight drive into the off-side - his bottom-hand has come off the bat, no control, and he gets a healthy edge. Dhoni dives forward to pick up the catch that's dipping on him. Both the openers have departed, and team right back in it! batsman c Dhoni b bowler 15(14) [4s-1 6s-1]"
10250,"no run, just short of Raina at cover, dropped short and wide of off, Kishan made room for the punch and didn't bother to keep it down, almost carried to cover as raina tumbled forward"
10251,"FOUR, clubbed, nice way to start after the break, length delivery outside off, Kishan leant forward and lifted it high and over mid-on, almost went all the way, bounced just in front of the ropes"
10252,"FOUR, nicely played, the loopy slower ball from Bravo, kept dipping onto the left-hander - Kishan was setting himself up for the pull, bends down low with the ball and then sweeps it behind square on the on-side - beat the man in the ring and raced away to the ropes"
10253,"FOUR, fetch that! On a full length outside off, shaping away to an extent and batsman throws the kitchen sink at it. Smacks it over extra cover as he's off the mark with a boundary"
10254,"out Lbw!! Sweet vengeance for bowler as he comes back on the very next ball having conceded a boundary. Full, quick and swinging into the batsman. batsman goes for a drive with lack of footwork and gets rapped on the pads. Impact on middle and this would have crashed into middle and leg. Good call by the openers to not opt for the review, else they would have regretted it after watching the replays. batsman lbw b bowler 4(5) [4s-1]"
10255,"SIX, horrible drag down this. batsman's charged down, made it into one in his slot and smoking a cross-batted heave over cow corner"
10256,"FOUR, absolute smash back, tennis forehand. A walk, clearing the front leg and a swat downtown, with bowler getting a fingertip as he tries pulling his hand out of the way. Oh and also, a fifty -- and revenge for the 2019 WC is well and truly complete"
10257,"SIX, oooo, wow. Just wow. batsman continues dancing, going inside-out, and then holding his pose. Yep, extra cover"
10258,"1 run, back of a length, on off. Swatted off the front foot, to a sliding long-on who's Pandya, Hardik Pandya"
10259,"1 run, 142.8kph, yorker, off-lined. Jammed down the ground, coincidentally bringing up the 100-run stand as well"
10260,"FOUR, 144.5kph. Slight width, wth Faf backing away to snatch a lot more to slap this with lots of bottom-hand, past Rohit's dive at short cover"
10261,"1 run, dropped -- a massively tough one, but nevertheless, it's put down. batsman reverse-sweeps, and Krunal Pandya - backward point - dives to his right, gets both palms, and can't hold on"
10262,"out Caught&Bowled!! Nobody's taking his catches, and so what if he needs to sprint backwards for this. Yeah, he does. batsman, third time unlucky, has a dance, a hoick, only getting the toe-end and skewing up a skier. It's somewhere around mid-on, and the run-dive's more than good enough. But forget that, it's been a top knock from India's best number four who wasn't in the World Cup. batsman c and b bowler 71(48) [4s-6 6s-3]"
10263,"FOUR, filthy loose a line. Full, leg-lined and batsman just waits for it to get close before whipping it really fine"
10264,"FOUR, nothing dicey here. bowler feeds him a high full toss outside off and batsman neatly opens his bat face to carve it backward of point"
10265,"out Lbw!! Plumb. Dead. Gone. A straight delivery, angling in and the batsman's been fooled by the pace as he plays all around this with his flick after plonking his front leg in front of off. It can't get easier for umpires, and for batsman with the decision to not review. batsman lbw b bowler 10(5) [4s-2]"
10266,"SIX, low full toss. Curran stays crouched, gets under, and boom. Swinging slog, into cow corner"
10267,"FOUR, there's nobody in the deep on the off-side, but Pandya for some reason still wants to bowl a half-tracker with lots of width. Curran won't complain, slicing it over cover, which is all he had to do"
10268,"SIX, game over. bowler tries the slower one, but Curran - in some mood - picks it early and nails it right off the screws, over deep mid-wicket"
10269,"out Caught by Pattinson!! Misbah moment? A scoop, after shuffling across to a slower delivery, but unlike Sreesanth, Pattinson has to backpedal and hold on. Doesn't matter, this game's sealed. batsman c Pattinson b bowler 18(6) [4s-1 6s-2]"
10270,"FOUR, sealed some more. Another poor delivery, slow, short, wide. Faf has all the time he needs, staying up tall and slicing over cover in the ring with nobody behind"
10271,"1 run, a sort of a miscued punch, wide of extra cover, but nothing's miscued in this fifty"
10272,"no run, batsman reviews a caught behind: You'd think when he reviews from behind the stumps, he'd know when he hasn't nicked it. It was the typical strategy -- short, incoming bouncer, which MS pulls and apparently gloves away to the keeper. Nope, clear daylight between glove and ball, and more daylight between bat and ball. But there was a noise, which probably was his clicking bat"
10273,"FOUR, sliced over point. bowler goes round the wicket and dishes out a floaty lazy non-warmed-up delivery that's full, wide and worthy of a dispatch. Yep, over backward"
10274,"FOUR, no fuss. bowler overcompensates with one that's short, into the body and gets swiped into deep mid-wicket. Again, no fuss, not even a celebration. Typical dad stuff, you're never happy, and that's exactly what this team are"
10275,"out Lbw!! Gone this time! Faf du Plessis was asking him to opt for the review, but batsman thinks otherwise and decides to walk back. This one shaped into the batsman on a fullish length and beat batsman's across-the-line flick. Struck in front of middle, but looking at the replays, I think it might have clipped or probably missed the leg stump. batsman lbw b bowler 1(7)"
10276,"FOUR, that shall release some nerves in the team camp. Pitched on a full length outside off, batsman reaches out for it by leaning ahead and creams it through extra cover as the ball races away in no time"
10277,"FOUR, swinging like the pendulum of a clock already, this innings. Back of a length delivery outside off, width on offer and batsman has thumped it through cover-point with authority. No need to run for those"
10278,"FOUR, quality shot! Typical batsman as he leans forward, converts the length into a slight full one and creams it through the gap on the off side. Looks batting look so effortless"
10279,"SIX, that will hurt. The free-hit has gone the distance as batsman lines up against the short ball and clubs it off the back foot over wide long-on. Sweetly timed maximum. Started with four dot balls and ends up conceding 14. Life's harsh sometimes"
10280,"no ball, FOUR, slashed away! Not that short, neither too full. Sets up for batsman who makes use of the slight width and flashes it over point. No ball. Free hit coming!"
10281,"FOUR, fantastic Faf! All about timing, this shot. Shimmies down the track and although the ball sticks into the surface - the class of batsman takes over. Goes inside out with a checked lofted drive and manages to beat Surya at long-off"
10282,"1 run, was that a dropped catch? batsman was down the track to play an uppish flick as Chahar failed to grab it although he put in a dive. It escaped him as he couldn't quite reach there"
10283,"1 run, 50-run stand up as batsman eases it down to long-off for a gentle single"
10284,"FOUR, not a great effort by Bumrah at short fine leg, he should have stopped this. Was down the leg side as batsman swept it past the man at short fine leg"
10285,"FOUR, back-to-back sloppy efforts. A tossed up delivery outside off and batsman chips it to deep cover where Boult makes a mess of it. Was charging in to avoid the batsmen from taking the second, and ends up gifting them a boundary. Rohit Sharma wouldn't be a happy skipper with those two boundaries.."
10286,"FOUR, there is swing alright, but it's an absolute loosener. Sitting up from a back of a length outside off, gets whacked through covers. batsman is underway in IPL 2020. Stood there in the crease and nonchalantly drove it on the back foot"
10287,"FOUR, been a rusty start from bowler, who now doles out a half-volley on the pads of batsman. Gleefully flicked through midwicket, the timing is superb"
10288,"FOUR, plenty of width outside off, the hard part for batsman is to stretch out to meet it. So it's commendable that his timing is still so great as he smears it through backward point"
10289,"out Caught by Sam Curran!! In the airrr, has he timed this? No pace on the ball, to be honest can't blame the pitch for this dismissal. Was right in the slot to tee off, but Suryakumar was hanging back for this one, didn't go through fully and sort of chipped it, long-on steadies and takes this around his left shoulder. batsman c Sam Curran b bowler 17(16) [4s-2]"
10290,"SIX, that's all the amount of respect Pandya had in the tank. He loves spin. As soon as bowler bowled a little full, he went down on his knees to power it over deep mid-wicket"
10291,"SIX, now that is some shot! Don't think many would hit that so far from that length. Not really short and leg stump line, but went back, despite not using the depth of the crease and being cramped, he swivelled and pulled it over the backward square leg boundary and that seems to have cleared the ground. All those gym sessions, that's great flexibility"
10292,"FOUR, shortish and Tiwary has pulled. This is a seriously good cameo from Tiwary. Came in at the fall of two big wickets, but kept the shots coming. This one's pulled over mid-wicket"
10293,"FOUR, oh Lungi! He's the old fit self that he is. The rhythm isn't there, the strides aren't intense. Full delivery, Tiwary charges and slaps wide of mid-off. Can't be bowling full with mid-off in"
10294,"no run, team review for LBW, but looks like it was missing off stump, or maximum shaving off stump. Umpire's call will do for the batsman. Was the googly, so tough to be out LBW from over the wicket, oh yes, ball-tracker says missing off stump. Tiwary went for the big sweep and missed"
10295,"out Caught by du Plessis!! Faf and his magic at the boundary. Those spring ankles take over. Tiwary powered this flighted delivery down the ground, but Faf, very mindful of the boundary, jumped, landed on the left foot, released the ball as he was about to cross the boundary as he was overbalancing. Then quickly recovered to pouch it safely. A really handy innings from Tiwary. He's impressed for sure! batsman c du Plessis b bowler 42(31) [4s-3 6s-1]"
10296,"out Caught by du Plessis!! You are kidding me Faf! Surely you can't be taking these nimble footed catches twice in an over. bowler bowled full, so Pandya went for a loft over long-off, hit it really flat and hard, Faf had to move to his right a bit this time, yet he timed the jump brilliantly, released the ball as he was going over the rope and then swallowed it again. Big wicket this for team, will make a difference of 10 runs at least to the final total. batsman c du Plessis b bowler 14(10) [6s-2]"
10297,"SIX, na, na, na, just waited for it to land in his zone. With that sort of a form in CPL, he won't mishit those. Easy to the eye straight loft into the sightscreen. Expect the bowler to push it quick and short?"
10298,"out Caught by Dhoni!! That's a soft dismissal! Nothing back of a length delivery down leg, Krunal tried to glance fine, but got an edge and Dhoni was sharp moving to his right and grabbing that. Unlucky! Krunal started walking before the decision. Can team stage a comeback and stall team? batsman c Dhoni b bowler 3(3)"
10299,"FOUR, batsman powers this down the ground, no long-off so it runs off to the boundary. bowler overpitched this one and got punished"
10300,"FOUR, this is really poor bowling! Low full toss down leg, batsman flicks, fine leg in, it's a sin to bowl there. batsman calmly glances knowing the field and collects four"
10301,"out Caught by Dhoni!! Edged and taken. All those bowlers in the CPL, hope you note this length. Back of a length is the toughest to hit. If you have pace, it's a no brainer for you to use at the death to power-hitters than bowling freebies in the name of trying the fancied yorker, for which the margin of error is very less. batsman slogs and gets a thick outside edge through to Dhoni. team have stolen 10 runs off the total. batsman c Dhoni b bowler 18(14) [4s-1 6s-1]"
10302,"FOUR, oh Chahar! Dhoni won't be happy with that effort. Short of a length delivery on the stumps, batsman pullls through mid-wicket, what should have been maximum two is now four because Chahar didn't bend enough. The eternal fast bowler's problem! I know!"
10303,"out Caught by du Plessis!! Catch numer three for Faf and wicket number three for bowler. What a turnaround this has been from him. 29 in the first two overs, now has three. Sticks this back of a length delivery into the pitch, a brilliant option on slow surfaces, batsman looks to pull, high in the air and Faf has it easy. batsman c du Plessis b bowler 11(8) [4s-2]"
10304,"out Bowled!! Leg stump out of the ground. Length delivery on the leg stump, batsman slogs and misses. Oh bowler is limping after delivering that ball. Looks like the hammie. He's stretching it. Hope it's not too serious as he wants to continue. batsman b bowler 0(1)"
10305,"FOUR, slower ball at 119kph, sits up for batsman from the middle of the pitch as he heaves through midwicket. bowler's not been great here at the start"
10306,"FOUR, full in the slot for batsman who pumps it over mid-off. Really taking the bowling on, although the bowling is really ordinary at this stage"
10307,"FOUR, four more for batsman, although this has come off a perfectly decent delivery. Back of a length at the top of off, and it's been met with disdain from batsman who clears his front leg and slogs it over mid-on. Almost went all the way"
10308,"FOUR, he's on an absolute roll. Succeeds with the scoop this time, something which he was trying earlier in the over. Walks across, gets a length ball and ramps it over short fine"
10309,"out Caught by Sam Curran!! Such a soft dismissal as batsman just chips this into the hands of mid-off. Half-hearted loft, never went through with it and to make it worse the timing isn't there at all. Bounces off the toe-end and it's a dolly for Curran. The team captain gone early. batsman c Sam Curran b bowler 12(10) [4s-2]"
10310,"out Caught by Watson!! Okay, the slowness of the surface is really coming to the fore here. After Rohit, batsman toe-ends one. And it elicits a mighty roar from Ngidi who took some punishment from the left-hander. Back of a length around off, stops on batsman as he heaves it straight to midwicket. Curran might've rolled his fingers across it as well. batsman c Watson b bowler 33(20) [4s-5]"
10311,"2 runs, full on middle and leg, clipped through midwicket. Raises fifty for team"
10312,"FOUR, beautiful from Suryakumar as he clears the front leg and lifts this delivery over extra cover. Great timing on it to beat long-off"
10313,"FOUR, back of a length, cutting away across off. There should've been no room for Suryakumar here, but he's manufactured it for himself by stepping away. But even from his modified position, the width isn't quite there to free the arms. Still, he's able to scythe this through baclward point. Beats third man's diving effort"
10314,"SIX, bowler gets it right into the slot for Tiwary who lofts it downwind to clear long-off. The wind was the key here. Don't think he struck it that well but the wind made sure it carried"
10315,"FOUR, short enough and wide enough, slapped away for four through backward point. team regaining momentum through these two again"
10316,"FOUR, edged and four, full and angling across the right-hander, Shaw saw the width and went hard on the drive, gets a thick edge that flies through the vacant slip region - a desperate dive from Sarfaraz near the third man rope, but he can only palm it to the ropes"
10317,"out batsman Run Out!! A poor dismissal for the Capitals and batsman walks back for a duck. He might have actually been reprieved first up, think he gloved the pull and KL spilled it - the ball rolled wide of him and batsman thought there was a single on offer - dashed way down the track only to watch his partner motionless at the other end. Too late to return, KL ran across, collected the ball and lobbed in a throw at the striker's end - Gowtham was waiting for it and breaks the stumps, with a disconsolate batsman stranded in the middle. batsman run out (Rahul/Gowtham ) 0(2)"
10318,"1 run, short, skidding on outside off. batsman crashes it through cover"
10319,"FOUR, 89.3kph, the googly spinning away across the left-hander outside off. batsman swings hard, balance out of sync and elicits a thick outside edge which flies through the vacant slip region. Bishnoi has his hands on his head.. lucky batsman"
10320,"1 run, slants it away outside off, slapped away to sweeper cover and 50-run stand between these two"
10321,"SIX, see-ball, hit-ball. As simple as that. Iyer finds one in his arc, brings those strong muscle power and butchers it over long-off. Second six for team's skipper.."
10322,"SIX, whoa.. Iyer, you beauty. This lad is a very good player against spin and he's showing his class here. bowler doesn't correct his length, floats it up just outside off and Iyer's eyes lit up once more. Gets under it and whacks it a mile over long-on"
10323,"FOUR, batsman gets into the act now. Bishnoi pitches it teasingly just outside off, batsman bends low and goes for a cross-batted down-town swing. Picks the gap at long-on and it's a boundary.."
10324,"out Bowled!! Maiden IPL wicket for bowler. Nice comeback, young man. Long way to go! Bowls the wrong 'un, gets it to spin away outside off. batsman tries to do an encore, didn't sort of get into a good position and morever had to fetch it from outside off. Ends up dragging it onto the stumps via an inside edge. Bishnoi is upbeat and a crucial wicket for Punjab as batsman - the dangerman departs. batsman b bowler 31(29) [4s-4]"
10325,"out Caught by Jordan!! One brings two as they say. Two wickets in two overs for Punjab and both set batsmen back in shed for Delhi. Not a wise shot from Iyer at this stage. It was fuller just outside off, Iyer knew the mid-off was inside the ring, so got tempted and wanted to lift it over him. But his bat turns in his hands at the point of impact and as a result of which he miscues and offers a dolly to Jordan. Third wicket for bowler, brilliant. batsman c Jordan b bowler 39(32) [6s-3]"
10326,"out Caught by Rahul!! Has this been taken? KL and bowler are ready to celebrate but umpire Nitin Menon pauses them, he isn't sure if the catch is clean. So, they are referring it to the third umpire. batsman is also asked to wait. No doubt about the glove, it's all about the catch. It's dipping on the way to Rahul and seems like he's grabbed it cleanly. OUT is the decision and the batsman can continue his walk back to the hut. Delhi are falling away quickly. A back of a length, veering down leg. Patel wanted to tickle it fine and he ended up gloving it to KLR, who went to his right and took a good low catch. batsman c Rahul b bowler 6(9)"
10327,"1 run, pacy fuller length delivery at 136.2kph, batsman meets it with a crisp drive to sweeper cover and brings up Delhi's 100"
10328,"SIX, muscled over cow corner. A 92-metre hit from batsman. Got the required length from bowler, who perhaps missed his yorker and batsman punishes it with a massive strike, sending into the empty second tier"
10329,"FOUR, uff! How did batsman manage to get some bat on this? A fast low full toss, batsman gives everything at it and it brushes the inside edge, beats the man at short fine leg. Had he missed it, he would've caught plumb in front. team knew how close it was.. sigh!"
10330,"FOUR, bullied past mid-off. batsman is the designated finisher for team and he's playing a gem here. Takes toll of this overpitched delivery outside off and places it perfectly in the gap"
10331,"FOUR, back-to-back fours for batsman. This is a well-calculated shot. Just got inside the line of this slower ball and helped it over short fine leg's head disdainfully. Fantastic start to the 19th over for Delhi"
10332,"FOUR, third boundary of the over and KL Rahul immediately walks up to have a chat with the bowler. A juicy low full toss outside off, batsman with fast hands hammers it powerfully square on the off-side and threads the gap"
10333,"out Caught by Shami!! There's the salute as bowler gets a wicket off his final ball. Went for the short delivery and it worked for him. batsman hopped back, opened his bat face and flayed it up in the air to third man. Couldn't find the distance and Shami pouches it comfortably. batsman had the licence to go for the kill, but eish.. batsman c Shami b bowler 4(6)"
10334,"SIX, wow! batsman is on fire here. He's raced to 34 off just 16 balls. bowler serves it fuller and on middle, batsman moves across and wallops it over deep square leg."
10335,"FOUR, edged and four. team and batsman won't mind how the runs come at this stage. Shortish outside off, batsman goes for the cut with horizontal bat and gets an outside edge which travels in a jiffy to the third man fence"
10336,"FOUR, four more to batsman! bowler trusts his instincts and tries the yorker, misses it by a few inches and batsman, in this form, won't miss out. Whips it off his pads behind square and collects another boundary"
10337,"FOUR, hat-trick of fours here. Raining boundaries. bowler shifts his line outside off, batsman with a bent knee reaches out and drills it over extra cover"
10338,"SIX, 20-ball fifty for batsman. Rabada congratulates and his mates in the dressing room are delighted. batsman raises his bat and soaks in all the applause. bowler struggles again, keeps missing his length and gets punished once again. batsman takes it on the full and dispatches it into the deep mid-wicket stands"
10339,"1 run, chance and Gowtham can't hold on - a lively start in Dubai, banged in short and angling across the left-hander, batsman was in no position on the pull, gets a fat top-edge that goes high and over square leg. Gowtham circled around it, he wasn't balanced as he positioned himself, did get both hands and can't hold on"
10340,"no ball, out batsman Run Out!! 1 run completed. Short of a length delivery outside off, batsman carved it towards sweeper cover, there was never a second run but considering it was the final ball, he just put his head down and raced back for the second. Clean pick and throw from Pooran to the keeper, batsman is run-out by a countrymile. Okay, so, it's a no-ball. One more ball left, officially. batsman run out (Pooran/Rahul) 53(21) [4s-7 6s-3]"
10341,"out Caught by Jordan!! This is a reckless start from the Capitals - short of a good length and well wide of off, not the length to be attempting the pull - Shaw goes for it, gets it low off the bat and it spoons high and towards mid-on. Jordan is the man under it and you don't expect him to drop those. Number two for the Kings and no wonder their management and owners look thrilled. batsman c Jordan b bowler 5(9) [4s-1]"
10342,"FOUR, cracking shot, too short from bowler, batsman swivels across, doesn't bother to keep it down and pulls it over square leg, one bounce and over the ropes - a shot of real authority"
10343,"out Caught by Agarwal!! This is turning out to be a awful start for the Capitals - another soft dismissal and bowler is on cloud nine. He shortened his length and got one to angle across the left-hander, batsman was looking to work it to the on-side, closed the bat-face early and the front-edge looped straight into the grateful hands of Mayank at extra-cover. As simple as it gets and the Capitals have been reduced to 13 for 3. batsman c Agarwal b bowler 7(13) [4s-1]"
10344,"FOUR, short, wide and four, width on offer and batsman is all over it like a rash - gets on top of the bounce and clatters it square past backward point for a boundary"
10345,"FOUR, this was coming - batsman can't be kept quiet any longer, bends down low and plays a pick-up sweep over backward square leg, almost went all the way, bounced just in front of the ropes"
10346,"SIX, massive, too full from KG, right under Shreyas's arc and he doesn't let that go unpunished - gets forward and thumps it high and over long-on, went into the top tier for a 99m hit"
10347,"leg byes, FOUR, pace can be your ally sometimes and it can be your enemy too! bowler bowls it at 146ks but spills it down leg and batsman manages to get some thingh pad as he misses the flick. Races away..."
10348,"SIX, bread and butter for KL batsman! On the pads and a real loosener that from bowler, lines it up perfectly and swats it into the mid-wicket stands"
10349,"out Caught by Prithvi Shaw!! The pressure gets to Sarfaraz and he holes out to long-on. Advances and tries to dispatch bowler Patel over long-on, but the connection ain't sweet and he could only skew up a bottom edge to Shaw at long-on. Half the side back in the hut at the half-way stage. batsman c Prithvi Shaw b bowler 12(12) [4s-2]"
10350,"SIX, gets one out of the screws, finally! Gets into position early against the short ball and hammers the pull flat into the mid-wicket stands"
10351,"FOUR, 142.9km/h, short and marginally wide, batsman can just hang back and carves that away to the deep backward point fence for four!"
10352,"FOUR, back of a length ball that skids a little lower than true, and batsman opens the face to steer it away to third man for four! A composed shot!"
10353,"SIX, rank length ball, released off the knuckles, a massive no-no at this point, and he's carted that over long-on for six!"
10354,"FOUR, is this the over? Just a glimmer of width on that short one, and batsman hops, slaps it away through the gap to deep extra cover for four! Incredible shot!"
10355,"2 runs, he's taken two catches today, but he drops this one running backwards! Gets under the short ball, hooks, gets a bit of a top-edge towards midwicket, Prithvi is running backwards and dives - and that just pops out of his hands!"
10356,"out Caught by Pant! That's a shot of panic, and lack of faith in his technique. 142.7km/h of oomph on that one, batsman backs away and tries to use the pace, attempting to steer it away towards the third man area - gets a feather of a top-edge to Pant who holds onto the simplest of catches! More pressure on Agarwal now! batsman c Pant b bowler 20(14) [4s-1 6s-1]"
10357,"FOUR, backs away and clubs this one cross-batted to the long-off boundary for four! Good start for batsman here..."
10358,"FOUR, 110.4km/h slower one on a length with a bit of width, batsman waits on it and unleashes the wrists - runs his hands through the slap through sweeper cover for four as Axar fails to cut it off with a dive..."
10359,"SIX, that's a start to the over, and the pressure is right back on the bowler now! Full and wide, and he gets on his knee to slice this over deep backward point for six! Fifty for batsman, and this may well be a coming-of-age story in Dubai tonight, as he raises his bat..."
10360,"SIX, he's picked the bones out of the slower one, and it's clear why - 75.5km/h, off the back of the hand, and it was so slow, he could have swung once and swung it again in time. Decides to wait, and clubs this over long-off for six!"
10361,"FOUR, misses the length by a mere few inches, batsman gets under it and slams this straight down the ground for four! Incredible!"
10362,"FOUR, it's all happening for the Kings XI Punjab, a miscue, a steepling top-edge and Iyer off all people has made a mess of it. Could this be the pivotal moment of the game? Banged in short and Mayank got into a poor position on the pull, was cramped for room and all he managed was a thick leading edge over mid-wicket, went high and down towards the rope. Iyer came running across from the deep, did all the hard yards, got both hands and let it burst through - to add insult to injury, it rolled over the ropes"
10363,"SIX, 13 off 6, and he's slammed the first ball of the final over for six! Far too slow to bother him, and he's nailed this loft over his head for for six!"
10364,"FOUR, scores level! This is his night! Backs away and picks this up from leg-stump, opens the face and flays this between perfectly through the gap in the extra cover region for four! A dive at the boundary, but that won't save the boundary..."
10365,"out Caught by Hetmyer! The agony! It was a full-toss, just a moment too less for Mayank to process this, flays this on account of the width, trying to slice this over deep backward point for six, but ends up finding the ONE fielder at the boundary - Hetmyer. Screams at the heavens for snatching this moment away from him, but he has only himself to blame, does Mayank. Just hasn't managed to finish this off! batsman c Hetmyer b bowler 89(60) [4s-7 6s-4]"
10366,"out Caught by Rabada! It's a super-over! A full-toss on the leg-stump, and he's flicked this straight to Rabada at short square leg, who holds on! A nightmare start to the over, from bowler, and he's managed to bring it to a tie. NOW NOW! batsman c Rabada b bowler 5(6)"
10367,"FOUR, 141ks garnered with a hint of width, batsman feasts on it with a smacking cut past the diving left hand of backward point"
10368,"FOUR, 145ks short and moving away, batsman opens the bat slightly and guides it to the left of Rabada at third man who half-stops, but eventually lets it sneak through his palms"
10369,"out Bowled!! First breakthrough for team and it's a big one. batsman chops this onto his stumps. A 134.2ks inswinger from bowler, managed to pitch it on a good length and that sharp inward movement meant batsman played it slightly outside the line of the delivery (he was trying to flick on the leg-side) and the timber's been rattled. Takes the inside edge and hammers the woodwork. batsman b bowler 21(19) [4s-2 6s-1]"
10370,"out Caught by Prithvi Shaw!! A wicket off his first delivery against his former side for Ravi bowler. Loops it up teasingly and lures batsman into a big hoick on the leg-side, poor connection and he top-edges it high into the night sky. Prithvi Shaw at short fine had ample time to settle under it. batsman c Prithvi Shaw b bowler 1(3)"
10371,"out Bowled!! Got him and bowler has two in five balls. What a sweet revenge for the former team skipper. Tosses this around middle and leg and gets it to rip sharply off the surface, batsman was leaning forward but wasn't ready to counter the extra bounce as it kisses the pad before hitting the top of off. Left-handers against off-spin will always be a challenge and wasn't long ago we witnessed team send a left-hander against left-arm spin. Tactics, strategies...ah! What do the data analysts know? batsman b bowler 0(3)"
10372,"out Caught by Shreyas Iyer!! Not falling short this time around, Shreyas Iyer has his bucket hands wrapped around the dolly of a catch. Honestly, it's catching practice! batsman once again is early into his shot as he tries to loft the 144.2ks delivery over long-off. Doesn't get anywhere near the middle and Iyer does the rest. batsman c Shreyas Iyer b bowler 1(4)"
10373,"FOUR, edged and it flies between keeper and slip! Sarfaraz pokes at this pacy good length delivery and the edge flies past the diving right hand of Pant. The slip was a little late to dive to his left, but its well past him before he could react"
10374,"FOUR, lack of pace but it's a half-volley outside off! Sarfaraz leans onto the front foot and spanks the drive wide of the sliding fielder (to his left) at mid-off"
10375,"FOUR, first signs of audacity. Keep them coming young man! Sandeep bowls the away swinger but it's a half tracker, Padikkal confidently chipped down the track and pulled over wide mid-on"
10376,"FOUR, with Bhuvi maintaining pressure, it's important bowler backs up but he's spraying the ball around looking for that perfect outswinger starting outside leg and ending off stump, this leg-side freebie flicked wide of short fine leg for four"
10377,"2 runs, mindlessly slogged .. and then more mindlessness in the catch-calling. Well, we;;. Padikkal looks to heave this across the line somewhere into mid-wicket, uppishly, gets the top-edge, gets it to backward square leg, where both other legs - deep square and fine - run, collide, crash into each other, and drop"
10378,"out Bowled!! Yep, another aimless heave and the inside-edge doesn't need fielders to catch it; it takes care of crashing it the stumps. So Padikkal didn't quite want to be playing sensibly anymore and not-find the boundaries with Kohli and AB sitting inside. And he clears out his front leg, swings big, and misses it completely. He swung so hard that his top hand slipped off the handle as well. batsman b bowler 56(42) [4s-8]"
10379,"out Lbw!! Oh plumb. A harmless straight delivery, on a length, on middle and not really turning either. batsman sweeps, or at least tries to. And misses big time to find himself trapped, dead. batsman lbw b bowler 29(27) [4s-1 6s-2]"
10380,"1 run, another flick, no fuss, no risk, mid-wicket"
10381,"FOUR, 137.9kph, dishes out pace, dishes out width, dishes out room with that over the wicket angle. AB slices over sweeper, something he could've done in his sleep"
10382,"out Caught by Rashid Khan !! It's a thing with batsman and the left-arm angle going across. This time it's no poke though, it's a slog in an innings that was looking for a step-up gear. So he tries to take on the longest boundary he has - cow corner - and he does it against Natarajan's slower cutter. It didn't sound bad or miscued in the way he connected, but, no, this is no anti-gravity Chinnaswamy; it's a sea-level Dubai. Long-on's there, inside the ropes. batsman c Rashid Khan b bowler 14(13)"
10383,"FOUR, bang in the slog, at pace .. and AB's already crouches under as he waits and smokes this over cow corner"
10384,"FOUR, 122.5kph, swings through the line, clearing his front leg, plonking in front and then slamming it straight down. Sure, it was in the slot, but still, murderous .."
10385,"SIX, carves it over extra cover. AB waits patiently now, it's another one of Sharma's slower balls that sits up on a length. And boom, and the virus has saved someone in the crowd from a broken nose"
10386,"SIX, width again. Sharma doesn't bother changing his approach, something AB's read well in advance to slap over point this time"
10387,"FOUR, wow. Just murder. Just AB things. Plonks in front, gives his arms the room to swing and then tonks this straight down, nearly all the way"
10388,"2 runs, slices through extra cover, damn cleanly. And fifty - the second-best in this game"
10389,"out batsman Run Out!! 1 run completed. Drilled through the covers again, and flies full-length in trying to get back in for the second as well. But Manish's throw is flat, bang on top of the stumps. Yea, he's an AB on the field. batsman run out (Manish Pandey/Bairstow) 51(30) [4s-4 6s-2]"
10390,"FOUR, horrible wide delivery, the freebies will come with time. Padikkal had to really reach out, all he did was just put bat on ball and find the middle, slapped wide of cover and it teases the fielders"
10391,"out batsman Run Out!! Just top skills. The field was set for a yorker -- long-off, long-on, deep mid-wicket. But Kumar does the double bluff, going for the quick bouncer. Dube meanwhile had himself committed to his front foot, and by the time he can rock back and look to pull, has the ball going over comfortably. Anyway, then he decides to step out for the single and doesn't even bother getting back in after getting nothing from Philippe as Bairstow runs to the stumps to whip the bails off. Okay, 163 then .. batsman run out (Bairstow) 7(8)"
10392,"FOUR, stylish swivel pull, more towards finding the gap wide of deep square leg. Shortish and on the leg stump, Padikkal creams that nicely again"
10393,"FOUR, the overcorrection. Too full, in the slot and Padikkal is a high quality batsman who won't miss out on those. Natarajan went for swing but it didn't and he went to the deep cover boundary on the bounce"
10394,"FOUR, he's a tall bloke and he's managing to pull not really short deliveries quite easily. Short of a length, Padikkal stays in the crease and lofts over mid-wicket"
10395,"FOUR, what's the point of bowl a full ball in the slot with a new ball if you are not a swing bowler? This just came so slowly, Padikkal said thank you very much and smoked it over the bowler's head. Oh team are loving this!"
10396,"no ball, SIX, he's just landed this in the slot for him to power it over mid-wicket. A lot of height on that one and it cleared the fielder in the deep. Oh he's overstepped again! What are you doing bowler!"
10397,"2 runs, full and down leg, clipped behind square, couple of runs and that's the fifty partnership"
10398,"FOUR, too short and batsman did well to get under that and thump it over the leaping fielder at mid-wicket to take pressure off after those dots"
10399,"SIX, bowler goes full and batsman slog-sweeps behind square, bowler was doing alright bowling the hard length, batsman wins the battle"
10400,"FOUR, in the airrrr, oh he's misjudged the catch. Rashid Khan, a fine fielder, the culprit there. But Padikkal deserves this bit of luck. Fifty on debut. What a start. Can't imagine Kohli's emotions right now. He would be really excited. Flighted delivery on the stumps, the slog-sweep behind square, Rashid attacked the bat as it was hit flat, but he realised it was going over, so put the brakes and tried to go back but slipped and the outstretched arm wasn't long enough. Kohli stands and applauds as Padikkal raises the bat"
10401,"FOUR, smokes this half-volley through extra cover to get the chase up and running. No great footwork, there didn't need to be as the hands are good enough for a delivery right in the slot"
10402,"FOUR, this is filth. Juicy half-volley on the pads, flicked away past fine leg"
10403,"SIX, more filth from Umesh. This is an awful start. Short of length at the body, sitting up for batsman who helps the pull behind square and helps it over the ropes. Great timing"
10404,"out Warner Run Out!! This is so unlucky. Warner is run out at the non-striker's end off a delivery that was smashed back by batsman. Another ordinary delivery that's pitched right up, it's hammered back down the ground but Umesh somehow gets a hand and deflects it onto the stumps. What a massive wicket in the middle of an over that's been dreadful up until this point. Redemption for Umesh I guess. team certainly see it that way. Warner run out (bowler) 6(6) [4s-1]"
10405,"2 runs, dropped! How costly is that going to prove? A very full delivery from bowler and batsman toe-ended the biff-drive towards Finch at extra cover who looks to reverse cup, but ended up letting it through. Could be the pace which ensured it burst through his fingers"
10406,"byes, FOUR, looked like the googly and batsman threw everything at it. Loses shape and fails to make contact, the ball sneaks past the inside edge and races past the keeper in a hurry"
10407,"no run, the keeper got excited as soon as he caught the ball and that induced a review from Kohli. Big legbreak from bowler and Pandey looked to flay it flat on the off-side, misses it by a whisker and there was a slightest bit of deviation after pitching which got team excited"
10408,"out Caught by Navdeep Saini!! Gets him this time! bowler once again lures batsman with the flight and the attempted loft doesn't find the middle, skews it off the bottom half of the bat and offers catching practice to the fielder at long-off. More pressure on Bairstow now... batsman c Navdeep Saini b bowler 34(33) [4s-3 6s-1]"
10409,"2 runs, a chance missed and a huge one at that! It's batsman and it's Steyn who's dropped a skier. A sharp bouncer that batsman top-edges and Steyn, at fine leg, circles under it and doesn't even get a fingernail. Well, he's claiming he's lost it in the lights"
10410,"FOUR, that's brute power from Jonny batsman! Just stands tall and murders the short ball with a flat pull over mid-wicket, the fielder in the deep tries to dive but couldn't get anything on it"
10411,"FOUR. DO NOT BOWL FULL TO Jonny batsman. NEVER! He just eases into the drive so casually and all he needed to do was pierce the gap which he did with supreme perfection, past the diving left hand of extra cover and the pace on the ball takes care of the rest"
10412,"FOUR, superb batting this from batsman! Waits for the full delivery to land and just opens the bat face at the last instant to send it between the keeper and short third. Deft!"
10413,"1 run, dropped! It's Padikkal and it's a real toughie. A flat pull from Jonny batsman and Dev dives full length to his left after sprinting forward but couldn't quite get the control over the catch"
10414,"FOUR, short and there's just enough pace for batsman who belts the pull and the best part about this shot is: He made sure he picked the gap to perfection, right between deep square and deep mid-wicket"
10415,"out Bowled!! There's the wicket and there's the man for team. Kohli is absolutely pumped and rightly so. Must say it's a poor shot from batsman. The leggie from bowler and batsman looked to send it to mars with a I-do-not-care-one-bit heave-ho on the leg-side, the flight and lack of pace meant batsman couldn't get under it and the leg peg has been shattered. Brave from bowler to toss it up and invite the big hit. batsman b bowler 61(43) [4s-6 6s-2]"
10416,"out Bowled!! bowler is on a hat-trick! The googly and it has gone right through the gate. A huge forward stride from Vijay batsman, but he clearly misread the delivery there and played for the leg-break, not to be. It's team's game now and team will need some magic if they are to pull it off from here. batsman b bowler 0(1)"
10417,"FOUR, nice shot from batsman! Targets straight boundary and hits it with a neat lofty drive down the ground, picked the full delivery around off and lifted it with ease. That is a really crucial boundary. Kohli talking to bowler about that ball, looks like he's telling bowler that he should've been defensive. Because these are two young players at the crease, may find it difficult against Steyn. Four vital runs given away. Credit to Sharma for smoking it"
10418,"out Bowled!! Talk about unfortunate dismissals and team have two now! Must say it's a poor shot selection from batsman for there is no pace on offer from bowler. Garg shuffled across his off-stump and looked to scoop it past the keeper, lack of pace meant he failed to get any proper connection and ended up deflecting the ball onto stumps off his chest. batsman b bowler 12(13) [4s-1]"
10419,"FOUR, easy pickings for batsman! Gets plenty of width outside off and batsman throws the kitchen sink to smash the boundary ropes wide of the fielder at square third man"
10420,"out batsman Run Out!! 1 run completed. It's getting chaotic out in the middle and Rashid Khan was ball-watching as he tried to complete the second, didn't realize he was running in the same line as batsman and both batsmen collided mid-pitch which led to an easy run-out. In fairness, there was never a second there and it's pressure that's consuming team at the moment. batsman worked it to deep square and by the looks of it, he wanted second right from the onset. batsman run out (U Yadav/Philippe) 7(4) [4s-1]"
10421,out Bowled!! PACE.FULL.STRAIGHT. Always a deadly combination against the lower order batters. A 143ks thunderbolt from bowler and the middle pole is absolutely hammered. Bhuvi plays a nothing shot as he tries to slog across the line and only swishes thin air. batsman b bowler 0(2)
10422,"out Bowled!! Off pole this time. bowler likes hitting the stumps and we have seen a lot of that in the domestic cricket. A delivery that was too good for batsman. 144ks coming in from slightly wide of the crease and batsman is opened up by the angle, plays outside the line of the delivery and loses his off pole. Surely he's not 100 percent. A normal Rashid would have smashed that full ball over the rope! batsman b bowler 6(5) [4s-1]"
10423,"out Caught by Kohli!! Told ya, it's boom-or-bust and in all fairness, Marsh didn't have too many options there. Went for a mighty slog against a slower full ball and the moment it left the bat, he almost fell backwards before limping awkwardly behind the stumps. The slog came off the toe-end and Kohli accepts the dolly at long-on. Marsh is being helped off the field by the physio.batsman c Kohli b bowler 0(1)"
10424,"1 run, pushes the full ball to Padikkal at cover and sets off for a quick single. Dev attempts a direct hit at the bowling end and misses, had that hit Natarajan was gone"
10425,"FOUR, 141ks short and wide of off, batsman exposes his stumps and throws everything at it, gets a massive outside edge and it races down to the third man boundary in a jiffy"
10426,"out Caught by Kohli!! It's all over. team start their campaign with a victory and it's their second successive win over team. batsman gets pace but this time there isn't enough width and all he could do with the incoming angle was miscue the pull into safe hands of Kohli at long-on, who took a splendid catch sprinting across the boundary rope to his right. batsman c Kohli b bowler 9(6) [4s-1]"
10427,"FOUR, just a little full from bowler, and Pandey has sussed out that there's little swing here. So he's not afraid to hit through the line as he lofts it over mid-on"
10428,"FOUR, Umesh's struggles continue. Strays onto the pads and Pandey flicks it for four through midwicket. Timing is delightful with the ball racing away"
10429,"FOUR, oh dear! The confidence is just not there. And with each delivery it gets worse. Low full toss on leg, Pandey helps himself to another boundary as he flicks past short fine"
10430,"FOUR, that's a batsman special. The short-arm pull.. the way he just picks length quickly and whips it so effortlessly with superb timing. Flies away over square leg. Don't think Saini did too much wrong here. Just slightly short maybe, but we're talking inches here"
10431,"SIX, so tempting. So, so tempting and whacked! 85kph, looped up by Sundar. It's brave, but it's also too full so it eliminates the risk for Pandey who wallops it over midwicket. Smashes the roof over the first tier"
10432,"SIX, the scoop for six! Incredible shot. Good length delivery outside off, he sits on the back knee while leaning into the off-side and helps it on its way"
10433,"FOUR, when it's not going your way, these things also tend to happen. Full ball just outside off, batsman aims for the covers as he drives but it comes off a thick inside edge and runs past leg stump. Kohli applauds his bowler with a wry smile"
10434,"FOUR, flat one on the stumps, whip-driven straight down the ground for four. Finally, some runs in boundaries..."
10435,"FOUR, the shackles are showing signs of coming lose - reaches out and slices this marginally wide one square of the wicket for four..."
10436,"FOUR, a hat-trick of boundaries! Backs away into the on-side, and flays this inside out over the in-field to the deep extra cover boundary for four! team needed this - the activation energy for something exothermic to begin"
10437,"1 run, flatter one topspinning into Faf's gut, as he crouches and pulls it away to backward square leg for one"
10438,"out Caught by Samson! Charges, and tries to swing this over the on-side, but gets it close to the shoulder of the outside edge and almost over the 'keeper, but Samson can do no wrong today! Leaps to take that one, and it sticks! Maginificent catch to get rid of Jadhav! batsman c Samson b bowler 22(16) [4s-3]"
10439,"SIX, SMACK! Parag at the boundary has woefully misjudged it, and not for the first time, the outfielder is pointing at the floodlights! Charges down and carts it, with a bit of a hind-limb pirouette, over long-on for six!"
10440,"SIX, backs away into the on-side, Tewatia serves one up in the slot, and clobbers this over long-on for a gigantic six! More of these needed. Many more."
10441,"FOUR, another slower one, leg-cutter, like Tendulkar predicted in his tweet, and Faf backs away to slap it away through the gap at to extra cover for four"
10442,"SIX, charges this slower one and lifts this over long-on for six! Absolutely smoked that over one of the longer boundaries here at Sharjah!"
10443,"SIX, far too slow for even two bat-swings - 105.2km/h - and this ridiculously slow short ball has been clubbed over deep mid-wicket with a late pull for six!"
10444,"SIX, 14th fifty in IPL for Faf, and it's been brought up by one of the cleanest, straightest swings of the blade down the ground. Another six that seems to have cleared that diminutive Sharjah roof!"
10445,"SIX, half-volley outside off, clears his frontfoot, and makes it 4 out of 5 balls dispatched for six! Clobbers this over long-off! That's the fifty-stand - only 7 of which have been scored by Dhoni. Faf is in rhythm..."
10446,"no run, that's an inch-perfect yorker, dug-out from between his legs away to short fine leg - Faf is down, gets up and tries to run across, but there's a shy at the striker's end. Would've been out if it had hit..."
10447,"SIX, drops it short and into the body, but Faf picks the slower one - waits for it to arrive and clubs the pull over deep midwicket for six!"
10448,"out Caught by Samson! Short at the body, batsman loses his shape, instinctively worried about his fingers - he has history - and goes for a half-hearted hook. Gets a top-edge, as it lobs up towards the leg-gully area where Samson comes across to collect the catch. batsman c Samson b bowler 72(37) [4s-1 6s-7]"
10449,"SIX, MS batsman, far too late in the final over, dispatches this over deep midwicket for six! A batsman six, and the world goes crazy! My neighbours have gone crazy! Right in the slot and that's carted into the Sharjah streets..."
10450,"SIX, what's in that cricket bat? A slower one on a length, and that's a no-no to the world's best finisher - on his knee and he's mowed that over wide long-on for six! 92 meters!"
10451,"SIX, THWACK! MS batsman in the final over is a sight to behold! Slams this short ball, pulling it over deep square leg for third successive six. That's a joint IPL record - 33 sixes in a game..."
10452,"FOUR, there's the first boundary of the innings. Length ball on leg, batsman whips it away fine enough to beat fine leg"
10453,"FOUR, bowler shifts his line over to off stump where batsman is waiting after clearing his front leg. Just sets up brilliantly to smoke this flat-batted over mid-off"
10454,"1 run, a direct hit and batsman was gone. The idea of a quick single, after tapping this slower ball in front of cover, is well and good. But batsman is no spring chicken. Would've been a few inches short as the fielder swooped and spun around for the throw"
10455,"SIX, this is just a flick from batsman and it's gone all the way over square leg. Slower ball from Archer that drifted into the pads nicely to be put away"
10456,"FOUR, beats square leg this time. This was dragged down short on leg stump and batsman had ample time as he rocked back for the pull. Didn't time it all that well, but well enough"
10457,"SIX, there he goes, and clears the roof! Signature batsman this. So good with the pull shot against spin. Even deliveries that are slightly off in length, he pounces on them. This one, though, is a proper long hop and batsman just nails it over square leg"
10458,"SIX, short of length delivery around the hip, and if there's anyone you don't want to bowl this length at, it's batsman. Whips the pull away into the stands"
10459,"SIX, this is not good bowling. Dare I say bowler doesn't have the pace to trouble batsman with the short ball. It's playing into his strengths. And he's absolutely nailing these pull shots"
10460,"FOUR, there's four more. Back of a length outside off, batsman's aware that third man is in and he uses the pace to dab it past the fielder"
10461,"out Bowled!! The pull, the famed batsman pull, has brought about his downfall. Problem is the length isn't short at all. He's just trying to manufacture it out of nothing. Fails badly as this skids through onto his back pad and crashes into leg stump. May have been fooled by the trajectory actually. Tewatia kept it quite flat, pushing it through off the front of his hand. May have caused him to believe it was shorter than it was. batsman's furious with himself. batsman b bowler 33(21) [4s-1 6s-4]"
10462,"out Caught by Tom Curran!! Gopal's not only gotten away with a short ball, he's got a wicket for it. batsman toe-ends his pull straight to deep square leg. Took his time, made a run-a-ball 21 and now departs. This will hurt team. batsman c Tom Curran b bowler 21(21) [4s-3]"
10463,"FOUR, it's short once more from Gopal and Curran shows how it's done. Belts the pull away over midwicket"
10464,"SIX, Curran races down, ensures he gets right to the pitch of this googly and smokes it downtown. Already injecting life into the chase and he's only 3 balls in"
10465,"SIX, there's six more. Tewatia may not be feeding it into the slot for him, but Curran is creating his own length with excellent use of the feet. Gets close enough to this and hammers it back down the ground"
10466,"out Stumped!! Tewatia gets the better of him this time. He shortens the length far enough to give room for the googly to turn past the outside edge. Curran, who's running down the pitch again, doesn't back out despite not reaching to the pitch. He slogs in vain. And because he is so far down, there's no going back either despite a valiant effort to do so. Neat stumping from Samson. batsman st Samson b bowler 17(6) [4s-1 6s-2]"
10467,"out Stumped!! Charges down first ball and is nowhere near it. batsman, finding a place in the team today, goes for a duck. Third wicket for Tewatia, who kept this wide outside off and once again ensured the length's short enough. Easy stumping. batsman st Samson b bowler 0(1)"
10468,"SIX, lovely tossed up on off, batsman gets a big stride forward and then lifts it nonchalantly over long-off, went a long way into the stands"
10469,"out Caught by Chahar!! That is the end of the batsman show - he's furious with himself as he walks back. Would have been a wide had he let it go - but the adrenaline was pumping and he couldn't hold back - went chasing after that and lifted it towards deep cover - Chahar ran in, took it awkwardly around his chest, reverse cupped - it threatened to pop out, but he manages to clutch it safely. Was the slower short ball and batsman didn't have the pace on the shot. Some relief for the teamians, they clearly looked rattled. batsman c Chahar b bowler 74(32) [4s-1 6s-9]"
10470,"out Miller Run Out!! 1 run completed. Appeal for a run-out at the bowler's end, Miller dived, has it saved him? A flat throw and a good pick-up. No, the dive's not good enough and Miller falls for a diamond duck on his Royals debut. Unfortunate way to get dismissed - it didn't help that Miller lost his bat as well, could have saved him else. On a length and at the stumps, worked in front of square on the on-side and it was batsman's call for the second. Miller responded well, but lost his bat as he dived - good throw from Gaikwad and Kedar was at hand to break the stumps. Miller run out (Ruturaj Gaikwad/Kedar Jadhav) 0(0)"
10471,"SIX, chance, dropped and six - it's not happening in the field for team - Sam Curran, the culprit, this was tossed up slower and wider of off, batsman had to reach out and didn't get enough on the lofted drive - went flat and and wide of long-off. Curran stretched out with both hands, got to the ball and then let it burst through - was right in front of the ropes and that perhaps put him off"
10472,"out Caught by du Plessis!! A chance and Faf has grabbed it cleanly. Redemption for Piyush, he struggled in the first two overs, but is pulling things back a touch. A poor start for batsman in Royals colours - came down the track, got close to the ball and drilled the drive - went flat, hard and straight to long-off. Was perhaps looking to go over cover, but ended hitting it a lot straighter - was dying onto Faf, who slid forward and held on. batsman c du Plessis b bowler 5(9)"
10473,"1 run, slower and wider of off, eased square on the off-side for a single"
10474,"FOUR, cheeky and four, batsman at his best, moved all around the crease - bowler saw it coming and went wide of off, but batsman still reaches out and then paddles it over short fine - think, only AB could have rivalled him for that shot"
10475,"FOUR, cracking shot, the shots are coming off today for the Royals, friendly length ball wide of off, Tewatia drives it on the up and over cover - no need to run for those"
10476,"out Lbw!! That looked plumb and batsman has been given OUT LBW. He has a chat with his captain and decides to review. It's a fair delivery, looks like no bat and UltraEdge confirms it, directly onto his toes, bang in front of middle and it's crashing low into the middle. Three REDS and batsman is OUT. A poor review from Tewatia, think he thought he got an inside edge. Almost the perfect yorker from Curran, turned out to be a low full-toss, Tewatia swung all around it and missed. batsman lbw b bowler 10(8) [4s-1]"
10477,"FOUR, streaky and four, wide full-toss from Curran, Parag was shaping for the drive, opened the face of the bat and the edge flies behind square on the off-side for a boundary"
10478,"out Caught by Dhoni!! Edged and caught - A straightforward dismissal and the Super Kings are pulling things back nicely. Two wickets in the over for Curran - shortened his length and angled one across the right-hander, Parag was looking to run it past the keeper, got it too fine though and MS did the rest - dived across to his right and the ball got stuck in his fingertips, he clasped it cleanly on the second attempt. batsman c Dhoni b bowler 6(4) [4s-1]"
10479,"out Caught by Kedar Jadhav!! team are pulling things back very nicely, this was a length ball at the pads, batsman shuffled across and whipped it firmly, hit it in the air and straight down the throat of Kedar at deep mid-wicket. batsman is annoyed with himself as he walks back - suddenly, 200 looks very distant now. batsman c Kedar Jadhav b bowler 69(47) [4s-4 6s-4]"
10480,"FOUR, streaky and four, Tom must have faced Sam many a times at home - almost the perfect yorker, right at the base of off, Curran somehow jams his bat down and squeezes it past the diving short third man fielder for a boundary"
10481,"SIX, lovely, that's a clean hit from Archer, picked the slower ball early, extended his arms and lifted it high and over long-off for a maximum"
10482,"SIX, back-to-back sixes and the Royals are finishing on a high - Archer expects bowler to go short and he's quick to swivel across, gets a lovely connection on the pull and sends the ball soaring over square leg - went out of the ground as well"
10483,"no ball, SIX, four sixes on the trot - this is a stunning cameo from Archer - length ball at the stumps, Archer backs away and lifts it high and over long-off.. and the third umpire decides that the front-foot is just over, called as a no-ball"
10484,"no ball, SIX, a hat-trick of sixes, length ball at the stumps, Archer clears his front leg and thwacks it flat and hard, wide of long-on for a maximum - worse, bowler has overstepped by a massive margin and a free-hit is coming up"
10485,"FOUR, first boundary for batsman. Short of length delivery and he did not have much space to free his arms, but manages to pull it over mid-wicket and the fast outfield does the rest"
10486,"out Caught&Bowled!! Oh no! Good comeback by bowler. He persisted with the short ball and got it higher than the previous ball. batsman went for the pull and only managed a top-edge, goes straight up and both bowler and Dhoni converge, in the end it is the bowler who gets there first. batsman c and b bowler 6(6) [4s-1]"
10487,"FOUR, another short ball and this time batsman puts it away. No height or venom on this, batsman is quickly into position and nails the pull over mid-wicket, couple of bounces and it races away"
10488,"SIX, loosener from bowler and he has been dispatched into the empty stands. Back of length angling into leg, batsman loves it there, picks it up nonchalantly and sends it sailing over backward square leg"
10489,"FOUR, not sure he intended it to go that fine. Short of length with a bit of extra bounce, batsman steers it and the outside edge runs away fine - bisecting Dhoni and short third man"
10490,"SIX, cracking shot! That's more like it. Short of length around the hips, batsman gets into a good position this time and smashes the pull into the deep mid-wicket stands"
10491,"SIX, wow! That is some shot. He looks so elegant when on song. Picked the short of length delivery early, stayed on the front foot while transferring his weight back, pulls it handsomely over deep square leg and cleared the field comfortably"
10492,"FOUR, poor bowling from bowler. He has been all over the shop. Straying down leg and that is not where you bowl to batsman, easy pickings for the Royals skipper as he glances it fine past the fielder at 45"
10493,"SIX, he's dealing in sixes at the moment, third for him. Drifting in from the round the wicket angle, batsman swings through the line and smokes it all the way over wide long-on"
10494,"SIX, bowler put under pressure straightaway. batsman does not want him to settle. This is touch wide of off-stump and he goes with the spin, nice clean bat swing to take it over long-off. Might have gone out of the ground"
10495,"SIX, woah! batsman is on fire. First ball from bowler and he launches him straight down the ground. This was right in the slot though but still had to be put away, Dhoni has a word with bowler"
10496,"SIX, this is now officially a carnage. bowler goes wide of off-stump and batsman was happy with that line, good stride forward and lofts it with the spin over extra cover. Another one out in the car park"
10497,"1 run, fifty off 19 balls. batsman has turned it around for the Royals. Just a bat raise and is congratulated by his skipper. Quicker delivery outside off, batsman cracks it to sweeper cover"
10498,"SIX, ""looks like he is having a net,"" quips Gavaskar on air. He is treating them that away and has even impressed his skipper at the other end. Flighted and lands full, batsman clears his front leg and goes straight, that high backlift allows him to have a clean swing and it goes over the roof"
10499,"SIX, batsman has a piece of the leggie. 28 runs off the over. bowler went fast and short outside off, batsman does not commit to the shot, waits for it and then smacks it over extra cover."
10500,"1 run, flatter and around off, batsman moves back and across to work it towards mid-wicket"
10501,"SIX, bowler continues to travel.. Throws it up wider expecting to get away but batsman has other plans, he makes use of the width and smokes it straight back over, not the power of Samson but has enough to clear the rope"
10502,"SIX, this is bad bowling now. He is just feeding it in his slot. Flighted and lands it on a fullish length, right where batsman likes it, he lofts through the line and clearing the fence has not been difficult for him, well over long-off"
10503,"FOUR, good batting but poor bowling. batsman expected the fast short ball outside off, waited on it and carved it behind square on the off-side - right between backward point and short third man"
10504,"SIX, you just can't bowl full to batsman. Especially not at his pads, he will make you pay everytime. bowler went for the slower ball and batsman accepts the gift, picks it away off his pads effortlessly over deep square leg for the first six of this innings"
10505,"out Lbw!! DK and his slog, well, the love story isn't screening tonight. Chahar's kept it simple -- quick, straight, on off, no room, no spin. batsman goes one-kneed early, premeditatingly, and misses the sweep all ends up. Yep, plumb, not even worth reviewing a review. batsman lbw b bowler 30(23) [4s-5]"
10506,"FOUR, off-cutter, but short, wide (aka long hop). batsman throws his hands out and carves it behind point. The fielder in the deep tries a sliding tackle, but no, UAE is no football fan"
10507,"out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! bowler has his first IPL wicket since 2015. But no, forget that. That's not the best part. Hardik Pandya's a credit stealer .. with Rana slicing yet another off-paced delivery outside off. But that means he's got to manufacture all the pace on this himself, which he can't with these 70-meter-boundaries. Anyway, here's what Pandya does: he's at sweeper, and the ball's quickly flying wide of him to his left. So he runs, intercepts while running, side-on, and makes sure he doesn't overbalance. Sorry, words will never do justice. batsman c Hardik Pandya b bowler 24(18) [4s-2 6s-1]"
10508,"SIX, feeds the slot. And finally, FINALLY, batsman connects. He stands his ground, staying crouched, clearing his front leg and mowing this over cow corner"
10509,"FOUR, 131.5kph, wide high full toss, full paced. batsman flays, gets it past cover's dive. Well, it doesn't get easier"
10510,"FOUR, attempted: big smoke over extra cover. The result: a big fat outside edge over short third man. batsman and team couldn't care any less"
10511,"1 run, closer towards off, with batsman clearing out his front leg to and slogging away straight to long-on"
10512,"out Bowled!! That's it. Get on with the handshakes. Rohit's killed it by persisting with bowler. And bowler's killed it with simple sheer lack-of-pace. He's leg-cuttered it in full, angling in on leg-stump, and batsman's clearly beaten on his hoick of sorts with his bat going through with the swing only to hear the rattle of death behind. batsman b bowler 11(11) [4s-2]"
10513,"out Caught by de Kock!! Edges. And team are happy to get generous with their wickets. They aren't doing a team. So batsman backs away in trying to slap this over the covers, but bowler - with yet another cutter - gets it well across, taking the outside-edge and down the keeper's throat. batsman c de Kock b bowler 16(20) [4s-1 6s-1]"
10514,"out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! Sharp bouncer, a left-arm round angle that climbs up around the head, which Naik has no option but to try pulling off his front foot. Top-edged, tame, and deep mid-wicket. batsman c Hardik Pandya b bowler 1(3)"
10515,"FOUR, slaps over mid-off. Well, well. It might be a very miniscule drop in the ocean remaining for Kolkata, but a smoke nevertheless. Backs away, and absolutely thumps this shorter delivery over mid-off"
10516,"FOUR, keeps the pull down, staying up on the bounce that doesn't get big and nailing it through square leg. Again, just a drop, one tiny drop .."
10517,"SIX, 126.4kph, innocuous lazy delivery, off a back of a length sitting up on the pads. And batsman swipes across the line, getting it over short fine leg"
10518,"SIX, follows him in with the bouncer, but batsman' undoing some of his rubbish with the ball. And this one's with a super hook, comfortably over fine leg"
10519,"SIX, tonks off the front foot now. Gets under the good length and lofts it over long-on"
10520,"SIX .. make it 27, and remember it's off bowler -- 3-0-5-2 and then 1-0-27-0 to ruin. It's a low full toss, and is smoked straight over his head"
10521,"out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! The fun's over. A length delivery, in the slot you'd think at this stage of the game and with pace. But batsman goes a little too hard on his bat-swing, inside-halving the miscued balloon to deep mid-wicket. batsman c Hardik Pandya b bowler 33(12) [4s-1 6s-4]"
10522,"FOUR, that's a pie for Gill. Short, width and studded with pace on it outside off. Gill throws his bat and crunches it through the packed off-side field"
10523,"out Caught by Pollard!! Gill gets carried away and picks out Pollard at mid-wicket. He's aghast and well, Rohit, who's back on the field enjoyed that. Banged in short outside off, it was getting big and Gill wanted to pull. Was in no control and the timing also went for a toss. bowler draws first blood for Mumbai. batsman c Pollard b bowler 7(11) [4s-1]"
10524,"out Stumped!! Gives away his cards early with a charge down the pitch, which Chahar pulls his length back to and makes sure Mavi never gets there and finds himself stuck half way down. That sums up team tonight: Stuck cluelessly half way down with no chance of return. batsman st de Kock b bowler 9(10) [4s-1]"
10525,"FOUR, nice, confident beginning for DK. Of course, bowler was generous there; hurling it too full and thereby overpitching it just outside off, batsman didn't do anything fancy. Just leant forward, kept his head steady and drove it beautifully through extra cover"
10526,"1 run, rattles batsman with a short delivery and cramps him up for pace as he backs away to the leg-side. Pulls and it deflects onto his helmet before falling to the floor. His skipper calls him for a quick single and it would've been a disaster if bowler had hit the stumps there"
10527,"FOUR, glorious shot from batsman. He's come out with a positive intent. Sees the width, transfers his body weight across and slaps it wonderfully past cover. That just rocketed away to the fence in no time"
10528,"out Caught by de Kock!! That's how you pluck a fruit from a tree. Nonchalance from Qdk. batsman's feathered an edge and has to walk back. Never looked comfortable at the crease to be honest. bowler just kept it short and took it away from him. The Southpaw went for the cross-batted pull and it didn't really come off for him, de Kock timed his jump to perfection and snatched it with one glove. bowler roars and team have lost their second wicket. batsman c de Kock b bowler 9(10) [6s-1]"
10529,"SIX, Rana stamps his authority against spin. Read this tossed up delivery from Chahar that was planted outside off, made enough room and lifted it over mid-off. Has enough power to clear the ropes on the full"
10530,"FOUR, ""Catch"" was the cry from bowler but batsman has placed it just wide of Bumrah at short third man. Shorter outside off, batsman went for the cut and flashed hard at it. Outside edge flies quickly and rolls through to the boundary"
10531,"FOUR, batsman is playing with a lot of freedom today. Floater just outside off, batsman opens his stance and lofts it inside-out over extra cover. High percentage shot against spin.. brilliant!"
10532,"FOUR, second boundary of the over. Flatter from Chahar, Rana went low and executes the reverse sweep, hitting it over short third man's head"
10533,"FOUR, sliced over point! Rifles it full and wide of off, batsman reaches out and hits it uppishly in the gap"
10534,"FOUR, okay, team's engine has started to rev up. Both batsmen changing gears now. bowler keeps bowling it wider, Rana got into a good position and also anticipated it to be on the shorter side. Slapped it ferociously past extra cover and it trickles to the boundary"
10535,"SIX, as anticipated, the extra ball goes the distance. How often do we see this? Short and wide outside off, plenty of time for batsman to free his arms. Throws the kitchen sink and plays an upper cut as the ball sails over deep point for the first maximum of the evening. Frustrated is bowler as he spoils his over"
10536,"out Caught by Nikhil Naik!! Mavi strikes in his first over. That was in the air for an eternity, but the fielder there - Nikhil has managed to pouch it. Back of a length delivery by the young pacer and batsman plays an-across-the-line wild hoick, A thick top-edge is induced as the South African gets caught at mid-wicket. batsman c Nikhil Naik b bowler 1(3)"
10537,"out Suryakumar Yadav Run Out!! 1 run completed. Yadav knew too. He put in the desperate dive but stayed down as he knew he had not made it in. batsman steps out and is met by a back of a length delivery, he nudges it into the empty mid-wicket pocket and calls for the second, bowler chases after it and throws it to the bowler's end, Morgan gathers the ball and lights up the stumps. Even with a full length dive Yadav was six inches short. Suryakumar Yadav run out (bowler/Morgan) 47(28) [4s-6 6s-1]"
10538,"leg byes, 1 run, spinning in but down leg, batsman sweeps and misses, the ball deflects off his pad and nutmegs Karthik, the pair manage to cross over"
10539,"2 runs, fifty for batsman. He may not be in Eden or Wankhede but he still loves playing against team. Now needs to kick on and make it into a big innings. Slower and turning in, batsman commits to the sweep and gets a top-edge over the vacant short fine region, the duo are able to come back for the second"
10540,"FOUR, team have bowled a lot of short balls to batsman today and most of them have disappeared. This was outside off and batsman had the room to free his arms, slaps it over extra cover and the ball bounces just inside the rope"
10541,"SIX, ufff! When he plays the pull there is no ground big enough for him. Kuldeep errs in length, batsman had ample time to go back, get into position and nail the pull over deep mid-wicket"
10542,"SIX, this is batsman at his best. 200th IPL six. Dances down the wicket, gets to the pitch of the delivery and once he does that the rest is easy, lofts through the line and clears long-on comfortably"
10543,"FOUR, not a good start. Back of a length angled across the left hander, Tiwary flat-bats without any timing straight past bowler, with mid-on and mid-off inside the ring the ball races away to the fence"
10544,"SIX, 10 off the first two. This is a fabulous shot. Length ball around off-stump, Tiwary clears his front leg and then brings his bat down in a straight arc, sending the ball sailing over long-on"
10545,"out Caught by Cummins!! Much needed wicket for team? I ask that because it brings more dangerous batsmen out to the middle. This was sort of a knuckle ball from bowler, Tiwary made room to go over extra cover but was deceived for the lack of pace, hit it much straighter than he would have liked and Cummins settles under it near long-off. batsman c Cummins b bowler 21(13) [4s-1 6s-1]"
10546,"1 run, in the air and lands safely. Slower ball banged into the surface, batsman goes for his favorite pull but was a bit early into the shot, the ball hits him high on the bat and balloons towards square leg, no one there to take the catch"
10547,"1 run, tight single. Pandya moves across to flick it into the on-side, the leading edge flies towards backward point and Rohit calls for the quick single, he would have been short with a direct hit"
10548,"FOUR, lovely shot! Slower short of length delivery and Pandya pulls it in front of square, the best thing was he rolled his wrist to keep it in the gap and bisect the two fielders in the deep"
10549,"FOUR, and again.. bowler became predictable there. Pandya was waiting for the short of length stuff, he strikes this much better than the last one and it almost goes the distance"
10550,"SIX, ufff! Pandya was lining up for the back of a length/ short of length delivery, he moves across and nails the pull flat over deep mid-wicket, the ball goes on to strike one of the ad boardings in the stand. Another costly over from bowler, 19 runs off it and he still has an over"
10551,"FOUR, well team bowlers have to go back to the drawing boards after this game and come up with a different plan to batsman next time. Because the plan to bowl short hasn't worked today, this was off-pace but it didn't matter to batsman who smacks it to the right of deep mid-wicket, just short of the boundary rope"
10552,"out Caught by Cummins!! A fine knock comes to an end. Cummins might not be bowling well but he is catching everything that is coming his way. It was a juicy full toss but a tired batsman did not have enough in the tank to capitalize, he miscues the big heave and holes out to long-on. Mavi picks up his second and he has done a decent job this over. Can he finish it well? batsman c Cummins b bowler 80(54) [4s-3 6s-6]"
10553,"out Hit Wkt!! What happened there? Pandya starts walking. Karthik then sees the the stumps light up. Pandya has brought his bat down in such a way that it has clipped the off-bail. bowler went round the wicket and spears in the yorker outside off, Pandya goes deep in the crease to play that but as he is about to bring his bat down, he hits the stumps. Walks off with a smile on his face. bowler too had no idea as to what had happened. batsman hit wkt b bowler 18(13) [4s-2 6s-1]"
10554,"FOUR, misses the yorker and it is a juicy full toss just below waist, batsman picked his spot and it is deep mid-wicket. Not the best of connections and hence he picks up only a boundary"
10555,"wide, full delivery outside off, it was away from the tramline and batsman threw the kitchen sink at it, but still could not make any sort of connnection. Ravi signals a wide but Karthik challenged the decision. In the end, it stays with the onfield call"
10556,"FOUR, inside edged! Short of a length delivery outside off, seams into the batsman and batsman gets an inside edge as he flashes hard. Rockets past his stumps and races away to the fine leg fence in no time"
10557,"FOUR, not impressive lines by bowler. Straying on the pads and batsman clips it through square leg as the impeccable timing sends the ball to the deep square leg boundary"
10558,"FOUR, off the radar again. Width on offer as he bowls a length delivery. batsman goes back in his crease and caresses it through the gap at covers for the third boundary of this over. Dealing in boundaries is Surya at the moment"
10559,"FOUR, classic counterattack by Surya. This was a dropped catch at mid-wicket as Narine failed to reverse cup it, parrying it away to the fence. bowler bowled an overpitched delivery on leg and the right hander flicks it uppishly for the fourth boundary of the over"
10560,"SIX, the Hitman has arrived. Not for the first time has bowler been at the receiving end of such brilliance by batsman. Remember that six over extra cover Down Under? Hangs back in his crease, stands tall and thwacks the short ball over deep mid-wicket for half-a-dozen"
10561,"SIX, did someone say the boundaries are bigger? Not for this guy. bowler feeds him another back of a length delivery and the Mumbai skipper has smoked it over deep mid-wicket for six more"
10562,"FOUR, whipped away! Floated on middle and leg, batsman is on his front foot to heave this one towards the deep mid-wicket fence. Played that in the air, but more importantly in the gap"
10563,"FOUR, 50-run stand up for the second wicket. Short ball by bowler and batsman lines up for it. Treks back in the crease and pulls it over mid-wicket. Having conceded two boundaries in the over, bowler opts for a deep mid-wicket immediately"
10564,"FOUR, bowler ain't happy with the fielder at fine leg. Was a short ball and batsman it pulls it away as he beats the fielder in the deep"
10565,"SIX, into the stands! Clearly the biggest one of the evening. Typical batsman who nails his pull shot again. Back in his crease as he picks the length early and deposits it over deep square leg for many-a-mile"
10566,"SIX, what a shot! batsman puts on his dancing shoes, reads the googly, gets to the pitch of the delivery and lofts it over deep extra cover for a perfectly timed six. Run fest at the moment! And that has forced Karthik to have a word with his bowler"
10567,"FOUR, there's the loosener that spoils a good over - fuller length ball on the pads, clipped away to fine leg for four with just a tickle"
10568,"FOUR, back of a length, doesn't quite hurry on from the surface, and that's all class from batsman - opens the face and steers it away to the deep backward point fence for four"
10569,"FOUR, slightly short, doesn't exactly rise, but width on offer - chopped off the attempted cut, over backward point and away to the boundary where Umesh Yadav dives in vain"
10570,"1 run, fifty for batsman. Applause from his team mates in the dugout. It is his 17th IPL fifty and first as skipper. Pooran walks up to congratulate his skipper. Flatter delivery on the stumps, batsman works it to deep mid-wicket"
10571,"1 run, back of a length on off, batsman punches it to long-on"
10572,"leg byes, FOUR, poor delivery to start with. batsman might not have got any bat on this length delivery down leg, but there is a big deflection off the pad to beat a diving Philippe"
10573,"FOUR, top-edge and it runs away to the fence. batsman was in no control there. Sharp bouncer around the left shoulder, batsman was late on the hook and hence the edge, flies right over Philippe. He then practices playing the ramp instead of the hook"
10574,"FOUR, and Saini errs in length. He goes full and batsman is just too good there, extension of the arms and lofts it over extra cover, the ball has enough to trickle into the fence"
10575,"out Caught by de Villiers!! Oh no! batsman has nailed this but straight to the fielder. Dube's golden arm strikes again. Big call to trust him with this over after Saini had gone for a few, but batsman has just thrown it away. Charges down, converts it into an overpitched delivery and drills it straight to AB at mid-off. The idea was to place it wide of the fielder like he done to Umesh but batsman was not able to do that. batsman c de Villiers b bowler 17(18) [4s-1]"
10576,"1 run, now batsman almost chips one to mid-off. Ful delivery on off-stump, batsman is half hearted in his attempted loft, chips it towards mid-off, Negi is quick to race across the turf and dive to his right, just out of his reach"
10577,"FOUR, poor delivery and batsman does not miss out. Drifts this leggie too far down leg and it is easy pickings for batsman, he kneels down and sweeps it fine to the left of short fine leg"
10578,"out Caught by Finch!! There's something about Dube. Batsmen feel they can take him on but that has not been the case. First Pooran and now batsman. Those are two big wickets especially in such a situation where they have to license to go after the bowling. batsman backs away and takes a step down, Dube cleverly bangs the slower delivery into the surface, the flat-batted shot does not have the elevation to go over, Finch takes a good low catch at cover. batsman c Finch b bowler 5(6)"
10579,"SIX, woah! That's smashed. bowler became predictable there. Slower ball back of a length and batsman was waiting for this, gets into position quickly and nails the pull flat over deep mid-wicket"
10580,"1 run, dropped! Kohli has put one down in the deep. Low full toss and batsman crouches low to whip it over the rope, he doesn't get enough to clear the long boundary in Dubai, Kohli moves to his right and might have just overran a bit. He tries to adjust and take it over his head, but the ball just doesn't stick. How costly will it be?"
10581,"FOUR, neatly done. The dipping slower delivery, batsman moves around in the crease, gets inside the line and crouches a bit to scoop it over short fine leg"
10582,"FOUR, 116.8kph and batsman is waiting for it. Saini has to mix it up. This one had width as well, batsman throws his bat at the right time to bisect backward point and short third man"
10583,"1 run, oh no! Dropped again. Kohli again. Another slower ball on a fullish length, batsman tries his best to manufacture power, but doesn't manage to and skies it towards long-off, Kohli runs in and this was a much easier chance than the previous one. He wriggles his hand as to gesturing that the ball might have been wet due to dew"
10584,"SIX, AB tries his best to pull off another one of his Superman catches. But is not able to. Slower delivery on the stumps, batsman picks it away over backward square and he gets the elevation to beat a leaping AB. The South African tried to parry it in but he was not able to"
10585,"FOUR, hundred for batsman. Fine innings from the Kings XI skipper. He has led from the front and has put his team ahead in this tie. Takes off his helmet and soaks in the applause from his team mates and owners. And does the ""I don't hear anything"" celebration that he does. Full delivery outside off, batsman throws the kitchen sink and the outside edge flies over short third man"
10586,"SIX, oh my! That's disappeared into the top tier. bowler is just too predictable with his slower deliveries, it is all back of a length stuff, batsman waits and swings his bat at the right time, pumps it flat and all the way over deep mid-wicket"
10587,"SIX, he is putting on a show now. Not leaving any delivery that is in his arc. This was full and outside off, batsman stays leg-side to give the room to open his arms, opens the bat face and slices it over point. Another biggie.."
10588,"FOUR, he has had luck and this proves that today is his day. Good length ball around off, batsman clears his front leg to have a heave to the on-side, the thick inside edge races past the the stumps"
10589,"FOUR, batsman also gets into the act. Short and lacked venom, batsman gets inside the line and pulls it backward of square, he rolled his wrist to get the placement right and there was no stopping that"
10590,"FOUR, that's not a bad delivery but a fine shot. Dube spears in the wide yorker outside off, batsman makes room and opens the bat face to slice the drive behind square on the off-side, no chance for the sweeper to get across"
10591,"SIX, batsman brings up the 200 in style. Dube misses his yorker by a long distance, this was right in the swinging arc, batsman clears his front leg and pumps it into the first tier near long-on"
10592,"FOUR, this man in a different zone right now - charges down and flays this inside out over extra cover for four"
10593,"FOUR, into the pads, half-volley, and that's clipped away with ease through deep mid-wicket for four! Nope, ain't no white ball gonna swing in the third over - as KP points out..."
10594,"SIX, batsman finishes it in style. This is the highest ever score by a captain in IPL. He walks off to a standing ovation. We have been witness to a great innings from the Kings XI skipper. Slower delivery that is back of a length, batsman waits for it and flat-bats it straight down the ground. When he's striking them so well there are no grounds big enough"
10595,"FOUR, half-volley, a rare one from Saini, and batsman just has to step out as he crunches it through deep extra cover for four! Stunning shot!"
10596,"FOUR, a 135km/h bouncer from bowler, but batsman has picked it up, rocks back and nails the pull to the deep mid-wicket boundary for four. Not the best timing on that, but he's got it away..."
10597,"FOUR, that's a terrible full-toss at a gentle 133.1km/h, and batsman lays into it, caressing it through the covers for four. Nobody moved..."
10598,"1 run, another slower one on a length, worked away for a single (well, inside edge to be honest) to bring up the fifty-run stand in the powerplay. That's one box check. Platform laid for a good score."
10599,"FOUR, tossed up but drifting into the dangerous pad-line, and he's thrashed the sweep away to the backward square leg boundary for four"
10600,"out Bowled! Knocked him over! batsman has no clue about that googly, hasn't read it out of the hand, leaves a gaping hole between the bat and pad trying to play the expansive inside out drive, as if to a leg-break, but that one turns in and crashes into the stumps of batsman. It's Yuzi again, who's picked up the King-pin (from the last game at least). batsman b bowler 26(20) [4s-4]"
10601,"FOUR, not too short, skidding through very close to the stumps, and that's chopped away off a crouch to the third man fence for four! That's through Dale Steyn at short third man, who's absolutely made a mess of this!"
10602,"FOUR, right in the slot, wide half-volley, and batsman has just leant into a fabulous drive through the covers. Not even a dive in the infield can cut that off..."
10603,"SIX, free-hit, a half-volley, batsman gets under it, and slices this high and mighty over sweeper cover for six!"
10604,"FOUR, strays on the pads, and that's tickled away to the fine leg boundary for four! Yadav, Yadav, Yadav - you simply cannot do that..."
10605,"out Caught by Ravi Bishnoi!! The young man perishes. The run rate might have had a role to play. More than 10 per needed from ball one and batsman tried for an over enthusiastic pull. Backed away, top-edged it and the man at mid-on took it. The 'Salute Celebration' is back as well. batsman c Ravi Bishnoi b bowler 1(2)"
10606,"out Lbw!! That was plumb! The ball landed on a length, angled in and hit the batter dead in front of the sticks. batsman looked to play across the line and missed it to be in trouble. The umpire didn't take much time to make his decision. batsman lbw b bowler 0(3)"
10607,"FOUR, nice late guide to this short ball, third man dives to his right and palms it on the bounce as he can't get there. Oh is the right foot touching the rope as he recovered and try to flick it back? Yep, four!"
10608,"SIX, wow! What a shot! A great chance for Dube to knock a few in the middle and prepare for the remaining games. Short of a length delivery on the stumps, Dube pulls over mid-wicket and clears quite comfortably"
10609,"out Bowled!! That's the problem of being rooted to the crease. Never one to use his front foot well to the spinners, loves to play off the back foot. If bowler spotted that and deliberately fired this in on a good length, then full credit to him. Ill-advised flick off the back foot and that too off balance when he was trying shift back. Off the pad and into the sticks. batsman b bowler 12(12) [6s-1]"
10610,"out Bowled!! No, no! This is so poor from a senior pro who knows how exactly the IPL pans. Why not play out the overs! Yadav goes for an almighty hoick, he does muscle them long if he middles, but he misses and it crashes into middle and leg. Second wicket for the youngster. batsman b bowler 0(2)"
10611,"FOUR, batsman flicks through mid-wicket, oh big gap there and Pooran fumbles trying to slide and stop the ball. bowler looks away"
10612,"SIX, this bloke is a good batsman. Smoked quite a few in the TNPL. bowler floated the googly, but he's lunged forward to that and powered the ball over long-off"
10613,"out Caught by Agarwal!! bowler, in his debut IPL, bags the purple cap in the second game. Five wickets for the youngster, third of the game. Oh scratch that, actually got only one wicket in the first game. So doesn't have the cap yet. Needs one more. He nicely floats and invites the lofted hit, Sundar was tempted to back himself and go for the big hit, mistimed it to long-on. batsman c Agarwal b bowler 30(27) [4s-2 6s-1]"
10614,"FOUR, that's a nice hit over wide long-off, with the spin, off the front foot, decently timed. Oh the lofted inside-out drive is a great feeling!"
10615,"out Bowled!! Shake of the head from bowler. Why did he bowl the leggie to the tailender and not target the sticks with a googly like this one, says Ashwin to himself. Saini lofts over the top, or he wanted to, misses and sneaks through the gate. batsman b bowler 6(7) [4s-1]"
10616,out Lbw!! Misses the sweep and the finger goes up! 97-run win for team. Woah! Thats massive. batsman lbw b bowler 1(3)
10617,out Caught by Ravi Bishnoi!! Bangalore pressing the self destruct button now. This shot from batsman reminds me of his dismissal in the 2015 WC semis. A left-armer digging it short and getting the better of him thanks to an ungainly top-edge. This was caught easily at mid-on. That was short and angled across after a couple of fuller deliveries. Nicely set up by the bowler. He bent his back on this delivery and got his reward. batsman c Ravi Bishnoi b bowler 1(5)
10618,"FOUR, slow full toss and lofted over mid-on for the first four of the innings. That was a terrible delivery and batsman took advantage of it"
10619,"no run, Is batsman gone? The umpire has given him out caught behind. But batsman was quick to review it. That nipped in, batsman pushed at it and seems to have missed it. Mostly it went off the pads and into the keeper's gloves. Not out is the verdict and batsman is safe. Even he was safe on the LBW call as it was missing the wickets"
10620,"SIX, length delivery, off-pace as well, batsman has his weight on the back leg but still manages to slam it over long-off for a sixer. Was sweetly hit. batsman has to fire tonight for team"
10621,"FOUR, some room and batsman capitalises on it. Smashes it through the covers for a four. Got the room and pounced on it"
10622,"FOUR, too short, batsman pulls it down the ground over the mid-off fielder for a four. Shouts of catch were there but it was well away from the fielder. Even long-on tried to cut it off but couldn't"
10623,"FOUR, stays back, batsman pulls it behind square. That was once again short and punished by batsman"
10624,"FOUR, is it a four? Or has Cottrell managed to push it back into the playing area? Seems to be a four. Went really fine and the man at short fine leg gave it a good chase. ABD shows his deft side as well. He is off to a flier"
10625,"FOUR, sweeps it fine and sweeps it well to get it away for a four. That was well down leg and batsman helped himself to a boundary by placing it to the fine leg fence"
10626,"1 run, goes a little wide of the crease to deliver that googly. batsman nudged that out to deep mid-wicket for a single"
10627,out Bowled!! The quickish flattish leggie does it for bowler. That beat batsman on the outer edge as he looked to punch it and missed it for the off pole to be disturbed. The young man has a huge scalp. The partnership was building and has been broken now. Punjab get an important wicket to stop the momentum. batsman b bowler 20(21) [4s-3]
10628,"FOUR, floated up outside off and has been spanked past cover for a four. That was hit really hard and the man at deep cover despite trying his best just couldn't stop it"
10629,out Caught by Sarfaraz Khan!! The bat face turned on impact and has been taken at deep cover. The googly has done it for bowler. ABD has problems against leggies and has been exposed once more. The run rate also had a role to play in the dismissal. team have lost their top half and don't have much on the board. batsman c Sarfaraz Khan b bowler 28(18) [4s-4 6s-1]
10630,"1 run, use of the feet to drive this firmly down the ground to long-on"
10631,"FOUR, neat hit that to this short of length delivery. Wristed that behind square at the last minute to pick up the backward square leg gap. No chance for the man at fine leg"
10632,"1 run, he's not hit this well. He grunts ""Aaaargh"" as soon as he hit that in the air and Hetymer has put down a sitter. What has he done? This was the short delivery outside off stump, batsman just chipped it high over cover-point, Hetty ran in and probably overran, came around chest height and he couldn't control. This is a massive let off!"
10633,"FOUR, in the airrr, and in the gap! Is this Faf's day? He hasn't timed everything as well as Sharjah or Abu Dhabi! This time he ran down the pitch and had a wild swing at the lofted drive, good from Mishy to push it outside off stump and force Faf to fetch that, leading edge actually and it flew between cover and point. Dhawan didn't cut the angle and was slow to take off, he assmued the man at cover would grab that"
10634,"FOUR, oh that is quite a flick shot off the back foot. Wasn't all that short to be honest, he flicked that off the kneeroll! My word! Somehow generated enough power to beat the deep mid-wicket fielder"
10635,"FOUR, in the airrrr and just over the leaping Nortje at mid-off. Jadhav jumped down the pitch and flat-batted that short of length delivery, hit it flat, Nortje is tall, tried his best there but it escaped."
10636,"FOUR, that's an audacious pull shot from batsman to his countrymen. KG tried the slower delivery but dropped it short, Faf played the, aah let it come pull shot over the infield over mid-wicket"
10637,"FOUR, now deft touch from Kedar, oh that's beaten third man near the fence. Faf was shouting run, run, run.. to Kedar, who was so confident and just jogging. He was right. Third man was wide and he couldn't cut it off. That's one problem of having pace up your sleeve, batsman sometimes use it to their advantage"
10638,"1 run, tucks this short of length delivery to backward square leg. Fifty stand between these two"
10639,"out Lbw!! That is plumb in front! Impact right in front of off stump. You can't be slogging with a pull shot when it's not really short. Hit around the kneeroll. Jadhav seemed to be rushed by that length delivery and team have a breakthrough! Okay, was a slower delivery, so he was trying to adjust and that's why he missed. So far, a top over from bowler. batsman lbw b bowler 26(21) [4s-3]"
10640,"3 runs, uppish guide to this short delivery past backward point, they race back for three"
10641,"FOUR, low full toss and he's lofted that with such calmness. No real rush to power that ball, just placed it perfectly back over the ump's head and no chance for the men in the deep"
10642,"FOUR, oh no! Not there! bowler tried to nail the leg stump toe-crusher but bowled a low full toss down leg, batsman happily helps it away to fine leg for four"
10643,"2 runs, he hasn't timed it, it's highhhh and it's Hetmyer again who drops it. Full and on the stumps, batsman looks to loft over the infied, but he's skied this. Hetymer ran back from cover, a tough catch, but it looks like he never got a finger on it. No, on second viewing it is clear that he got both hands but it bursts through to fall on the ground"
10644,"out Caught by Pant!! Edged and into the hands of Pant. Is that the game for team? Death bowling is all about watching what the batsman does. Faf was backing away, so KG fired this short of length delivery wide of off and forced him to fetch, Faf tried to reach but only managed to kiss it to Pant as he overbalanced playing the shot. batsman c Pant b bowler 43(35) [4s-4]"
10645,"FOUR, guided, in the air but in the gap between short third man and backward point. batsman used pace on that short of length delivery really well"
10646,"out Caught by Pant!! batsman walks! Slower short delivery, batsman early into the pull shot, gets a thick edge that lobs in front of Pant who dives forward to complete the catch. This is so good from team. Oh a bit of glove love between KG and Jadeja too. Nice to see. batsman c Pant b bowler 15(12) [4s-2]"
10647,"FOUR, this by no means looked convincing. batsman backed away to open up the off-side field, Patel fired it within the stumps and batsman was committed to go for it. Dragged it off the cue-end and hits it uppishly, just manages to clear mid-on and earns a boundary"
10648,"no run, dropped. Pops out of Shaw's hands at square leg like a bar of soap. He got a lifeline when he was batting and now this. Karma eh? A strong wristy whip from batsman, hitting it on the up and straight to Shaw, who couldn't lock his hands in time and grasses it. batsman will breathe easy.. you can't drop these catches at this level"
10649,"out Caught by Mishra!! Cut straight to hand and bowler has three. Nice end to a comprehensive win from team. Short of a length, batsman guides and that's catching practice for Mishy. batsman c Mishra b bowler 12(9) [4s-1]"
10650,"FOUR, he's welcomed into the attack with a boundary. Went fuller just outside off, batsman goes hard and sort of squirted it off the inner half, miscued it airly and it flies past Rabada's dive at mid-on. No point chasing it as it scurries away to the fence"
10651,"SIX, Avesh is the weak link among DD's pacers and batsman knows it. A free-flowing swing of the bat, nailing it off the middle and launches it into the long-on stands. Can't bowl this length Avesh.."
10652,"out Caught by Hetmyer!! batsman walks straight into the trap set by Iyer and Co. For a second, I thought Hetmyer misjudged it by running in too far, but he keeps his calm and holds onto it. Another game, another instance of team losing an early wicket. batsman will be kicking himself there, couldn't have placed it any better. A short delivery begging to be hit, batsman jumped back and pulled it uppishly, didn't have the power to clear the fielder at deep mid-wicket. Very poor.. Patel is pumped. batsman c Hetmyer b bowler 14(16) [4s-1 6s-1]"
10653,"FOUR, not too smart bowling from bowler. Drifting onto batsman's pads, too easy for Faf as he just gets inside the line and tucks it past square leg. The timing is good enough to fetch him a four there"
10654,"out Caught by Rabada!! This was inevitable. With the way, he was timing it, you'd sensed it, a wicket was round the corner. batsman's painful stay at the crease comes to an end and has he played his last game for team? You never know. team are a happy bunch. A simple back of a length delivery just outside off, some extra zip and pace did the trick for bowler. batsman just swung his bat, got it high on the bat and spooned a dolly to Rabada at mid-on. team two down and in a spot of bother. batsman c Rabada b bowler 10(15) [4s-1]"
10655,"out Ruturaj Gaikwad Run Out!! This is the last thing team would've wanted at this stage. Needless. Patel lasers in the armer, batsman is cramped for room as he inside-edges it towards square leg. Ruturaj was keen to get to the other end as he races across the pitch only for Faf to send him back. Pant quickly sprints across and flings in a sharp throw to the bowler. He put in a full-length dive but wasn't enough. bowler cleanly breaks the stumps and he's a goner! Ruturaj Gaikwad run out (Pant/bowler) 5(10)"
10656,"FOUR, yup, cover, punch, high-elbows, covers. Typically Shaw. Spots the back of a length early and rocks behind in his crease to not over-hit this crunch, perfectly through the point and extra cover gap"
10657,"FOUR, pitched up this time with a bit of away swing. Shaw leans forward, and stays just as elegant -- drilling this cover drive with a louder crunch"
10658,"SIX, thumped over long-off. Not quite to the pitch of it, and he's against the spin, but there's enough in those arms to tonk over"
10659,"FOUR, pressure on the spinners as the openers are in complete control. Boundaries coming from both ends. batsman gets to the pitch of this delivery and whacks it over the bowler's head for four runs. bowler is running out of ideas"
10660,"out Lbw!! Gone! Just the wicket they were looking for. He was playing so well, there was no need to play the reverse sweep. Actually the reverse heave. bowler goes very full and the batsman gets beaten and rapped on the pads. The impact was around middle and this might have gone on to crash into the off-stump. Nevertheless, this was also the highest opening wicket stand for Delhi since 2016. batsman lbw b bowler 35(27) [4s-3 6s-1]"
10661,"FOUR, Delhi have just lost a wicket, but that's not going to affect Shaw. He'll keep playing his shots. This was short and wide outside off, Prithvi goes deep in his crease and cuts it past the man at short third man, four more.."
10662,"out Stumped!! bowler gets rid of both the openers in successive overs. batsman walks down the wicket to play the flatter delivery and gets outfoxed. Comes off an inside edge, rolls back off the pad towards Dhoni who had to lunge forward to get the ball and stretch to break the bails. No chance of getting back in and that's the end of an impressive innings by the Capitals' opener. Can team get a few more wickets and stem the flow of runs? batsman st Dhoni b bowler 64(43) [4s-9 6s-1]"
10663,"FOUR, typical batsman. Down on his knee in a flash as he picks the floated delivery to perfection. Enough elevation behind this scoop-like shot, with a lot more power behind. Almost went the distance at fine leg"
10664,"FOUR, impeccable timing behind this cover drive, and even Faf du Plessis can do nothing about it. Touch fuller outside off and it has been absolutely creamed through the huge gap on the off side"
10665,"FOUR, that was not needed. Dhoni wouldn't be happy with that. batsman had eased this one back to the bowler and Curran has a needless overthrow to give them four bonus runs. Would have been a dot ball, but he threw it down leg and Dhoni had no chance"
10666,"FOUR, not an impressive delivery by bowler. He has sprayed a full toss on the pads in his quest to attempt the yorker. Easy pickings for batsman was flicks it away to the deep square leg fence. That went flat and for a moment it seemed as if this will go the distance. Alas, it didn't"
10667,"FOUR, misfield by Kedar Jadhav at sweeper cover. This was absolutely smashed through the off side by batsman, but the fielder couldn't stop it in the deep. Dhoni applauds him for the effort though"
10668,"1 run, 50-run stand up between this pair as batsman squeezes the yorker to square third man. They need to hit a few big ones here.."
10669,"FOUR, and batsman is exactly doing that. On a length around off, batsman picks the length early and chips it over extra cover for a cracking four"
10670,"out Caught by Dhoni!! MS files to his right and takes a superb catch. What a spectacular over by Curran as he concedes only four runs. Slightly short ball outside off, batsman swings across the line and gets an outside edge which has been taken. A rather rusty knock comes to an end. batsman c Dhoni b bowler 26(22) [4s-1]"
10671,"FOUR, smashed! In the slot outside off and batsman has thumped it right over the bowler's head, can't keep a fielder there, can you?"
10672,"FOUR, first-ball four for batsman. Shuffles in the crease, moves miles across the crease and drags the short ball from outside off and manages to get it past the man at short fine leg"
10673,"leg byes, FOUR, runs for Delhi! Fired outside off on a yorker length and batsman once again attempts a similar shot. This one comes off his pads and beats Dhoni as it races away to the boundary. Doesn't matter how these runs come, as long as they do.."
10674,"FOUR, 130.1kph, ah, too easy. Leg-lined, leg-cutter and Shaw glances it into the totally empty backward square leg"
10675,"FOUR, 120.7kph, goes airy. Curran feeds length, and Shaw goes full-hearted, committing to slicing this easily over mid-off"
10676,"FOUR, slashed through the covers .. and Chahar, chasing it from sweeper just doesn't put in the dive, merely sticking his foot out. Oh dear .."
10677,"FOUR, picks the gap behind square, and nails. Opening his bat face and using the sheer pace that bowler's dishing out all over to get it perfectly out there"
10678,"SIX, here's the shackle-breaker. batsman finally middles, finally shows intent, sitting under this length and using the in-spin to slog it over deep square leg"
10679,"FOUR .. and again. bowler feeds it in the slog, and batsman slog-sweeps, more into cow corner though"
10680,"FOUR, top stuff. bowler gets just that little fuller-than-good, and Shaw goes inside-out, without a lot of feet movement either, lofting it wide of long-off comfortably"
10681,"FOUR, googly. But as if Shaw could care less, he's dancing down this time, making room for his arm and inside-outing it once again into that extra cover zone"
10682,"1 run, 96kph, straighter one on middle, with Shaw shuffling and tucking into mid-wicket. Also, a fifty"
10683,"FOUR, it's his turn to inside-out. Steps away, makes room and lofts one-bounced into extra cover's ropes"
10684,"FOUR, lovely, not a great ball from bowler, floaty half-volley on the pads, Gill gets inside the line and whips it over square leg, the man in the deep has no chance"
10685,"out Caught by Warner!! The start team would have wanted after being restricted to a modest score. Look at Warner go, he's pumped up, this could lift his team as well. Back of a length and at the stumps, batsman was slightly cramped up on the pull, gets a steepling top-edge towards mid-off and Warner made sure that everyone else stayed away. Watched it all along and held on, a fist pump from bowler as he exults. batsman c Warner b bowler 0(2)"
10686,"SIX, clubbed, Gill charges down the track to a good length delivery, didn't look like he got to the pitch of it, still went through with the bludgeon and gets enough to send it over the ropes at long-on"
10687,"FOUR, breaks the shackles in style! Swung across the line for a four. That was in the arc for batsman to thwack it through the square leg region"
10688,"FOUR, short delivery outside off and has been cut away past point for a four. That was delightfully done. Fifty for the young man. Has been an excellent knock! He has played shots all around the ground and more importantly very judiciously"
10689,"1 run, full toss and almost a return catch! That was played with a twisted face of the bat and just away from the clutches of the bowler, who made an attempt to grab it to his right"
10690,"wide, again down leg, batsman misses the tuck and this time it has been wided"
10691,"1 run, fifty of the partnership comes up! That angled in and has been pushed down to long-on for a single. team in control"
10692,"SIX, fuller delivery angled across, batsman lofts it huge over deep cover for a sixer! Lovely hit. The freedom was there for the southpaw and he just opened his arms"
10693,"FOUR, tossed up delivery and has been slog swept! That was floated up and batsman knelt down to thwack it hard"
10694,"SIX, chips down the track and lofts it huge down the ground! Superb hit from batsman as he wants to have an early finish"
10695,"SIX, short ball outside off and has been pulled away handsomely over deep mid for a sixer! Got under it and slammed it. Only 2 needed now. batsman unleashed that big shot as he saw it too short"
10696,"FOUR, redemption for team! And that too without much hullabaloo. That was a full toss and batsman powered it past the bowler for a four. Struck really hard by the southpaw to bring about their first win of the season!"
10697,"FOUR, cracking shot, hint of width and those fast hands of Rana does the rest - stands tall and punches it in front of square on the off-side, past the dive at backward point and runs away to the ropes"
10698,"FOUR, lovely, he's looking in excellent touch, Rana - back of a length and just outside off, not much width on offer, Rana still stands tall and punches it on the up, past the fielder at cover and runs away to the ropes"
10699,"FOUR, top-edge and four, no control over this pull from Rana, but he got enough bat to clear Saha and his gloves, banged in short and well wide of off, Rana was clearly late on the shot"
10700,"FOUR, sheer timing from Rana, back of a length and on the hips, he gets inside the line and clips it past square leg, the timing is sweet and the ball runs away to the boundary ropes"
10701,"FOUR, hat-trick of boundaries, short and wide of off, Rana gets on top of the bounce and cuts it up and over backward point - third man is fine and has no chance"
10702,"FOUR, Rana can't do much wrong today, friendly full-toss from Natarajan, he leans forward, presents the full face of the bat and drives it back past the umpire - two fielders gave chase, but the ball beats them to the ropes"
10703,"out Caught by W Saha!! A loose moment and Rana finds himself back on the way to the dressing room. He would be livid with himself, looked a million dollars, only to throw it all away. On a good length and a hint of shape away from the left-hander, Rana's feet went nowhere as he drove, gets a thick audible edge and Saha snaps it up. A wicket against the run of play, a wicket that would raise the hopes of team once again. batsman c W Saha b bowler 26(13) [4s-6]"
10704,"FOUR, short, wide and four, the attempted slower ball from Khaleel, but it all went wrong - sat up to be smacked, Gill backed away and then thrashed it over cover for a boundary"
10705,"FOUR, back-to-back boundaries - Gill is batting beautifully, men inside the ring in the off-side and he's opening up that gap with subtle feet movements - backs away to a length ball and then cuts it behind square on the off-side for a boundary"
10706,"out Lbw!! Celeb appeal and the umpire's finger goes up for LBW. Think DK was happy to go, but he then chatted with his partner and decided to review. Pretty sure the 15-second time gap had elapsed, but here we go. It's a fair delivery and there's no inside edge on that. Was the wrong 'un and DK didn't read it one bit. UltraEdge confirms that there's no bat on that, Hawk-Eye in and it's three REDS. batsman is OUT and team have wasted their review. Lovely delivery from Khan, slipped in the wrong 'un and batsman didn't spot it - ended up playing outside the line as he lunged forward. Past the inside edge and struck adjacent to middle, was going on and crashing into the middle-stump. team keep themselves in the hunt with timely wickets. batsman lbw b bowler 0(3)"
10707,"FOUR, nicely played, batsman brings out the reverse sweep - bends down low and gets enough bat to clear short third man - was the leg-break and he played with the turn"
10708,"FOUR, 101kph, bowler fires one in the blockhole outside off, Pandey reaches out to squeeze it away with a horizontal blade and gets a faint under edge. The ball goes through the legs of the keeper and runs away to the fence. bowler has his hands on his head"
10709,"FOUR, Nagarkoti slightly errs with his length and Pandey takes toll of it. Overpitched outside off at 139.5kph, the right-hander stays leg-side of the ball and batters it wide of mid-off. No need to run for those"
10710,"1 run, 92kph, very full and around off, Pandey clears his front leg for a hoick-across-the-line and inside-edges it to mid-wicket"
10711,"SIX, Saha had to up the ante! Shimmies down the track, crouches low and swings his bat hard to flog it over mid-wicket. There was a man in the deep, but the keeper-batsman got enough wood on it to clear the fielder. Nevertheless, an excellent spell from bowler comes to an end -- 4-0-25-1"
10712,"FOUR, just wide of mid-off! 135.4kph, shortish ball, Pandey wanted to flat bat it over mid-off. Got it off the top part of the bat and wasn't in control of his shot. Fortunately for him, it beat Narine to his right and the ball raced away to the long-off fence"
10713,"1 run, fifty for batsman! An off-pace ball, Pandey reaches the landmark with a cut to deep point. Just a raise of the bat from team's No. 3"
10714,"out Caught&Bowled!! A high full toss at 139.4kph, and is batsman is out caught-and-bowled? The umpires send it upstairs. It's below the waist and Pandey has to walk back. This is a big wicket. A full toss just below the waist from round the wicket, Pandey was initially looking to run it down to third man and later decided to work it into the on-side. In the end, the ball lobbed up off the splice of the bat. He was taken aback by the full toss. A simple return catch for Dre Russ. batsman c and b bowler 51(38) [4s-3 6s-2]"
10715,"FOUR, in the air and Nagarkoti has misjudged it! He charged in from third man and over-ran, put in a desperate leap in the end, but the ball was out of his reach. Goes to the fence on the bounce. A leg-stump full toss and Saha got a big leading edge trying to flick it away. Streaky, but team won't mind"
10716,"FOUR, slapped! A short of length delivery outside off at 138.1kph, batsman clears his front leg and muscles the cross-batted shot through the covers. Not a muscle moved. Stand and deliver"
10717,"FOUR, 134.9kph, full toss on leg from round the wicket, batsman flicks it away handsomely over square leg for a one-bounce four. Good start to the over for team"
10718,"out W Saha Run Out!! 1 run completed. Better length from bowler, full and outside off, batsman batters it to long-off. Saha decides to come back for the second, but batsman is unmoved. The former spots it only after coming halfway down the pitch. Cummins fires a good throw to the keeper's end and Karthik completes the proceedings. Easy call for the TV umpire. W Saha run out (Cummins/Karthik) 30(31) [4s-1 6s-1]"
10719,"byes, 1 run, 140.6kph, shortish ball outside off, Sharma wafts and is beaten by the pace and bounce. The batsmen decide to sneak a run via byes. Karthik lobs it to the bowler, but bowler misses the target at his end"
10720,"SIX, up, up and over long-on. batsman has seen enough and it's time to get into business. Slightly bends forward, reaches out with his long levers as he pummels it high and sends it over the ropes. There was a fielder waiting but it cleared him. First shot of real intent and it's a six"
10721,"FOUR, muscled past mid-on. bowler dropping it a tad shorter, batsman takes full toll of it. Sits deep, twirls his wrists and places it perfectly in the gap.."
10722,"no run, fullish just outside off, batsman sits low outside off looking to scoop it over short fine leg. Loses his balance and it flies off the pad to short third man. DK calls for it and grabs. Appeals and the finger went up. batsman knew he didn't hit it, so got it overturned"
10723,"out Bowled!! Knocked him over. So, he doesn't last long then. bowler cleans him up. He's been excellent today, rarely has bowled a bad ball. Just sticks to the traditional length and targets the stumps. batsman follows a similar approach of making room and exposes all the three stumps. Misses it altogether on this occasion and the off-pole takes a beating. team have struck early here. bowler is delighted with the breakthrough.. batsman b bowler 5(10)"
10724,"SIX, that's batsman for you. Banged in short and Pandey smokes it over cow corner. A 81-metre hit. The ideal length for him and he tees off. He's away with a maximum and Warner liked it too"
10725,"FOUR, there was a man at deep square leg but batsman still went for it and timed it properly. Got a hunch that a short ball was coming, quickly hung back and got on top of the bounce. Then employed some power and pulled it exactly where he wanted. To the right of deep square leg and it travels rapidly to the fence"
10726,"SIX, clean hitting from Pandey. Uses his feet, gets to the pitch and extends his bat swing in tonking it over long-on. Stunning timing on that"
10727,"out Caught&Bowled!! First IPL scalp for Varun bowler in this edition of IPL. And it's the big fish - batsman. A blip in concentration for team's captain after the break. A nothing shot really. This gave an impression of stopping upon reaching the batsman. Teased batsman into pushing at it, he went a bit too hard and chips it back to the bowler. bowler doesn't drop those. It was catching practice indeed. team camp are elated. batsman c and b bowler 36(30) [4s-2 6s-1]"
10728,"no run, it was the slider, Saha stayed back and didn't pick it. Played it outside the line, gets trapped on the back leg. Oh, it was the googly in fact.. close shave for Saha"
10729,"SIX, that's one length you don't bowl to batsman. He thrives with anything short, the round the wicket angle was also taking it down leg, batsman swivels and helps along the way over fine leg. With the fielder inside the ring it was more comfortable to put it away"
10730,"FOUR, in the air and just over. Expensive start for bowler, 14 off the first over. Full and curling away outside off, batsman is in no control of the drive as he hits it uppishly and manages to get it over the leaping cover-point fielder"
10731,"out Caught by (sub)Negi!! First time Sundar has opened the bowling this season and he has got the big wicket of batsman. Just the start team wanted especially after an expensive over from Udana. batsman had enough of defending and was looking to go for the biggie, the length was fraction short and he was quick to pounce, pulls it high and that would have gone the distance in any other ground but not in Dubai, Negi settles under it at deep mid-wicket and hangs on comfortably. batsman c (sub)Negi b bowler 8(8) [6s-1]"
10732,"SIX, welcome back to the attack, Saini. Kishan lays into him, showing no respect to this full ball. Right in his arc and that's been slammed straight down the ground for a maximum"
10733,"SIX, okay, Kishan has decided to change gears and he's targeting Saini. Again gets the length up, Kishan was waiting for this. Just gets under it and muscles it a mile over deep mid-wicket. Second six of the over, pressure on the bowler"
10734,"out Caught by (sub)Negi!! The celebration from Virat Kohli and Co. just tells you this wicket meant a lot to them. bowler strikes gold for his team as batsman departs. Got a lot of height on this mow, it's a big boundary at deep mid-wicket, it required more power to clear the fence, but sadly he couldn't generate it. Ubiquitous Negi circles around and pouches it safely. Massive blow to team. batsman c (sub)Negi b bowler 15(13) [6s-1]"
10735,"SIX, fifty for batsman. It's his comeback game, replaced Tiwary and he's making this opportunity count. bowler gets it too full, Kishan gets underneath it and smokes it a long way over cow corner. Brings up the milestone in some style"
10736,"2 runs, They are checking for a boundary. Udana seems to have done a good job in saving a couple for his team. A thick top edge on the sweep, the fielder at short fine leg thought he was in business but it soared over his head. Udana runs across from the deep and keeps the ball in play"
10737,"SIX, Mumbai need more of this. A dragged-down delivery from bowler, Kishan has all the time in the world to hang back and swipe it over deep backward square leg. Brute force from Kishan.."
10738,"FOUR, chance? Nope, seems to have dropped just in front of Devdutt at long-off. A toe-ended swat from batsman, dumps it to the left of Devdutt, who bolted to his left and went for the catch. But the ball dipped and unfortunately, he couldn't get his body behind the line as well. Four more to batsman"
10739,"FOUR, gotta feel for Saini. This was a yorker just outside off, Kishan waited and waited for it, opened his bat face and just guided it very fine at third man. Talk about placement and timing... wow"
10740,"FOUR, that's bullied down the ground at long-off. My god! What power from batsman. bowler errs and bowls it in the slot for him. No chance for the fielder there, it just rocketed away to the fence in a jiffy"
10741,"SIX, oh boyyyyy! Has Negi dropped the match here? What a big miss from him at deep extra cover. After taking so many catches, he lets one burst through his hands. Flighted just outside off, batsman mistimes it as it comes off the toe-end. Skies in the air near the fence, Negi was in good position but it slips through and sails over the rope. You can't give a lifeline to someone like batsman, he will make you pay.."
10742,"SIX, and he does. Rightaway! A rank long hop, batsman sits back and clobbers it a countrymile over cow corner"
10743,"SIX, told ya! batsman is making that drop count. Yet another maximum.. Tosses up by bowler, batsman didn't get it off the middle but still has imparts enough power on it to smash it over long-on"
10744,"3 runs, in the air.. another chance and Chahal this time makes a meal of it. What are team doing? Very poor.. batsman looks to go for another biggie, gets a thick edge which goes up towards backward point. Chahal circles around, never looked comfortable and worse is.. doesn't even get a hand on it. Phew!"
10745,"SIX, naahhh! batsman ain't showing any mercy. Tonks it over long-off. Served it up slower and wider of off, batsman's long levers coming to the fore.. sends it into the empty stands"
10746,"SIX, Kishan gets into the act now. Not so great bowling from bowler. Where's the googly mate? Just tosses another leg-break, Kishan pivots back, reads it and slogs it over deep mid-wicket"
10747,"SIX, 20-ball fifty for batsman. What a player. What a knock this has been. team back in the game. Another big over. Flatter leg-break from bowler, batsman skips back, makes room and murders it over long-off"
10748,"SIX, my word! How did this fly over the ropes? A proper mis-hit from Kishan, directs it into the night sky and Virat at long-off was setting himself near the boundary, but it gains some distance and loops over his head. Crazy"
10749,"SIX, butter fingers everywhere for team. Gurkeerat at long-on messes it up. Kishan muscled it flat and straight to him, he got both hands but couldn't lock it in time. Terrible.. and morever, he tips it over the bar for SIX"
10750,"SIX, batsman, you beauty.. connects and connects this one properly. Moves across his stumps and pummels it over long-on. Too predictable from bowler and Virat throws his head in anger. Rohit jumps from his chair. Oh! What's happening!"
10751,"out Caught by Devdutt Padikkal!! More twist. More drama. Kishan's fallen a solitary run short of his century. Uff! A slower ball from bowler, trimmed his length a bit and Kishan slogged it hard, doesn't have power to clear deep mid-wicket and Devdutt clasps onto it. Take a bow, Kishan though. He's played a gem and has taken team closer.. batsman c Devdutt Padikkal b bowler 99(58) [4s-2 6s-9]"
10752,"out Caught by de Villiers!! team have two now. They had a solitary wicket in the powerplay before today and that too a lucky dismissal of Warner and now they have two in the space of four balls. Short of length delivery angled across the right hander, the ball bounces more than Suryakumar anticipated, he goes for the steer and edges it behind to the keeper. AB has a juggle before completing the catch. batsman c de Villiers b bowler 0(2)"
10753,"FOUR, that's a freebie first up. Short and plenty of width on offer, Kishan tries his best to get on top of the bounce to play the cut, but flays it uppishly past the diving backward point fielder"
10754,"FOUR, IT's a TIE. The scores are level as batsman pulls this to the fence at deep mid-wicket. Dug in short, batsman stayed back and placed it perfectly. SUPER OVER to decide the winner. Elation in both camps. Kohli is relieved for the moment and smiles that they haven't come second. He walks off briskly to push for a Super Over win"
10755,"SIX, shot! That's a fine hit from Kishan. Short and at the body, Kishan swivels and pulls, he got it right off the meat as the ball sailed over the long leg fence. The ball is lost in the stands and the fourth umpire brings out a box of replacement balls.."
10756,"out Caught by (sub)Negi!! This was on the cards. batsman never looked comfortable at the crease and with the required rate shooting up he had no other choice but to go after the spinner. bowler is not afraid of getting hit, he tosses it up generously but gets it to dip on the southpaw, batsman goes for the slog sweep and miscues it horribly, a much simpler catch for Negi at deep mid-wicket this time. batsman c (sub)Negi b bowler 14(15) [4s-1]"
10757,"SIX, that's a horrible delivery. bowler overcooks the delivery and it ends up as a full toss, Pandya does not need a second invitation, deposits it to the biggest part of the ground - to deep mid-wicket. Even some of his team mates were impressed on the distance he got"
10758,"FOUR, that's a freebie for any batsman. bowler gets a bit greedy tries to swing it away from middle and leg, but the ball keeps going with the angle, Padikkal flicks it stylishly backward of square and the new cherry races away to the fence"
10759,"FOUR, edged and four, clear intention from batsman, runs down the track, was done in the by slower ball, but he had a free swing at that, gets a fat edge that flies over the lone slip"
10760,"out Caught by Rohit!! No. no. no! You don't want to see that if you are a batsman fan! That was a painful stay, but credit to bowler. He troubled batsman and deserved this wicket. Was the leggie, probably that diagonal over the wicket angle is troubling him - he was bowling most deliveries to batsman from that angle. However, this was bowled with a conventional run-up, pitching on a length and turning away, batsman loses one hand on the handle and chips it to cover. batsman c Rohit b bowler 3(11)"
10761,"SIX, now that is some shot! Kohli hit a six over long-off in an international game and this is a little similar to that. Not easy to loft handsomely off the back foot and he did so without balance too. Great shot!"
10762,"SIX, now the full flowing bat down the ground to loft bowler into the sightscreen. batsman, what a talent. Length delivery, in the slot, but Padikkal made it look so easy. Rohit not happy with the length or the idea from the bowler"
10763,"FOUR, oh that seemed effortless. Short and angling in, batsman was cramped on the pull, but lofted that over infield, the timing was good enough to clear long-on"
10764,"FOUR, they have been trying to bowl wide of off to Padikkal and he smartly targets the cover region with a nice lofted hit, just bounced inside the line"
10765,"FOUR, no pace on this length delivery, but enough width to free the arms. Past backward point and the cut shot heads to the boundary. Second fifty in three games for young Padikkal. The team dugout is so happy for him. AB pats him on the helmet"
10766,"FOUR, taking pace off is fine, but you can't bowl down leg with no fine leg. Easily helped away behind square for a boundary"
10767,"FOUR, if you are bowling full and outside off stump it's got to be really wide. This is right in the slot as bowler misses the yorker, batsman gets into a great position to loft over cover"
10768,"SIX, okay! Never bowl within the bodyline to AB when he's looking for quick runs. The slower ball sat into the surfaces, batsman hangs back and pulls over mid-wicket. Didn't bother running"
10769,"SIX, no Jas B! Unless you get that yorker right, it's difficult to control AB when you bowl into his body! This is another yorker missed, right in the slot and batsman, clearing the front leg out of the way, powers it handsomely over the bowler's head for a maximum"
10770,"out Caught by Pollard!! Pollard takes a really good catch. bowler dropping the slower ball short and wide of off, forcing Padikkal to fetch, Padikkal went for the pull, hit it decently, but big Pollard ran to his left, used all his height to great effect to take a gentle leaping catch. Well played young Dev! bowler's actually on a hat-trick, got Finch off the last ball of his previous over. batsman c Pollard b bowler 54(40) [4s-5 6s-2]"
10771,"SIX, just 4 runs off the over till this ball, so it should have been a smart delivery, but bowler, having got away with a short slower ball first delivery, tries again, but AB will feed on those anything within his bodyline at the end overs. Pulls, really high and into the stands over long leg"
10772,"FOUR, Jas B isn't nailing those yorkers. Low full toss outside off stump, batsman lofts straight down the ground and any batsman need not hit such deliveries hard, just placed over the bowler"
10773,"FOUR, smart, really smart from Dube. Seriously can't understand bowler bowling short and angling outside off stump with third man in, Dube just uses the pace offered and guides past the fielder inside"
10774,"SIX, how high was that hit? What a way to raise a fifty. Such a lovely player to watch at the death. Really interesting ploy from bowler to continue to bowl into AB's body than bowl outside off stump and make him to force pace. This is just a length delivery that's been absolutely muscled over deep square leg"
10775,"SIX, wow! Really nice cameo this from Dube. Knew bowler is going to bowl full and wide of off stump, read the slower delivery, got down on one knee and powered this over cover"
10776,"SIX, this is so stylish flicked! Stunning hit! Rohit folds hands and looks. Fullish and angled in, Dube just uses his hands on that to wrist it with a strong bottom hand grip, so easily clearing mid-wicket"
10777,"no run, chance and Rohit has dropped it - fair to say, he has saved four runs - short and just outside off, batsman rocked back and drilled the pull, to the left of mid-wicket. Rohit moved across quickly, got both hands on the ball, but can't hold on"
10778,"SIX, lovely, superbly played by batsman, length delivery outside off, he reached forward, got close to the ball, a clean extension of his arms and he drop kicks it over the long-off fence"
10779,"SIX, why? Just why? Coaches, experts plead not to bowl length at the death but bowler has bowled a slower ball halfway down the pitch. Dube stands tall and flat-bats it really straight. What a finish for team - 201"
10780,"FOUR, cracking shot, batsman is on a mission - back of a length and well wide of off, he swivels across and pulls it in front of square on the on-side - one bounce and over the ropes"
10781,"FOUR, lovely, Chahar was trying to follow batsman as he backed away, but the length is far too short, pulled away with immense power over square leg for a boundary"
10782,"FOUR, back-to-back boundaries for batsman, this is excellent batting, fired short and down leg, he bends down low, uses the pace on the ball and laps it over short fine for a boundary"
10783,"FOUR, make it a hat-trick of boundaries - this is poor bowling from Chahar - dropped short and on off-stump, batsman made room and cracked it square on the off-side for yet another boundary"
10784,"leg byes, FOUR, poor line from bowler, short and on Padikkal's hips, he was looking to flick and missed, clipped the thigh-pad and beat the diving keeper - brings up the 50 for team"
10785,"FOUR, cracking shot, he isn't afraid of playing his shots - banged in short and at the stumps, Padikkal swivels across and pulls it over square leg, no one in the deep and it's another boundary"
10786,"FOUR, nicely played, loopy delivery wide of off, batsman gets a good stride forward and goes inside out over cover, almost went all the way, bounced just in front of the ropes"
10787,"FOUR, nicely played, fifty for batsman, his first for team - tossed up quicker and sliding down leg, he bends half-way down and sweeps it behind square on the on-side for a boundary"
10788,"FOUR, this is smart batting. Looked like the short slower delivery on the leg stump, Padikkal gets inside the line, swivels and helps it away fine knowing fine leg is very square"
10789,"out Caught by Pollard!! Catching practice for Pollard at long-off - the threatening partnership has been broken. Change of pace and batsman was done in completely - the slower ball and batsman had to manufacture all the pace on this attempted lofted drive - was looking to go over cover, but it skewed off the inner half and lobbed down towards Pollard at long-off. He didn't have to move, a fine knock from batsman comes to an end. batsman c Pollard b bowler 52(35) [4s-7 6s-1]"
10790,"out Caught by Bairstow!! There is the edge.. Bairstow takes it neatly in front of his face and Bhuvi strikes in his first over. Got extra lift on this outswinger, beautiful seam presentation as it nibbles away outside off. Shaw with zero feet movement chases and nicks it behind. Early jitters in the team camp. batsman c Bairstow b bowler 2(5)"
10791,"out Caught by Bairstow!! SHR review an edge: A googly, spinning sharply across batsman's heave. And there's a little tickle off the toe-end. Bairstow's heard it, but he whips the bails off before appealing, confusing the umpire. So again, the excuse of blaming it on the loud noisy crowds for umpires missing nicks stands exposed. batsman c Bairstow b bowler 34(31) [4s-4]"
10792,"SIX, and there's the insult rubbed in .. batsman's not messing around, staying his ground and for a change not over-hitting as he manages a lovely bat flow in slogging it over cow corner"
10793,"SIX, more insult -- off a slice this time, over long-off. Neat bat swing, and a flat tonk"
10794,"leg byes, FOUR, 135kph, high full toss, and as if that weren't enough, he's dished out a filthy line heading down leg as well. batsman whips, or rather gets a thick chunk of his thigh pad, and it comfortably goes past the keeper"
10795,"SIX, 137kph, feeds a full toss in the arc at full pace. Well, well, it can't get easier. batsman finds his arc, swinging and heaving over cow corner. This should break shackles"
10796,"SIX, picks the off-cutter for treatment here -- with Ahmed insisting on feeding it short, wide, and getting sliced uppishly over backward point"
10797,"out Caught by Manish Pandey!! One bobble, second pouch. Kumar - bringing all his experience into this - keeps it slow, outside off and forces batsman to reach out and slice it to the longest part of the boundary at long-off. Doesn't matter, he'd miscued it alright as Pandey runs in from the boundary, and holds on with some help from his chest. So team finally are into their home territory of small defences, choking out teams at the death. batsman c Manish Pandey b bowler 21(12) [6s-2]"
10798,"FOUR, 122.6kph, back of a length, slow, but there's width, generous width. batsman stays on his back foot, and cuts away through point, beating third man comfortably"
10799,"FOUR, 120.2kph, whacks it alright. Kumar once again loses his line on the change of pace, keeping it short and wide outside off. batsman - for a change - doesn't commit early, waiting on it to slap it through sweeper"
10800,"out Caught by Priyam Garg!! bowler, rare loop, rarer flight and a Rishabh batsman freaky sweep -- mix it, and a disaster's a certainty. So it starts with batsman premeditatingly shuffling across his stumps, Khan tossing it up on leg-stump, extracting bounce, getting the top-edge and going down deep square leg's throat. batsman c Priyam Garg b bowler 28(27) [4s-1 6s-2]"
10801,"out Lbw!! LBW reviewed compulsively with the knowledge that he's the last remaining batsman with the skill to stand up to this bully of a bowling attack. Natarajan keeps it the same, very full, on middle, and batsman in a hope to manufacture something funky out of this, shuffles across, misses his flick and finds himself plumb in front of middle. Yea, that's exactly what HawkEys also says - hitting the base of off in three reds, dark reds. batsman lbw b bowler 11(9) [4s-1]"
10802,"FOUR, 139.5kph, full toss. batsman slices, has his bat turning in his palms, but still has enough in it to chip it over extra cover, and beat Rashid's sliding dive from sweeper"
10803,"2 runs, dropped -- and it's Manish Pandey of all people .. batsman holds his pose on the one-kneed high-elbowed punch through the covers, which only finds long-off perfectly. Alas, too casual"
10804,"out Bowled!! Through him. A big hoick across the line, and not that he had much of a choice here did Patel, but clearly wasn't even close to the line, that manages to drift in through the air and come in with the angle to drag off the inside edge to leave an LED-lit mess behind. batsman b bowler 5(6)"
10805,"FOUR, shot of the evening so far! A fuller length delivery that jagged back in a little, batsman charged out of his crease, gave himself some room and presented a straight bat in lifting it over the bowler's head. Balance and timing in sync and then he poses for the cameras too"
10806,"SIX .. and he'll finally get his cover-chip-drive right, getting under this length and tonking it over long-off rather comfortably. Clearly team couldn't care less, in fact Warner's even celebrating while the ball's in trajectory"
10807,"FOUR, chipped over mid-on. Dances out of his crease without any trace of worry, converts it into a fullish delivery and holds his shape nicely. Hits it through the line and enough wood on it to get it sail over the fielder's head"
10808,"FOUR, batsman knows Iyer is biding his time, so he has to attack. Spots an overpitched delivery outside off, transfers his weight quickly forward and bashes it past cover. It was on the rise but just wide of the fielder and off it trickles away to the boundary"
10809,"FOUR, a junk from Ahmed and Iyer says thanks. Strays on the pads, Iyer gets inside the line and tucks it very fine"
10810,"FOUR, quality shot from Iyer. Made that look so easy. Natarajan pitches it up just outside off, Iyer stomps forward and lofts it magnificently over mid-off. He's getting a move on now"
10811,"out Caught by Abdul Samad!! Goneeee! Just needed two balls to get a breakthrough. Iyer wasn't in his zone tonight. Wanted to slice it over extra cover, the bat face turned in his hands at the point of contact and as a result of which, he skies it to deep cover. Samad runs in, doesn't panic and grabs it. His first catch in IPL and team have lost their second wicket. Rashid is thrilled. batsman c Abdul Samad b bowler 17(21) [4s-2]"
10812,"FOUR, excellent execution of the sweep. Preempted, went down and predicted the bowler to pitch it on leg-stump. Swept it wide of short fine leg and batsman earns a boundary"
10813,"FOUR, nicely played, tad too full and at the stumps, batsman stays deep in the crease and then gets enough power on the lofted on-drive, clears mid-on with ease and bounces away to the ropes"
10814,"FOUR, cracking shot, dropped short and wide of off, batsman makes room and clatters the cut behind square on the off-side, no one moved"
10815,"FOUR, brilliant placement! There is a long-on in place but batsman had got this well wide of that fielder who had no chance to cut it off. Bad ball from bowler though, too short and allowed batsman to sit back on the pull. He cleverly picked his spot"
10816,"out Caught by Rabada!! Weird shot from Pandey!! He had just come in and this isn't the easiest of surfaces to start on. Looks to take bowler on with the slog sweep but is done in flight and gets a top-edge that's pouched comfortably at deep mid-wicket. It's that longer part of the ground which undid team yesterday in Dubai, and just like that here in Abu Dhabi, has taken out Pandey today. He was clutching his hamstring last over, so did that play a role in this shot? Either ways, team aren't complaining. This is a fab phase for them. batsman c Rabada b bowler 3(5)"
10817,"1 run, slight hesitation but they get the single as extra cover can't get across. batsman drove this gently and wanted one from the outset but Bairstow was a bit unsure. It eventually goes down to long-off"
10818,"FOUR, chipped over a leaping extra cover! batsman was a bit in two minds as he played this, almost as an afterthought but did well to clear the infield eventually. Was looped wider outside off, and batsman didn't really get to the pitch but went through with the stroke. Picked his gap well"
10819,"FOUR, terrific placement! Fine leg and deep mid-wicket are the fielders on the leg-side boundary, so KW decides to ping that gap. Shuffles across early and gets inside the line to pull this short delivery that didn't rise as much to trouble batsman"
10820,"FOUR, what a shot! Mid-off up, the length had to be a tad short but batsman is ready for it. Stands tall and flat-bats this wide of mid-off. Lovely connection and it's raced away. Much-needed momentum for team"
10821,"FOUR, batsman is unleashing himself! Full and outside off, not the slower ball and batsman is across the stumps in a flash to play his typical pickup stroke. Dhawan at deep backward square leg tried to get across but couldn't"
10822,"FOUR, he is toying around with the field! Makes room this time and although it's a hard length from bowler, batsman biffs it over mid-on. Not a meaty connection but enough to clear the infield. What a gem of a knock this is turning out to be from the Kiwi in his first outing of the season"
10823,"2 runs, fifty for batsman and also the 50-run stand! Terrific yorker from bowler and batsman somehow digs this out between his legs, towards deep square leg. They run hard and though the second run was risky, JB is comfortably home. It's been an unconventional batsman innings so far, not that free-flowing but the crucial part is that he has adapted. Also a very handy partnership, this"
10824,"out Caught by Nortje!! You can't deny bowler for long at the death. He thrives in these situations and has struck a vital blow here. Cross-seamer from bowler, very full and batsman made room for the loft. Didn't get any timing whatsoever and absolutely sent this straight up into the night skies. We've seen many such ones dropped, but Nortje holds his composure and takes it near the deep mid-off region. batsman falls after an workman-like innings. batsman c Nortje b bowler 53(48) [4s-2 6s-1]"
10825,"FOUR, top-edge but goes to the fence! Another attempted swipe across the line, this is short and pacy, and it's no surprise that young Samad is very late. Slices this way over the keeper and very fine down to third man fence. They all count"
10826,"SIX, he's got hold of this one! Wow! First signs of Samad's abilities. In the slot alright and he's pumped this high over wide long-on. Brute force and to do it against a bowler of bowler's pace shows that the bloke has the talent for sure"
10827,"out Caught by Axar!! Holes out to deep mid-wicket. Slower ball, wide outside off and batsman has to really fetch this one. Looks to wrist this away but these are big dimensions on that part of the ground. Doesn't get the distance on the stroke and picks out the fielder to perfection. A priceless cameo from the NZ skipper though. batsman c Axar b bowler 41(26) [4s-5]"
10828,"1 run, a direct hit and even batsman's dive wouldn't have saved him - drilled the drive straight to extra-cover and set-off for a quick single - Shreyas Iyer was helped by some good bounce and has a shy at the bowler's end"
10829,"leg byes, 1 run, appeal for LBW - bowler liked it and Shreyas points towards the review. Only the height is a matter of concern, looked pretty adjacent to the stumps. It's a fair delivery and there's no bat on that, UltraEdge confirms it. It's umpire's call on hitting the stumps, batsman survives. Short of a length and the ball skidded through after pitching, batsman was early into the pull and is beaten, struck high on the thigh-pad and the ball is only clipping the bails of middle"
10830,"1 run, chance and Shreyas can't hold on - would have been a good catch had he held, the ball was always dying onto him, just got his fingertips, but the ball popped out. batsman is done in by the slowness of the pitch and is early into the shovel, lobbed off the inner half and towards mid-on"
10831,"SIX, cracking shot, batsman breaks the shackles at last - change of pace on this cutter from bowler, but the length was wide of off - batsman bends down on his knees and pumps the drive over cover - went a long way over the ropes for a maximum"
10832,"FOUR, back-to-back boundaries for batsman - this was a streaky one though, short of a length and on off, he was hopping across on the pull, gets an inside edge onto the thigh-pad and it rolls away to the third man ropes"
10833,"SIX, clubbed, nicely tossed up outside off, batsman gets down on his knees, picks the length early and plays the slog sweep over mid-wicket - hard, flat and over the ropes"
10834,"2 runs, good running from batsman, nudged a well flighted delivery in front of mid-wicket and the call was always for the second run - Bairstow responded and they complete it with ease"
10835,"SIX, lovely, the slower ball from bowler, but it's too full and right under batsman's arc - he clears his left leg and drills it back over the umpire's head, has enough power to sail over the ropes for a maximum"
10836,"FOUR, batsman sets himself up for the reverse sweep, gets a bottom edge and the ball runs fine, past Shaw at short third man and beats his chase to the ropes"
10837,"out Caught by Pant!! Another attempted reverse sweep and Pant reckons there was some glove on that. The Capitals have reviewed the caught behind call. This looks close, think batsman might be in trouble, looked like a feather on the glove. UltraEdge in and there's a minor spike when the ball is past batsman's gloves. That's enough for the third umpire to overturn the original call. batsman is OUT. Think it's a fair decision from the third umpire, Chris Gaffaney. The spike wasn't huge, but there seemed to be a deviation when the ball went past the gloves - batsman was attempting the reverse sweep to one that drifted across him - caught the glove and Pant stood low to hold on. A wicket against the run of play, the dangerous batsman departs. batsman c Pant b bowler 45(33) [4s-3 6s-2]"
10838,"SIX, has that gone the distance? Yeah, of course, it has! Right into the slot around off, slightly up, batsman shuffles a touch in the crease, gets underneath the length and clubs it over long-on for the first big one of this evening in Dubai"
10839,"out Caught by Riyan Parag!! Tewatia gets Rana. A floated delivery around off, batsman looks to take on bowler and fails in his quest to clear long-off. Lofts it high up in the air, but fails to get the distance. It's Riyan Parag who completes a safe catch in the deep. This has been the problem with Rana this season. He's getting those starts, but he's not really able to convert them. batsman c Riyan Parag b bowler 22(17) [4s-2 6s-1]"
10840,"FOUR, Archer is disappointed with himself. Overpitched flighted delivery and Gill drills the drive straight down the ground, Archer gets across from long-on and tries to stop it with one hand, the ball does not stick"
10841,"out Caught&Bowled!! And Archer strikes. He was brought back to take out Russell but Rajasthan won't mind this. The set batsman departs and it is two new batsmen out in the middle. 140.5kph back of a length delivery angled in to the right hander, Gill is a tad early into his flick and the leading edge balloons up, Archer calls for it and tumbles backwards as he completes the catch. batsman c and b bowler 47(34) [4s-5 6s-1]"
10842,"SIX, there he goes! First of the night for Dre Russ. Googly and batsman was waiting for it, it landed right in his arc and he went down on his knee to bludgeon it over cow corner"
10843,"SIX, number 2! Gopal is erring in line and batsman is not one to miss out. This one drifts in on leg-stump, batsman clears his front leg and muscles it flat over deep mid-wicket. The fielder was left as a spectator"
10844,"out Caught by Buttler!! Archer is on fire. This is a jaffa to remove the team captain. A typical Archer wicket. Pounds it hard at 147.3kph on back of a length and gets it to straighten a tad, just a tad and batsman ended up playing the wrong line, the outside edge settled nicely into Buttler's mitts. batsman c Buttler b bowler 1(3)"
10845,"SIX, this is a buffet delivery for batsman. He is just waiting for that length - back of a length, he waits for the ball to arrive and pumps it flat over deep mid-wicket. Six #3!"
10846,"out Caught by Unadkat!! And gone! Rajasthan have their man. batsman cannot believe it as he walks back with both his hand along with the bat over his head. team in trouble now with half the side back in the dugout. There was a plan and bowler has bowled to it. Third man was up, deep backward point was in place and a deep extra cover. bowler went for the wide yorker and even nailed it, batsman bends down and slices it straight to Unadkat at deep backward point. That was right off the meat but the long boundaries did not help him there. batsman c Unadkat b bowler 24(14) [6s-3]"
10847,"FOUR, first boundary conceded by Archer. 121.4kph back of a length delivery, batsman had the width to work with and he times the pants off this backfoot punch, sweeper was not on the boundary line and he is not able to cut the angle as the ball races away to the fence"
10848,"SIX, oh no! Curran has palmed it over the rope. Short and angled across the left hander, batsman uses the space on offer to play the upper cut to deep backward point, Curran runs across and he is thinking of parrying the ball in even before catching it, in the end he allows it to slip past his grasp"
10849,"FOUR, batsman is switching gears now. But he is aided by Curran here. Juicy full toss outside off, batsman moves across and slaps it over extra cover, no chance for the sweeper cover"
10850,"out Caught by Samson!! Wow! Has Samson hurt his head? Landed badly on it. Slower short ball and batsman takes it on, he miscues the pull to deep backward square, Samson misjudges it slightly as he overruns it but adjusts well to leap up and take it over his head, he tumbles backwards and that's when he hits his head onto the ground. Seems to be fine.. batsman c Samson b bowler 12(10) [4s-1]"
10851,"1 run, full and close to yorker length, Nagarkoti jams it out to long-on"
10852,"FOUR, that's poor planning by bowler. With mid-off inside the ring he dishes out a half volley outside off, Nagarkoti just needs to clear the infield and he does that quite comfortably, well over Smith and the ball races away to the fence"
10853,"SIX, and he's got the distance. It was in the air for a long time but he had made enough connection to beat deep mid-wicket. Slower short of length delivery and it sat up nicely, batsman shuffles across and heaves it with a clean bat swing"
10854,"1 run, dropped! The ex team player has done them a favour. batsman could have been dismissed for a duck, but he has been given a life by Uthappa. Got deceived due to the slower one and ended up chipping it towards mid-on where the fielder puts down a dolly as he tries to reverse cup it"
10855,"FOUR, four runs! Will he make them pay for that dropped catch? A back of length delivery by bowler and batsman heaves it through mid-wicket as the fielder in the deep fails to stop it even after his dive, parrying it away to the boundary"
10856,"FOUR, short and punished! I mean it wasn't all that short, but batsman is quick to pick the length. Treks back in the crease does the opener and slams it through mid-wicket, that's four more! bowler proving to be slightly expensive"
10857,"SIX, that shall give him some confidence. Or rather, a lot of it. He's a confidence player. Picks the bones out of this slower delivery and smokes it over deep mid-wicket for half-a-dozen"
10858,"FOUR, each and every run will hurt Uthappa. A short of a length delivery around off, batsman reaches out for it and punches it through covers as he beats the fielder's dive inside the ring"
10859,"out Bowled!! Oh yeah, Robbie will be a relieved man! His prayers have worked, and the dropped catch hasn't cost much. bowler sticks to his slower ones and he has managed to knock down batsman. Rolled his fingers, pitched this one on a good length. batsman like always, swings and misses. Failed to get him in his previous over, but has managed to get his man eventually. First wicket for bowler this season. batsman b bowler 15(14) [4s-2 6s-1]"
10860,"FOUR, finally batsman gets off the mark. Was waiting for a loose delivery and he has latched onto it with both hands. Throws the kitchen sink at this short and wide ball and cuts it over backward point as the fielder in the deep couldn't do nothing about it"
10861,"FOUR, a half-tracker by bowler and it has spoiled the over for him. Was proving to be quite economical till then. Gill rocks back in his crease and hammers the pull as it beats the sprinter at deep mid-wicket. Bowled well against Rana, but not so well against Gill"
10862,"SIX, Rana welcomes bowler with a maximum. A loopy delivery around off and the shouthpaw has lofted it over wide long-off with impeccable timing, looked a six the moment he connnected that"
10863,"FOUR, such an artist! This was darted around middle and leg, batsman waits for it to arrive and heaves it into the huge gap at deep mid-wicket"
10864,"FOUR, smashed down the ground! batsman into his 40s as he makes sure to make the bowler pay for pitching this one up. Played it straight as an arrow as the fielder at long-on couldn't get there"
10865,"FOUR, Samson dives at deep point, but this kept curving away from him. Was a short ball again and batsman's square-cut fetched him four runs"
10866,"SIX, has that gone the distance? Yeah, of course, it has! Right into the slot around off, slightly up, batsman shuffles a touch in the crease, gets underneath the length and clubs it over long-on for the first big one of this evening in Dubai"
10867,"out Caught by Riyan Parag!! Tewatia gets Rana. A floated delivery around off, batsman looks to take on bowler and fails in his quest to clear long-off.

10894,"FOUR, if the idea was to surprise batsman first ball with a short one, it hasn't worked. He's in position quickly, leaning back, hitting the pull over square leg. Did take the eyes off it eventually, but still got it crack off the middle"
10895,"FOUR, the short ball didn't work against Agarwal.. it almost did against batsman. Hits him high on the bat as he pulls. No control as it flies to the left of Krunal but he can't get to it at long leg"
10896,"FOUR, backs away, receives one that is pounded in on short of length and slaps it over cover. Some form these blokes are carrying, and the confidence is on show"
10897,"leg byes, 1 run, batsman tried to slog-sweep the googly and missed, luckily the ball pitched outside leg stump. Mumbai needlessly reviewed, only to lose. QdK was blinded by the batsman, so he couldn't tell the full story"
10898,"SIX, Nic batsman in the house folks! Back in his crease as he tonks the short ball over long-on for a huge six"
10899,"FOUR, harmless short of length delivery, sits up nicely, batsman powers off the back foot over mid-wicket. He's keeping them in the game big time. Mumbai will want to hunt him down quickly"
10900,"2 runs, in the airrr, Hardik Pandya can't get there. batsman sliced this lofted drive as bowler floated a full one, looked like pace off that, Hardik had a lot of ground to cover, he had to skate to get there"
10901,"out Caught by de Kock!! A game of angles, nothing else folks. You would think how on earth did a set batsman of batsman's ability not muscle that juicy full ball over the ropes. but there's a lot on the technical side in this game. batsman took the invitation without knowing there was trap, he swung too hard and lost a bit of shape which is why he couldn't find the middle. Edge to QdK who takes a simple catch. A lot of times people wonder why Cottrell and not Jordan in a team. It's all about the angles. Left-arm angle to right-handeed batsman isn't all that easy. batsman c de Kock b bowler 44(27) [4s-3 6s-2]"
10902,"out Caught by Boult!! Okay it's so simple. If you have a leggie in your team, make him bowl into the wicket/not too full and get it to turn outside off stump, batsman can't resist slogging across the line, unfortuanly the bat keeps turning in his hands and he slices them. This had a lot of height as he tried to fetch a pull shot, Boult moved a few paces forward and catches it. batsman c Boult b bowler 11(18)"
10903,"out Caught by Suryakumar Yadav!! Caught off a high full toss, they are checking but it's just below the waist and a legal delivery. When it's not your day even the full toss go to fielders. batsman wanted to smash over mid-wicket, miscued it high and actually a good grab running back from backward point over his right shoulder.batsman c Suryakumar Yadav b bowler 7(7)"
10904,"FOUR, now that makes a lot of sense, third man is in, third man Sarfaraz plays the reverse slog and connects really well. Clears the infield and it's a boundary"
10905,"out Lbw!! That's a toe-crusher at the base of leg stump. Sarfaraz couldn't get that away with the attempted flick shot, ump raised the finger. Batsman reviewed, but he knew he was a goner. batsman lbw b bowler 7(8) [4s-1]"
10906,"out Caught by Suryakumar Yadav!! SKY has been really busy in the last few minutes. Full and into the sticks, Bishnoi actually squeezed that well, but hit it straight to backward point. The fielding show should lift SKY after the run-out today. batsman c Suryakumar Yadav b bowler 1(5)"
10907,"FOUR, sliced with one hand, full and outside off stump, pace off, so batsman was deceived but he went through with the loft, clears short third man"
10908,"SIX, in the airrr and just over Pollard at long-off. bowler went full and outside off stump, batsman toe-ended the loft, Pollard jumped on the boundary but it evaded him"
10909,"FOUR, short delivery, batsman backs away and guides, gets it fine and over the keeper"
10910,"FOUR, proper batting from a proper batsman. Short of length outside off, batsman waits long enough on it as he steers the ball fine to beat Hardik at deep backward point"
10911,"out Bowled!! Castled! Massive breakthrough as bowler goes right through a dangerous batsman. Pitched right up, finds movement off the seam as it comes in off the deck. batsman hadn't bargained for it. He threw his hands on the drive without any footwork. It's a shot you play on a flat pitch. This, however, has something in it. Bowls him through the gate. batsman b bowler 25(18) [4s-3]"
10912,"out Bowled!! batsman chops on! He attempts to cut this ball away from close to off stump but never has enough room to do so, despite his effort of stepping into the leg-side. The length isn't all that short either. Been up and down the order in this tournament, and this duck will only add to the pressure. batsman b bowler 0(3)"
10913,"SIX, this is why Krunal was afraid to get anything close to him. The slog-sweep has gone miles. batsman shuffles across, fetches it from a length outside off and finishes it"
10914,"FOUR, wide yorker outside off, runs away for four off the outside edge. One of the pitfalls with Krunal firing them in. No chance for short third man"
10915,"out Bowled!! batsman steps across to paddle sweep and is bowled behind his legs. Oh what a massive wicket. Just went too far and then missed it, getting done by the pace at which this skidded through. Probably only clips the leg bail, but that's all it had to do. Mumbai in control now. batsman b bowler 17(19) [4s-1]"
10916,"FOUR, what a response. Flays this through backward point. And it's not all that short either. But the width is there from bowler and batsman jumps all over it"
10917,"out Bowled!! Cleans him up, right through everything. It's that pre-covid-Starc dismissal -- which Quinton's looking to whip against the outswing. Clearly he's in no position to connect, but bowler's perfectly in position and pose in his salute. batsman b bowler 0(5)"
10918,"FOUR, absolute overcook outside off. Sharma leans, drives, and creams it through the covers to help himself past 5000 IPL runs"
10919,"FOUR, now the back-footed punch, typically batsman, standing on the bounce, arching behind and nailing this between point and cover"
10920,"SIX, that's into the stands! A loopy delivery around middle, batsman shuffles across, goes down on his knee and smokes it over deep mid-wicket for a massive six. 84 metre maximum that!"
10921,"1 run, 50-run stand up as batsman nudges the shortish delivery through mid-wicket for one. Need to up the ante now that both the batsmen have got their eye in"
10922,"1 run, dropped by Bishnoi at deep mid-wicket. batsman had completely mistimed the pull shot, but the fielder running in couldn't latch onto the catch. Was a good effort to get there with a sprint, just that the end result wasn't in the fielder's favour. Was a short ball that induced a top-edge"
10923,"out Caught by Nair!! batsman's struggle comes to an end. Probably, a blessing in disguise for Mumbai Indians. Time for Pollard and the Pandya brothers to take charge from here on. Was down on his knee to play the slogsweep as Kishan finds the man at deep mid-wicket. Two contrasting knocks for Kishan then. 99 the other night, and only 28 tonight. More importantly, he has used up too many deliveries in this innings. batsman c Nair b bowler 28(32) [4s-1 6s-1]"
10924,"SIX, how easy was that for him? Stands tall and nonchalantly lofts the tossed up googly over long-on for half-a-dozen. Pressure on the young wrist spinner"
10925,"SIX, got out to a half-tracker in the previous game, but not this time. Rocks back and manages to beat the fielder at deep mid-wicket by quite some distance. Wasn't in complete control of this pull, but the timing was good enough to go the distance, and it was also the shorter boundary that he targeted"
10926,"FOUR, fifty for the Mumbai skipper and he gets there with a boundary. 5000 runs earlier in the day, and now a good fifty-plus innings. Premeditates this one and scoops the full toss towards the fine leg fence. Almost cleared the boundary there"
10927,"FOUR, time to roll! Full toss around off and it has been creamed past the diving man at extra cover, no stopping that"
10928,"SIX, yeah, that's what I was talking about! So pleasing to the eyes. Short ball around middle and leg, ""batsman has more than a second to spot the length,"" as Kohli says. Doesn't even need to transfer his weight as he pulls it over deep square leg. 86 metres!"
10929,"SIX, such a talent! Goes inside out, plays with the field and lofts the pitched up delivery over deep extra cover. Raining sixes in Abu Dhabi!"
10930,"out Caught by Neesham!! Tag-team effort by Maxwell and Neesham has helped Punjab get rid of the Hitman. Maxwell did all the hard work there, but Neesham makes sure that his effort isn't in vain. Was lofted towards long-off by batsman as Maxy grabbed it and just when he was about to overhaul the boundary, he parried it to Neesham who was charging across from long-on. bowler has been the strike bowler for Punjab this season, and here's why. batsman c Neesham b bowler 70(45) [4s-8 6s-3]"
10931,"no run, batsman reviews! He was adjudged lbw here by the umpire, but he has straight away signaled for a review. Think there was some bat on it, as I look at the replays. Was a low full toss on leg that batsman failed to middle. Luckily for him there was some bat on it. So the onfield decision has to be overturned. The original decision was out, hence although he got some bat on it, it will be called as a dead ball"
10932,"SIX, stand and deliver! Short of a length delivery around off, batsman reads the length early and lofts it over the leaping Maxwell at long-on. He can attack right from the word 'go', hence he's so crucial towards these later stages"
10933,"FOUR, no stopping that! Backs away, manufactures room and whacks the shortish delivery at he manages to beat the fielder at deep extra cover this time around"
10934,"FOUR, Punjab leaking runs towards the closing stages. Their bowlers are running out of ideas. This was slightly wide outside off and batsman slams it through deep extra cover for another scintillating boundary. bowler stands there in disbelief"
10935,"FOUR, a short and wide ball with third man inside the ring? batsman is not going to miss out on those as he plays an upper cut and finds the fence at square third man"
10936,"FOUR, that's an edge, but it won't matter. Was a really full ball around off, seaming away from batsman who goes at it with hard hands. As the ball shapes away from him, it takes an outside edge and runs past the man at short third man"
10937,"FOUR, slammed! Goes deep in his crease and pulls the short ball to the deep mid-wicket fence with that meaty swing of his"
10938,"FOUR, 19 runs off the 19th over. A full toss to end the over as batsman flicks it over square leg. The fielder was inside the ring, hence Polly will get four more"
10939,"SIX, the last ball he smacked back to the bowler, but this one he has smacked out of the park. Right into the slot around middle as batsman smokes it over deep mid-wicket. High and handsome!"
10940,"SIX, the carnage continues! Pitched up by bowler, and although it was wide - batsman manages to reach for it as he tonks it right over the bowler's head, and into the sightscreen"
10941,"SIX, 97 metre six! A floated delivery around middle and leg, batsman gets under it and clubs it over deep mid-wicket for six more"
10942,"no run, Mumbai review this given LBW: Full, straightening back in off the pitch, and batsman's trapped on the front pad in his crease. But, but, the impact's in front of leg-stump, and ball-tracking shows it to be going down leg. False alarm, and batsman will stay there"
10943,"FOUR, perfect cover drill -- big plonk in front, leaning through the line, still head, high elbows and the fullest of bat-faces in bisecting the two men out there"
10944,"FOUR, and the covers again. It wasn't all that full, and Yadav's going through with what's more a punch this time, and the rest is the same (2.4)"
10945,"SIX, vintage batsman finishes off the innings in style. A hat-trick of sixes for the big man as he bludgeons this one over the bowler's head. Mumbai end with 191/4"
10946,"out Suryakumar Yadav Run Out!! Direct hit, and Punjab are already celebrating. Yadav clearly underestimates Shami - the short fine leg - as batsman's sweep goes to his right and decides to take his aim and his arm on with the quick single. Yea, nothing helps when it's a direct hit, not even a full stretch, and just like that, Surya finds himself run-out for the second time in these four games. Suryakumar Yadav run out (Shami) 10(7) [4s-2]"
10947,"FOUR, carved over cover, which Pooran chases and appears to have pulled back at the boundary. But no, he isn't all that good, for when his fingers are on the ball, his elbow's on the rope"
10948,"FOUR, jumps away, gives himself room and punches against the spin. That's not the fun part. The fun starts when this seeming push ends up splitting mid-off and extra cover. Wow"
10949,"FOUR, there's no point, literally. But bowler dishes out width off a shortened length and allows Sharma to go behind and cut it square"
10950,"FOUR, leg-cutter. Seams away. batsman gets squared, and edges it straight to first slip. Well, well. There's no first slip, and third man can't come around either"
10951,"1 run, bodyline, swatted round the corner"
10952,"FOUR, delicately cut late. Cute. Bishnoi gives it some flight, but then gets it to dip short and wide allowing Sharma a rock behind and a carve between point and short third man"
10953,"FOUR, stand and deliver! A tossed up delivery by bowler, goes a touch full and batsman slams it past the bowler. bowler hardly had any time to react, but believe me, had he got his hands to it, he could've been seriously injured. It was hit so hard!"
10954,"FOUR, and that shall release some pressure! bowler in his quest for the yorker, bowls a low full toss and batsman makes full use of it. Times his flick to perfection and manages to find the fence at deep square leg"
10955,"SIX, here we go! batsman is down the wicket as he tonks the tossed up delivery over long-on for a 84 metre six. There was a fielder sprinting across in the deep, but this cleared him comfortably.."
10956,"leg byes, 1 run, team review. It's a referral against batsman for an lbw. But I think this was sliding down the leg side, and Hyderabad will lose their review in that case.. As I look at the replays, it's pitching outside leg as well. batsman tried to whip it through the on side, but couldn't connect it.."
10957,"FOUR, and this time he has managed to beat that fielder, has MSD. Was a half-tracker by bowler and the team skipper has timed his pull and placed it into the gap at deep square leg"
10958,"FOUR, edged, but safe! Short of a length on leg, batsman swings across the line and gets a under-edge that dips in front of Bairstow, beats his dive and finds the fence"
10959,"FOUR, 50-run stand up for the fifth wicket! bowler immediately has a change in the field. Goes short and batsman makes sure to send it away to the fence. Hooks it over the fielder at short fine leg for four more.."
10960,"FOUR, that's a hat-trick of boundaries. Spears a full ball down the leg side and batsman has glanced it away to the fine leg fence. Just had to get a faint tickle, which Jaddu managed to pull off.."
10961,"FOUR, dropped by Pandey! That was a tough chance, but you can expect Manish to take those. That's the standard he sets in the field. Was a full ball by Natarajan and batsman miscued his loft towards deep mid-off where he was put down. The ball was eventually parried away to the fence"
10962,"SIX, fifty for batsman! Please move him up the order. A full toss on leg and the southpaw heaves it over deep square leg as he brings out a rather tired sword celebration"
10963,"out Caught by Abdul Samad!! batsman departs after an enterprising knock. Gets a short ball to have a go after and he has swung it straight to Samad at deep square leg. Looked a slightly tired shot, but he has made up for that strike rate. Was struggling initially, but this innings will give him some confidence going forward. batsman c Abdul Samad b bowler 50(35) [4s-5 6s-2]"
10964,"SIX, that's the first ball batsman's facing and he has struck the biggest six of the night. A short ball by Natarajan and batsman pulls it over deep square leg as it goes deep into the stands. WoW!"
10965,"FOUR, ""that's a terrible misfield,"" reckons Slater on air. batsman slogs the length ball towards deep mid-wicket where Samad charges in, takes his eyes off the ball as he tries to grab the ball, and makes complete mess of it.."
10966,"SIX, so the break has helped. It has helped him regain his focus. Picks the bones out of this slower short ball and thumps it over deep mid-wicket for a flat six"
10967,"FOUR, and the equation is down to 17 off 4 balls! A tossed up delivery by bowler and batsman has smashed it right past the bowler, it's four more.."
10968,"out Bowled!! Chopped on - Have to say this was coming, batsman was never at home against bowler - short of a length and just outside off, a flat-footed batsman aimed at the cut, cramped for room - all he managed was a big inside edge, the ball bounced back onto the off-stump and the lightened up bails signals batsman's sorry exit. team have once again lost an early wicket in this season's tournament. batsman b bowler 1(6)"
10969,"SIX, the last ball of the match has gone the distance! But, Chennai Super Kings face their third straight loss after winning the tournament opener. Gets to the pitch of the delivery does batsman and thumps it right over the bowler's head for half-a-dozen!"
10970,"FOUR, batsman is up and away, low full-toss and he has whipped it past mid-wicket - the man at deep square leg has no chance - a boundary to break the shackles for team"
10971,"FOUR, smashed, team need to get going and batsman will start playing his shots - came down the track and drilled this short ball wide of cover - Warner gives chase, but he was always coming second best"
10972,"FOUR, cheeky and four, a pre-meditated paddle from batsman, got down low, waited on the ball and then scooped it over fine leg's head, the fielder was inside the ring and has no chance"
10973,"out Bowled!! A peach and the in-form batsman has been sent packing. Lapse in concentration? Could be the case, but this was a cracker of a delivery from the Tamil Nadu pacer - hit the deck hard around leg and then seamed away sharply - batsman was completely opened up as he looked to tuck, past the closed the bat-face and the ball went on to hit the top of off-stump. A dream dismissal for any left-arm pacer. batsman b bowler 8(9) [4s-1]"
10974,"FOUR, clubbed, excellent use of the feet from batsman, waited until the ball left Natarajan's hand, shimmied down the track and then lifted it back over the umpire's head for a boundary"
10975,"FOUR, change of tactics from batsman - he's going to be the aggressor - came down the track, Natarajan responded by bowling short and wide - batsman uses his reach and thwacks it back over the umpire's head for another boundary"
10976,"out du Plessis Run Out!! A direct hit would have definitely run du Plessis OUT, but is he still short? Great work from Bairstow as he pushed the ball at the stumps. du Plessis is definitely short, but was it the ball hitting the stumps or did Bairstow break the stumps without the ball in his hand? Actually, the ball slipped out of his hands, but think it inadvertently went on to hit the stumps. OUT is the call. That's a massive blow for the Super Kings - the in-form du Plessis has been sent packing. Never a run there and Kedar must cop the blame for it - tucked it to the right of mid-wicket and set-off for a single. Garg was quick on the ball and has a shy at the striker's end - he missed, but Bairstow was covering for the throw. The ball did slip out of his hands, but luckily for him, it fell onto the stumps. Either way, du Plessis was well short. Replays suggest that du Plessis didn't really sense the danger first-up, was a bit slow to start and by the time he realised his mistake, it was all too late. du Plessis run out (Priyam Garg/Bairstow) 22(19) [4s-4]"
10977,out Caught by Warner!! Chennai in trouble as they've lost almost half of their side. bowler strikes in his first over. Played a handy cameo a few days ago and strikes right away today. Tempts the batsman with a loopy legbreak around off and Kedar chips it straight to the team skipper at covers. Good reflexes shown by Warner as he completes the catch and isn't he delighted? batsman c Warner b bowler 3(10)
10978,"out Bowled!! Gets him with a peach of an inswinger. Full and swinging in towards middle and off, batsman looks to flick over mid-wicket and plays all around it. Gets completely beaten by the inward movement and the woodwork is all over the place.batsman b bowler 0(3)"
10979,"FOUR, edged and four! Full away swinger and draws batsman into a drive away from the body, Pandey goes hard and the edge goes flying down to the third man fence"
10980,"FOUR, anything pitched up and batsman is not gonna let it go scot-free. Maintains solid base and crunches the loft over mid-off, bowler's pace takes care of the rest"
10981,"FOUR, lovely placement from batsman! Gives himself a bit of room and sits on one knee to pull this short ball in the gap between deep mid-wicket and deep square"
10982,"out Caught by du Plessis!! Faf is making a habit of pulling off these boundary-flirting catches and he makes it look so easy. batsman is disappointed and he knew he was in trouble from the moment it left the bat. Huge wicket for team. batsman danced down the track and perhaps got a little too close to the pitch of the delivery, miscues the loft off the toe-end, it did seem like going for a maximum but there's always a risk involved when you take on a fielder like Faf. He Leaps up full length, grabs the ball on the jump and quickly realizes, he's gonna go over the ropes. What does he do then? Just maintains his composure, lobs the ball in the air before going over the ropes and collects the ball with ease on the second attempt. batsman c du Plessis b bowler 28(29) [4s-3]"
10983,"out batsman Run Out!! This is disaster of the highest class. batsman flicks it to mid-wicket and calls for a quick single, Priyam Garg barely responded and batsman was left stranded mid-pitch. There was never a single there and Rayudu at mid-wicket had all the time in the world to lob the ball to Dhoni who does the rest. He looks upset, not sure if it was his call, but having played it to the right of mid-wicket, there was no single on there. batsman run out (Rayudu/Dhoni) 9(13) [4s-1]"
10984,"FOUR, full and sliding down the leg-side, Abhishek uses the line to broom it fine past the keeper for an easy boundary"
10985,"FOUR, nicely played - a little counter-punch from young Abhishek - bends down half-way, uses the pace on the ball and plays the reverse pull, behind square on the off-side for a boundary"
10986,"SIX, lovely, RJ doesn't learn, tosses one just outside off, Abhishek gets across, plays with the angle and swings it high and over mid-wicket for a maximum"
10987,"FOUR, cracking shot, too full and too wide of off from Bravo, almost a half-volley length and Abhishek can get under it on the drive - has enough power to clear mid-off and rolls away to the ropes"
10988,"FOUR, lovely - Garg is making most of this opportunity to bat time - had a part in the run-out of KW, but that hasn't figured in his plan since - tad too short and he's very quick on the pull, swivels across, rolls his wrists and pulls it over square leg for a boundary"
10989,"FOUR, beautifully played, a touch of class from Garg - overpitched and well wide of off, he leant into the drive, opened the bat-face at the last moment and sliced the drive behind square on the off-side for a boundary"
10990,"SIX, this is batting of the highest quality from young Garg - full and coming back into the right-hander, from that round the wicket angle - he bends low, picks the length early and slaps it over square leg for a maximum"
10991,"no ball, FOUR, back-to-back boundaries for Garg - this is a no-ball for height as well - high full-toss outside off, Garg makes room and lifts it over backward point for a boundary"
10992,"FOUR, cute, Garg is taking Curran to the cleaners - another proper cricketing shot, back of a length and well wide of off, he waited on it, opened the bat face and ran it behind square on the off-side, third man was inside the ring and has no chance"
10993,"FOUR, chance and dropped - and it's by RJ of all people - length ball outside off and Sharma swiped it over square leg. RJ ran across to his left, got there with plenty of time, got both hands and then let the ball burst through - to add insult to injury, it dribbled over the ropes"
10994,"1 run, another chance and Shardul has put down a sitter - butter fingers all of a sudden from team, on a good length and angling across the left-hander, Abhishek was looking to go inside out over cover - the bat-face turned on impact and he carved it over point - Shardul had plenty of time on the ball and somehow makes a mess of it"
10995,"FOUR, top-edge and four, banged in short and just outside off, Garg was a tad late on the pull, the ball caught the fat top-edge and lobbed over MS for another boundary"
10996,"out Caught by Dhoni!! Abhishek's fun-filled innings is over, but he has done his job. Banged in short and angling across the left-hander, the attempted slower bouncer from bowler - Abhishek was looking to nail the pull wide of mid-wicket, gets an audible edge and MS does the rest. batsman c Dhoni b bowler 31(24) [4s-4 6s-1]"
10997,"FOUR, Garg continues to ooze class - knew that Bravo would be bowling a slower ball, went right across on the paddle sweep and clears backward square leg. MS isn't looking all that impressed"
10998,"1 run, Maiden IPL fifty for Garg, first of many to come? Low full-toss on the pads and it's clipped past square leg for a single"
10999,"FOUR, class from batsman! Sees the outswinger pitch in the fullish zone and shows the full face of the bat to silk a gorgeous straight drive past mid-off. Too good!!"
11000,"FOUR, batsman unleashing! Gets a full delivery in his zone and he clubs it straight back over the bowler's head for a delightful-looking boundary"
11001,"FOUR, 136ks length ball outside off, Pandey picks it up from wide of off and swats it over Bravo at mid-on, easy pickings for the batsman"
11002,"FOUR, half-volley on off-stump and batsman will not miss out. Unleashes those powerful bottom hand as he chips the loifted drive straight down the ground, straight as an arrow!!"
11003,"out Caught by Sam Curran!! batsman perishes and instantly shadow-practices the execution. It was a cross-seam delivery from Shardul Thakur and the length - full - lured Pandey to go for big shot. He looks to slap-drive it over mid-off but doesn't get the timing right, skews it off the thick toe-end and offers catching practice to Curran at mid-off. batsman c Sam Curran b bowler 29(21) [4s-5]"
11004,"FOUR, just needed one delivery to get his timing right and it's pure class flowing from the bat of Kane batsman! Gets into superb position as he jumps on this full ball and creams the drive sweetly past the diving left hand of cover"
11005,"FOUR, a quicker one from bowler and batsman makes use of the pace to reverse slap it past the diving left hand of Watson at backward point. Got great power behind the shot did the team skipper"
11006,"FOUR, lifts this over the in-field on the off-side. batsman is off the mark with a four. This should ease his nerves a bit. Too short, too wide and batsman will not let this go scot-free. Rides the bounce and makes hay"
11007,"SIX, where has this gone? Monster hit from Padikkal. Remember him playing a similar kind of shot in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, he's so good with the flicks and glances. bowler bowls the inswinger onto his pads, Padikkal says thanks and decimates it a long way into the grass banks at deep square leg"
11008,"FOUR, bashed over mid-wicket. The shot of a man in prime form. Not all that short from bowler, but Padikkal quickly read the length, camped back and took heavy toll of it"
11009,"FOUR, deft! 108.7kph, slower ball around off, Padikkal spots it, waits for the ball and opens his bat-face at the last moment to guide it cheekily fine of the man at short third man. Third half-ton in four matches for batsman! Brilliant"
11010,"FOUR, slapped over extra cover! That went like a bullet. batsman shimmies down the pitch and Parag shortens his length. There's ample width and batsman flayed it powerfully!"
11011,"SIX, even better! Parag bowls a full one, right in the slot. batsman makes room by moving leg-side and lofts it handsomely over deep extra cover. Superb inside-out from the skipper. This is the batsman we know...."
11012,"2 runs, 88.1kph, batsman jogs down the pitch and hammers it over the bowler's head. Tewatia got fingertips to it and the long-off fielder put in a dive to his right to save a couple of runs. tough to call it a drop! That came towards the bowler very quickly"
11013,"SIX, shot! batsman is definitely finding his touch! Dances down the track to this flighted delivery, gets to the pitch of the ball and tonks it powerfully over long-on. Moves to 49!"
11014,"1 run, you can't keep him silent for long! Beware, other IPL teams! Fifty for Virat batsman and he reaches there by dinking a full ball down to long-on"
11015,"FOUR, 142.6kph, short ball from Archer, it was on the stumps. But, Padikkal walks away towards the leg-side which allows his free arms and plays an aerial cut shot over backward point. A one-bounce four and Padikkal made it look so easy"
11016,"out Bowled!! Timber! 145.7kph, very full and attacking the sticks from round the wicket, Padikkal backs away a long way and is too late to bring his horizontal bat down. Crashes into the base of off and middle. First wicket for Archer, is it too late though? batsman b bowler 63(45) [4s-6 6s-1]"
11017,"FOUR, wow! A fullish ball at 133.8kph, batsman shimmies down the pitch, converts it into a half-volley and drives it exquisitely straight of the mid-off fielder. With mid-off inside the circle, it wasn't a great idea to bowl full. batsman took full toll of it"
11018,"FOUR, 124.4kph, slow, short and wide. batsman stands tall and throws his bat at it. Gets a fat top-edge that flies over the short third man fielder. Uthappa did run back and dived but to no avail"
11019,"FOUR, 16 runs off the over! batsman is in a hurry to finish this match. Another slower ball, shortish in length, batsman gets behind the line by shuffling across and pulls it nicely over backward square leg"
11020,"3 runs, 129kph, bowler probably saw the batter step down and shortened his length. batsman checks his lofted drive and the ball falls short of in-running-and-diving Gopal at long-off. Meanwhile, batsman runs three by the time Gopal recovers and releases the ball. Just incredible stuff..."
11021,"FOUR, low full toss, batsman crouches a bit and batters it to the right of Jofra at mid-on. Runs away to the fence and team win by 8 wickets"
11022,"FOUR, yes, he was right. It's indeed the googly but Gopal errs in length, getting it too short and following the batsman. batsman backed away too far but manages to hack it past square leg"
11023,"out Lbw!! It's that man again - bowler, who strikes for Rajasthan. He usually does well against team and has got a wicket in his first over. Flighted just outside off - the googly which spun back in - batsman was alerted by his partner about this threat, still he went low to sweep and failed to connect. The impact was in-line and the only question was whether it was hitting the stumps. Gopal was proved right and team have lost their first wicket. batsman lbw b bowler 8(7) [4s-2]"
11024,"FOUR, that's a poor delivery from Archer. Easy pickings for Padikkal. Drifts it on the pads, Padikkal moves across and just helps it fine past the man at 45"
11025,"FOUR, batsman's first boundary of IPL 2020! Whodathunk.. He's been having a lean patch and Gopal offered him a freebie. A rank long hop, batsman had all the time in the world to shift his weight back and pummel it to the deep backward square leg boundary"
11026,"FOUR, superb from Padikkal. Doesn't overhit this short ball, just waited for it and lifted his one leg to unleash a short-arm pull past the fielder at short fine leg. Bread and butter for him.. too leg-sidish from Curran, needs to shift his line to outside off"
11027,"FOUR, brute force. Nipping away outside off, plenty of room to free his arms and Padikkal seizes.. slapping it over extra cover with enviable timing!"
11028,"1 run, a proper miscue.. who wants it? Actually nobody as it falls safely at long-on. Was through the shot early, skews it up after losing his balance.. Padikkal gets away. Lady luck shining brightly on him so far"
11029,"FOUR, that's clumsy from the fielder at extra cover. This should've been stopped. I guess Lomror is the culprit, Smith ain't happy. A fuller length delivery just outside off, batsman just sublimely drives it crisply and sends it to extra cover where Lomror couldn't get his body in-line and fumbles. It scurries away to the boundary"
11030,"FOUR, wow! Those magical wrists of batsman coming into play. Went back upon seeing this darter on leg, just swatted it across the line through square leg and pierces the gap to perfection"
11031,"2 runs, great work from Tewatia at long-off. Padikkal drilled it powerfully along the ground, it was racing away quickly and Tewatia bolted to his right and keeps the ball in play. Two to Padikkal and it's 50-partnership between these two"
11032,"FOUR, loose ball and batsman has put it away. On the pads, shortish and batsman walks down to tuck it away easily wide of short fine leg who was a bit off the mark too. VK isn't amused with that"
11033,"FOUR, this is poor from bowler. He's getting the slow nature of the deck to assist him but instead of bowling tigher, feeds a boundary ball. Fed on the pads with fine leg up, batsman isn't missing out. Shuffles across and glances it wide of that fielder in the ring"
11034,"FOUR, third boundary of the innings and all have been to the same area - fine leg. Quicker one from Sundar, probably put off a bit by batsman's initial walk down the pitch and it's fed on the pads. Swept away past short fine leg"
11035,out Caught by Udana!! batsman looks to go big against bowler and he has found the man at long-off. Was a loopy legbreak around off and Robbie miscues it completely in his quest to clear the fence. Udana takes a comfortable catch in the deep and bowler has just bagged his second wicket of the match. Sunrisers were in a similar situation yesterday. 70/4 when two youngsters braved them out of trouble. batsman c Udana b bowler 17(22) [4s-1]
11036,"FOUR, finally connects one! A tossed up delivery on middle and leg, batsman waits for it to arrive and powers is past bowler. Straight as an arrow as this one races away to the fence in double quick time.."
11037,"SIX, this one's got the height.. and the distance! Enormous! batsman gets to the pitch of the ball and smokes it over long-on for a massive six. Was in the air for an eternity"
11038,"1 run, full toss outside off and it has been driven through covers by batsman for one"
11039,"out Caught by Finch!! The experience of bowler overcomes Parag. He looks to slap the short ball, but fails to get the distance. Mistimed to long-on where Finch moves forward and reverse cups it. Right then, time for the miracle man - Tewatia to come in and take charge. Do we have another Tewatia special on the cards? batsman c Finch b bowler 16(18) [4s-1]"
11040,"SIX, this is proving to be an enterprising knock by batsman! bowler at its receiving end once again, as the southpaw goes down on his knee and swings it over deep mid-wicket for half-a-dozen"
11041,"out Caught by Devdutt Padikkal!! bowler brings an end to batsman's stay! Keeps this one slightly wide outside off and the batsman has to reach out for it. Throws his hands at it, as the ball is miscued towards long-off where Padikkal isn't going to miss out. He'll be disappointed that he couldn't get a fifty. Right then, it's Jofra time.. batsman c Devdutt Padikkal b bowler 47(39) [4s-1 6s-3]"
11042,"SIX, that's the confidence he's carrying! On the pads and batsman helps it over the deep square leg fence. How nonchalant did he make that swipe look like?"
11043,"FOUR, french-cut by batsman as he swings hard and gets an inside edge on the full toss. The fielder at fine leg was inside the ring, hence this was an easy boundary"
11044,"SIX, that's Archer-ed! A slower delivery by bowler, on the shorter side and Jofra bludgeons his pull over deep mid-wicket for a flat six. All about power!"
11045,"no run, chance of a run-out, but bowler has made a mess of it. Tewatia was almost at the striker's end when Archer asked him to go back. But, bowler couldn't get rid of the ball quickly. Had he gone for a direct-hit at the bowler's end, Tewatia could have been in trouble. The throw wasn't an impressive one, as he parried it away towards the fielder who was charging in from mid-off. Was delivered on the pads as batsman failed to connect his flick"
11046,"SIX, and the free-hit is out of the park! The reply couldn't have been a better one. Length delivery by bowler and batsman swings it over deep square leg for a monster hit. Once again, team are proving to be expensive in their death overs"
11047,"SIX, dealing in sixes is Tewatia. Rahul - it's in the name! A full toss around off, batsman shuffles across and swipes it towards deep square leg as he manages to beat the fielder's leap near the boundary"
11048,"SIX, that's a batsman special! Wow! Slower ball, on a shorter length and not many can generate such power by standing in the crease. Waited that bit longer and unleashed his short-arm jab. Minimum fuss, maximum result"
11049,"FOUR, can't bowl short to batsman at this pace, bowler! Gonna get punished for sure. This is a harmless half-tracker on leg stump, batsman sits back and pulls this away through mid-wicket. Didn't middle it all that well, still got it to the fence"
11050,"out Bowled!! Chopped on! batsman is livid with himself. It was there to be hit, short and wide but the slowness of the deck, and the lack of bounce does him in. bowler had offered no pace and so, batsman's attempted cut stroke results in a big inside edge that disturbs the furniture. bowler is elated, his slower ball menu has finally found success. batsman b bowler 5(5) [4s-1]"
11051,"FOUR, how is that for a start? Gentle half-volley from bowler alright but look at that execution from batsman. Just leans into the drive and caresses the drive wide of mid-off. Class!"
11052,"out Caught by Devdutt Padikkal!! What a way to start your spell! This is a massive strike first-ball by Saini. The dangerous batsman is out of here. The umpires wanted to refer it upstairs for a bump ball but Jos was already walking. He knew it was a fair dismissal. Raw pace probably did him in here, very full and outside off, batsman tried to squeeze the drive but could only get a thick edge. Padikkal was placed at a wide slip, perhaps strategically and it's straight at him. Sharp low catch and team are absolutely pumped. Dream start for them. batsman c Devdutt Padikkal b bowler 22(12) [4s-3 6s-1]"
11053,"out Caught&Bowled!! And he strikes first-ball! What a catch from bowler! They're checking for a clean catch. Soft signal is OUT. Seemed alright in real time. Okay, the replays are quite confusing. It does seem like a bit of his fingers are under the ball, but also a portion of it seems to be touching the ground. The third umpire isn't sure but he feels there isn't enough evidence to overturn the onfield call. So, batsman has to walk. Huge, huge wicket this. Was doled out full by bowler and batsman moved leg-side to drive through the covers. Got it off the inside part of the bat and the ball was travelling to the right of the bowler. bowler stuck his right hand to pouch it. A very fine reflex attempt. team in disarray here. batsman c and b bowler 4(3) [4s-1]"
11054,"FOUR, brilliant effort by Gurkeerat at long-on! Raced across to his left and dived full-length but couldn't do much. Seemed like a mishit from batsman initially, went hard on the halfvolley from bowler but did well to go dead straight down the ground. One bounce into the ad hoardings"
11055,"1 run, fuller and on the pads, batsman flicks it away towards deep square leg"
11056,"SIX, huge blow! This boy is known to hit the ball long and hard, and this is a sample of that. Slot ball from bowler, leg break and batsman gets down on his knee to slog sweep this over deep mid-wicket. Clean strike and a much-needed blow for team"
11057,"FOUR, this is great awareness from batsman. Saw mid-off was up and wanted to get this past the fielder. Backed away for the flat-batted stroke and although he didn't get a big chunk of this, still had enough to beat the diving fielder in the circle"
11058,"FOUR, full pitched at the stumps, Shaw - with his high backlift - punches it sweetly over mid-on. With his flourish as it is, if the timing is good, he doesn't need to worry about clearing the infield"
11059,"FOUR, short ball angling across, batsman cuts from underneath it and gets it over short third man"
11060,"SIX, fifty for Shaw. Second of the season for him. He shakes hands with his skipper at the other end and then raises his bat to the dugout. Slower that is dragged back, Shaw backed away and though he had to reach for the flat-batted hit, he manages to clear the long-on boundary"
11061,"SIX, second six of the over. He bowled a similar delivery to Iyer early in the over and got away with it but not this time, the flick is uppish and the ball sails over the backward square leg fence"
11062,"1 run, patted in front of backward point and the pair cross over. The 50-partnership comes up between these two"
11063,"FOUR, edged and four. Flighted outside off, Shaw drives and the ball flies off the outside edge, runs away fine and Rana had no chance catching up with it"
11064,"SIX, oh my! This would have been a six in any ground. Googly around off-stump, Iyer keeps his head down and then has a clean bat swing to send it soaring into the roads over long-on"
11065,"FOUR, and a boundary to finish.. bowler does not want to pitch it on a length, so he errs on the shorter side, Iyer is waiting for it and flays the cut behind square - bisecting backward point and short third man"
11066,"SIX, small margins for error. Nagarkoti fails to nail the yorker, it is a juicy knee high full toss and though Shaw does not middle his pick up shot, half a decent connection on this ground is enough to take it all the way. Mavi could only watch it go over him near deep mid-wicket"
11067,"out Caught by Shubman Gill!! Nagarkoti has his man. He has gone for quite a few but this should give him some relief. [Pounded it back of a length and Shaw backed away to hack it into the leg-side, but only manages a toe-end towards long-on, Gill runs and settles nicely under it. A fine knock comes to an end. Can team apply brakes now? b]batsman c Shubman Gill b bowler 66(41) [4s-4 6s-4][/b]"
11068,"FOUR, shot! bowler tries the same full wide delivery to Iyer but ends up conceding the boundary. This was right in the slot for the Delhi skipper, uses his reach and lifts it handsomely over extra cover, one bounce and over the ropes"
11069,"wide, another wide, tries to keep it out of the southpaw's range and sprays it too far outside off, batsman has no chance of reaching that"
11070,"FOUR, Cummins was straighter at mid-off but batsman still manage to beat him. Full delivery outside off, batsman swings through the line past Iyer and Cummins had no chance of getting across"
11071,"FOUR, oh no! Cummins has made a mess of it. Meanwhile, Iyer reaches his fastest IPL fifty. He has to bat through and ensure his side get the total they need. Full delivery on middle and leg, Iyer flicks it uppishly to wide long-on, the ball lands just in front of Cummins and he ends up overrunning the ball."
11072,"FOUR, smashed! 141.2kph short of length delivery outside off, batsman sets himself up nicely and slaps it hard over extra cover, goes flat and almost all the way"
11073,"FOUR, not sure he intended that to go there but he won't mind it. Full delivery around off, batsman aims to drive it through extra cover, but the bat face turns and the ball ends up in front of square on the leg-side - splitting deep mid-wicket and long-on"
11074,"SIX, these small boundaries, I tell you. This was a miscue, right off the cue-end but the ball just clears the rope. A low full toss and Iyer didn't get it off the meat, but enough to clear cow corner"
11075,"FOUR, oh no! Even good deliveries are going for runs. Sloppy bit of work from Narine. bowler nails it in the blockhole, Iyer shuffles across and gets his bat down in the nick of time, squeezes it to short fine and Narine ends up diving over the ball. bowler is not impressed with the effort"
11076,"FOUR, hammered! He is putting on a show here. Keeps moving around in the crease, makes room as the ball is delivered and drives it with his weight on the back leg, pierces the gap between extra cover and mid-off"
11077,"SIX, that's outta here. Length delivery at this venue goes only one way - onto the roads. This was right in the swinging arc for batsman and he doesn't miss out, deposits it over deep mid-wicket"
11078,"FOUR, that's poor planning. He goes short with square leg and fine leg inside the ring, even the mistimed pull from batsman races away to the fence"
11079,"FOUR, batsman looks at the base of his bat. He knows that it didn't come off the middle. Full toss outside off and batsman swings it away in front of square on the leg-side, wide of the long-on fielder"
11080,"out Caught by Shivam Mavi!! Better from bowler. More the area he needs to bowl. This is right up there, near to yorker length, batsman goes deep in the crease and plays the helicopter, but doesn't get enough to clear long-on, Mavi does not have to move much as he takes a simple chance. A perfect cameo from batsman but he would have wanted to bat a bit longer. batsman c Shivam Mavi b bowler 38(17) [4s-5 6s-1]"
11081,"FOUR, first ball has disappeared to the fence. He dragged the length back and Iyer waited for it on the backfoot, muscles the pull in front of square on the leg-side - right between deep mid-wicket and long-on"
11082,"SIX, 12 off 3 balls. This delivery had width on it and Iyer picks his spot - deep extra cover, extends his arms and launches it with a clean bat swing over the rope"
11083,"SIX, 20 off the over. So the move didn't work. This flighted delivery lands right in the arc, Iyer clears his front leg to get a golf-like swing and he smashes it over deep mid-wicket. Can he get a hundred?"
11084,"out Caught by Chakravarthy!! batsman cannot believe it. He moved across his stumps and reaches out for a slow delivery way down leg, the cue-end balloons towards short fine and Chakravarthy takes a dolly. It would have been a wide had he let go but at this stage batsmen want to put bat on ball all the time. batsman c Chakravarthy b bowler 1(3)"
11085,"SIX, high and long. Right into the team dugout. bowler misses the yorker and it is a full delivery, batsman doesn't get hold of the loft but you don't need much to clear the fences here"
11086,"no run, this is excellent stuff from bowler. Another short ball that is banged into the surface, he slants it across the left hander and batsman cannot connect with the pull, the ball flies under his bat"
11087,"FOUR, bowler hits 151kph as he pounds it in on short of length, and is pulled over midwicket. Shaw didn't quite get hold of it though. Definitely a little rushed for pace. But enough meat on it"
11088,"SIX, now this has been crunched. Short of length into the body, 147kph, Shaw treats it with contempt as he pulls over midwicket. Skimmer!"
11089,"FOUR, batsman barely has a followthrough on this cover-drive, but the timing is sublime. Smears it over cover. bowler went too full there"
11090,"SIX, collects a six as he gently sweeps over square leg. Nicely on a length from bowler, batsman meets it with good timing"
11091,"SIX, six more with the sweep. Went a touch harder there, but once again the length is perfect for the shot. It goes further. Goes over the roof"
11092,"1 run, fires this short outside off, it spins back in slightly and batsman mistimes the cut wide of cover"
11093,"FOUR, Shaw seems like he's picking him. Or maybe it's just premeditated. Backs away to a length ball, it turns away from him and he cuts through cover"
11094,"out Caught by Morgan!! Has struck a couple of sixes with his sweep shot. This one though goes straight up off the top-edge. It was the one that turned away from batsman and got him closer to the toe-end, hence the error. Morgan is underneath the skier at square leg. Swirls under it. Eventually has to put in a bit of a dive, but grabs it with both hands. batsman c Morgan b bowler 26(16) [4s-2 6s-2]"
11095,"1 run, Shaw may have been struggling here. Have to confirm with the replay. But Morgan's under-arm flick running in from cover misses the mark. Would've been touch and go. It was Shaw's call anyway, so he had no one else to blame. Iyer was less sure after tapping this back of a length delivery into the off-side"
11096,"SIX, makes room to a length ball and slaps this over extra cover. Oh the wonders of batting in Sharjah, hitting through the line like this"
11097,"FOUR, driven hard enough to burst through Mavi's hands. Races away to the boundary. It wasn't an obvious drive-ball so to say, but it might as well be over here."
11098,"1 run, Shaw had given up at the non-striker's end. Cummins, from mid-off, misses the stumps but he has hit Shaw right on the boot. He looks in some pain, but is back up quickly"
11099,"SIX, Iyer's been made to fetch this from outside off. He does so and swipes over midwicket. Just clears the boundary with this 75-metre hit"
11100,"byes, FOUR, 138.7kph, sharp bumper first up, batsman is beaten - courtesy pacy and bounce. He is in no control to pull and misses it comfortably. Fies over the keeper's leap too"
11101,"out Bowled!! Knocked him over! bowler is pumped up. Another failure for batsman. 147.6kph, batsman is expecting a short ball, the bowler smartly bowls a length ball. The left-handed batter backs away in an attempt to hoick across the line. Too quick for him though. Gets beaten on the inside edge and the ball hits the top of leg. batsman b bowler 3(5)"
11102,"1 run, 149.6kph! Very full ball, Gill jams it out towards mid-off and sets off for a tight single. Iyer misses the target at the bowler's end. A direct hit would have been curtains for Gill"
11103,"2 runs, 120.3kph, off-lined yorker. Whipped round the corner, pinches the second, and team pinch a 100 .."
11104,"FOUR, slow, short, sitting up outside off. Rana finally finds a gap, rocking behind and slaps it backward of point"
11105,"1 run, slow, just outside off, and angling away. A quiet, neat run down to third man -- and fifty"
11106,"SIX, more in the slot, more of the obvious slower ones. Rana can line it up, swing, and hoick downtown"
11107,"out Caught by (sub)Axar!! It's not that Rana had much of a choice apart from hopeful bat-swings. But Patel had this shorter, slower, hence ruining the timing on Rana's attempted heave over mid-wicket. The miscue is a top-edge, and the Patel-unity will do it by the boundary. batsman c (sub)Axar b bowler 58(35) [4s-4 6s-4]"
11108,"out Caught by Dhawan!! And the game's killed. Go on, shake your sanitized hands and move on with life. Patel digs in a short-quick one, hurrying batsman into his pull for a top-edge that balloons and dips in front of mid-on. Fhawan's there, diving into it, and thigh-slapping. batsman c Dhawan b bowler 6(8)"
11109,"FOUR, genuinely squared up outside edge -- but batsman manages to keep some control and drop his wrists to guide it past the keeper"
11110,"out Caught by Harshal Patel!! Top-edged splice. 151ks, back of a length, outside off and batsman attempted carve over point ends up at third man, where Harshal does rather well to get low and under. batsman c Harshal Patel b bowler 5(4) [4s-1]"
11111,"SIX, brutal, murderous. And it's the first ball that he's faced -- swivelling, pulling, tonking flat over deep square leg"
11112,"FOUR, there's no long-off, and bowler dishes out a full toss, aka, juicy freebie, deservedly sliced over mid-off"
11113,"SIX, slogged, and bursting straight through a jumping Rahane at deep mid-wicket -- for batsman's 301st T20 six. Anyway, it's helped the equation come under three runs per ball"
11114,"1 run, 140kph, sharper bouncer, following the backing away for another adjusted hook to fine leg"
11115,"SIX, 116.1kph, bang in the slot, bang-er in the arc, and BANG. Tripathi's already one-kneed, smoking this over cow corner's roof"
11116,"SIX, slow full toss .. Tripathi's once again gone one-kneed and is slogging this flatter, cow corner"
11117,"FOUR, one-handed, outside-edge, and third man's inside the ring to be causing problems. bowler goes full and wide outside off, but Tripathi throws his bat out, ah, well .."
11118,"SIX, certified opener to certified finisher -- Rahul Tripathi's making the Cummins promotion look really silly. Another wide full toss and his one'kneed adventures get it sliced over extra cover"
11119,"SIX, 139kph, bouncer, nah, never mind. batsman stands with an opened up stance, whacks a pull, and gets it high, almighty outside the stadium, via fine leg"
11120,"SIX, more fun. MORE FUN. A 121kph slower cutter on a length. It's a sin, it's a cardinal sin. batsman stands like he does, crouched, under it, and slogs over deep square leg"
11121,"SIX, batsman's half a Yuvraj, 3/5th a Tewatia. Another full toss, and batsman - as if for fun - just swipes and smashes a hoarding on the square leg boundarys roof. Right, just to make sense: with an asking rate of 18-an-over, batsman's done it n half the time"
11122,"no run, Tripathi reviews a caught behind: It's a nasty bouncer, head-high, over the pull and with a clear sound as it goes through to the keeper. It's the sound of the ball brushing the helmet. Okay, Tripathi will survive .."
11123,"FOUR, another yorker goes wrong -- this one the other way in the form of a half volley that Tripathi hammers downtown, with mid-off in the circle. This is a joke, an unfunny joke"
11124,"1 run, back of a length, sensibly. Tripathi slaps, and finds sweeper"
11125,"out Caught by Hetmyer!! Brave delivery this -- back of a length, into the body and batsman in fact swipes it rather well. But no, it's flat and straight to a waiting backward square leg. The trick was that this one skidded along more than normal, getting batsman crouched more than normal. Okay, now, surely game over? No? Okay. batsman c Hetmyer b bowler 44(18) [4s-1 6s-5]"
11126,"FOUR, over point. Tripathi's one-kneed, staying under the low full toss and nailing it over. Now, now"
11127,"out Bowled!! Yorker. Timber. bowler finally gets it right, dipping under Tripathi's yet-another one-kneed-hoick and sneaking further to clean him up. batsman b bowler 36(16) [4s-3 6s-3]"
11128,"SIX, batsman greets bowler with a maximum! That's gone outta here. Flat, non-turner on a length, Rana gets down on one knee and nails the slog sweep to send it over deep square leg. New ball please!"
11129,"SIX, 15 runs off the over! In-drifter, but the length is tad too full. Ends up bowling it in the slot, Rana gets under it and swings his willow hard to dispatch it over long-on"
11130,"FOUR, 145kph, full and outside off, Gill lifts it over mid-off. Used the bowler's pace to his advantage. A couple of bounces and into the fence. Good start to the over for team"
11131,"SIX, that's a nice shot! Banged in short, head-high bumper at 140.4kph, Gill picks the length early, stands tall and pulls it away with aplomb over deep square leg for a 68m six!"
11132,"FOUR, authoritative shot! Short ball, not much venom, Gill stands tall and pulls it through backward square leg. The man in the deep didn't have much distance to cover, but the ball bulleted away"
11133,"FOUR, fuller ball outside off, Rana clears his front leg for a big hoick, gets a fat outside edge that goes fine of short third man and runs away to the third man fence"
11134,"FOUR, four more! 118.8kph, slow and full, Rana slightly looks to squeeze it out and gets another outside edge that beats a diving Pant to his left"
11135,"1 run, full on leg, flicked away to long leg"
11136,"no run, dropped! It was a return catch and bowler has spilt it. Flighted around off, Rana leans forward and closes the bat face to work it into the leg-side, the leading edge pops to the right of the bowler, bowler dives across and gets both hands, but the ball does not stick. He has also hurt his finger in the process.."
11137,"FOUR, 93.7kph, quick, short and wide. batsman takes heavy toll of it. Treks back in his crease and uses the bowler's pace and width to his advantage, Cut fiercely square of the wicket on the off-side"
11138,"out Caught by Pant!! Amit bowler breaks the 64-run stand. He conceded just 2 runs in his opening over, should have scalped Nitish Rana too. Nevertheless, he has nipped out Gill. A floaty leg-break, spins away a bit, Gill gets down to slog-sweep and only manages a top edge. Went a long way up in the air and Pant moves towards the square leg region to pouch it. batsman c Pant b bowler 28(22) [4s-2 6s-1]"
11139,"SIX, and, batsman takes full toll of the free-hit. bowler overpitches one, it's right in Rana's arc. The left-hander clears his front leg, bends his back leg and bludgeons it straight down the ground for a 81m six!"
11140,"FOUR, 125.1kph, bowler resorts to a slower ball from a shortened length. batsman clears his front leg and swings his bat hard to hammer it over vacant straight mid-on. One bounce and into the fence. The long-on fielder didn't even bother to move"
11141,"SIX, smacked! bowler misses his yorker by a couple of inches - ends up bowling a half-volley. batsman moves leg-side, clears his left leg and hoists it over the bowler's head. Bent his back leg and muscled it!"
11142,"out Caught by Nortje!! bowler has the last laugh! 144.6kph, dug in short, batsman wants to hit another six. Despite not being in a great position, hurriedly plays a pull shot and gets a big top edge. Nortje runs in from third man and holds onto it safely. bowler is cock-a-hoop! Big wicket for Delhi Capitals... batsman c Nortje b bowler 13(8) [4s-1 6s-1]"
11143,"SIX, there's the first six of the game. Didn't take long. You cannot bowl short to batsman not on this ground, not on any ground, easy pickings as he nonchalantly pulls it over deep mid-wicket"
11144,"out Caught by Bairstow!! Massive wicket for Hyderabad. Superb review from them. There was a sound but umpire Illingworth was not convinced. It was short and way outside off, close to being called a wide but batsman goes chasing after it and gets a toe-end, Bairstow does the rest behind the stumps. Replays also show a clear deviation in the path of the ball. batsman c Bairstow b bowler 6(5) [6s-1]"
11145,"SIX, lovely, excellent use of the feet from batsman, comes down the pitch, gets close to the ball and then launches it back over the bowler's head, brings up his first fifty of the season"
11146,"SIX, one over too many for KW - Warner had to complete the fourth over from his fifth bowler- but this is going the distance. Tad too full and well outside off, Kishan reaches out and slugs it high and wide of long-on for a maximum"
11147,"FOUR, cheeky and four, short of a length and angling across the left-hander, batsman moves right across, uses the pace on the ball and paddles it fine, past the keeper and runs away to the ropes"
11148,"SIX, nicely played, batsman is looking in top form now, length ball on off, he gets under this one and clubs the on-drive over mid-wicket - went flat and wide of Manish at long-on, over the ropes for a maximum"
11149,"out Caught&Bowled!! A miscue from batsman, Rashid called for the catch and Rashid takes the catch - running all the way to mid-wicket. The quicker delivery from the Afghan maestro - was the wrong 'un and batsman didn't spot it, was setting himself for the pull and ended up playing against the turn. A massive top-edge and the ball was in the air for a long time. Rashid was always under the delivery, watches it keenly and takes it over his shoulder. End of a fine knowck from the team opener. batsman c and b bowler 67(39) [4s-4 6s-4]"
11150,"SIX, Kishan is in some form - he will have to take over the role of the aggressor now, full and just outside off, he bends down low and pumps the slog-sweep over mid-wicket for a maximum"
11151,"SIX, fingertips and Warner has parried one over the ropes. Will it prove costly for team? Was a brilliant effort, he was on the move, leapt as high as he could, but managed to only parry it over the ropes - length ball outside off and Hardik pumped it high and over long-on"
11152,"FOUR, Manish hasn't had a great day in the field - fuller length delivery and well wide of off, Hardik sliced the drive wide of cover. Manish got across to his left at long-on and then went one-handed on the stop - can't stop it cleanly and the ball hit the ropes"
11153,"out Caught by Manish Pandey!! Now, now - this is simply sensational from Manish. He's had a shocker by his own high standards today, but he has pulled off an absolute ripper now. Kishan will consider himself desperately unlucky here, length ball and he flat-batted the lofted drive to the right of long-on. Had enough power, but not the elevation. Manish rushed across from long-on, threw himself at the ball - was parallel to the ground when he completed the two-handed catch and then had the sense to make sure that it didn't pop out when his elbow hit the ground. batsman c Manish Pandey b bowler 31(23) [4s-1 6s-2]"
11154,"SIX, clubbed, fraction too short from Natarajan, angling across the right-hander, Pandya stays back and pummels the pull over mid-wicket for a maximum"
11155,"SIX, even mishits can fly on this ground - Sandeep misses his yorker, offers a full-toss on the pads, batsman didn't get hold of the shovel, but the short boundaries takes care as the ball sails over the ropes. 100th six in Sharjah this IPL"
11156,"SIX, just over Rashid at backward square leg, low full-toss on the pads and batsman whipped it over backward square leg - Rashid got across and was trying to drag the ball back into play with his right hand, can't do so though"
11157,"no run, a loud shout for LBW and team will review. The angle means this ball must have pitched outside leg. Think so, can see all the three stumps, no bat for sure and UltraEdge confirms it. But it has pitched marginally outside leg and team lose their review. Good delivery to complete the spell, the slower dipping yorker from round the wicket, Hardik was looking to shovel it over the leg-side and is done by the late dip, struck low and in front of the leg-stump"
11158,"SIX, thumped, low full-toss wide of off, batsman reached out and got it pretty low off the bat - but the short boundaries meant that the fielder in the deep at long-off could only watch it sail over his head"
11159,"FOUR, nicely played, Natarajan missed his yorker by an inch, but that's enough for Hardik - opens the face of the bat and slices the drive over backward point for a boundary"
11160,"out Bowled!! The perfect yorker, this time by Siddarth and he has Hardik's stumps in a mess. Came from round the wicket - fired it very full and at the stumps, Hardik was opening himself on the helicopter shot, missed and the ball pinged the leg-stump, off his back-pad. If it hadn't hit the stumps, he would have been OUT plumb LBW. batsman b bowler 28(19) [4s-2 6s-2]"
11161,"SIX, smashed, change of pace and Krunal spotted it early, threw everything he had on the slog, gets enough to clear the fielder at long-on by a distance"
11162,"FOUR, Krunal is finishing in some style - low full-toss at the stumps, he gets under it and drilled it back past the bowler, the fielder at long-on has no chance"
11163,"FOUR, hat-trick of boundaries, low full-toss outside off, Krunal stayed deep inside the crease and scythed the drive wide of extra-cover. no wonder, he looks absolutely chuffed"
11164,"FOUR, poor start from Kaul. First ball and he sprays it down leg, batsman does not miss out, he clips it backward of square leg and the ball races across the turf"
11165,"FOUR, there is still a bit of movement. Outswinger outside off and Yadav plays it with the swing, lifts it over the infield on the off-side and almost collects half a dozen, just bounced inside"
11166,"FOUR, fabulous shot! Kaul is going for plenty here. Should Warner have persisted with Sandeep? This was a back of a length delivery, Yadav stands tall and punches it elegantly through extra cover"
11167,"FOUR, fourth boundary of the over. Kaul is all over the place. He overcorrects the length and offers a half volley, Yadav drives it straight of mid-on and the timing takes care of the rest"
11168,"SIX, a four-ball unbeaten 20 for Krunal and he has lifted team to 208, length ball at the stumps - Krunal gets under it and sends it high and over long-on. Warner can only watch it sail into the stands. Krunal is absolutely thrilled as he walks back"
11169,"FOUR, Yadav is dealing in boundaries at the moment. All his runs have come in fours. Swinging down leg, Yadav flicks it backward of square and beats the fielder in the deep comfortably"
11170,"FOUR, no timing on that but it still beats the fielder to the fence. Full delivery and batsman tries to force it straight down the ground, gets it off the inner half and the ball races past mid-on"
11171,"FOUR, Kaul is having a horror time. This is the fifth boundary he has conceded in seven balls. A full toss just below the waist, Yadav helps it along the way past short fine"
11172,"FOUR, make that six fours in ten balls. He is just feeding it right in the slot. Overpitched delivery outside off, Yadav decides to go up and over, lofts it over extra cover with the full face of the bat"
11173,"out Caught by T Natarajan!! Horrible cricket from both Kaul and Yadav. This was another rubbish delivery from Kaul. Full and spraying down leg, like Rohit, Yadav goes chasing it and flicks it straight to Natarajan at short fine leg. He could have let it through and collected a wide, he could have hit it along the ground but instead Yadav picked out the fielder. batsman c T Natarajan b bowler 27(18) [4s-6]"
11174,"2 runs, flighted on the stumps, batsman works it square on the leg-side and scampers back for the second"
11175,"SIX, oh no! Pandey has parried it over the rope. Is this the luck batsman needed to get going? This was not all that short and hence batsman could not get the elevation on the pull, hit it flat towards long-on where Pandey moves to his left and allows the ball to burst through his fingers. Tough chance but you expect it to be taken"
11176,"FOUR, ""catch it"" shouted Bairstow but it was nowhere close to the fielder. The wrong 'un is leg-lined, Kishan goes down on his knee and nails the sweep over the square leg umpire, no chance for the long leg"
11177,"SIX, this was right in the slot and batsman ensures it is dispatched. Flighted outside off, batsman had the width to free his arms and he smacks it straight down the ground, clearing the sightscreen comfortably"
11178,"FOUR, batsman is finally getting into his groove. This was fraction short and he was quick to pick the length, rocks back and pulls it in front of square - bisecting long-on and deep mid-wicket"
11179,"SIX, what a way to get off the mark! Wide half-volley and at Sharjah of all places, that's gotta go. batsman reaches out and lofts it cleanly over long-off. It's gone for a mammoth six"
11180,"FOUR, absolutely smashed! batsman premeditates the length and charges down the track, holds his shape and nails the pull over mid-wicket. Total nonchalance"
11181,"FOUR, bowler is losing his radar a bit here and probably, confused with his lengths too. Goes very full but it's on the pads, batsman gets a tickle on it. More of the inside half and it beats de Kock down the leg-side"
11182,"SIX, round-arm ball from round the wicket, a length ball outside off at 93.5kph, batsman swings his bat hard and deposits it over long-on. Got it off the bottom of bat, but all those won't matter at this ground"
11183,"FOUR, Pandya goes for the yorker, misses his length by an inch or two and batsman takes heavy toll of it. The skipper gets under it and lofts it over the bowler's head for a one-bounce four"
11184,"1 run, 146.2kph, bowler tries to bowl a yorker and ends up bowling a low full toss. batsman push-drives down the pitch and the mid-off fielder dives to his left to stop it. The single also brings up batsman's fifty! Can he take his team over the winning line. Just 6 runs came off the over - team were happy to take the singles against bowler"
11185,"out Caught by de Kock!! bowler has deceived the NZ captain with a slower delivery. Off-speed, on a shortish length and just outside off. batsman arched his back to play a late-upper-cut. He was through with his shot and only managed a faint outside nick. Simple catch for the 'keeper. batsman tried to pull his bat in, but it was too late. batsman c de Kock b bowler 3(5)"
11186,"FOUR, 110.8kph, slow, short and wide. batsman backs away and slaps it fiercely over extra cover. Couple of bounces and into the fence. Still a good over for Mumbai as they managed to nip out KW"
11187,"1 run, just 7 runs off the over. Overpitched delivery at 121.5kph, Garg gets under it and absolutely smashes it. bowler is brave to stick his right hand out - over his head - and parry it towards the mid-wicket region. Too harsh to call it a drop..."
11188,"out Caught by Rahul Chahar!! Full toss and out! Garg shapes up to slog-sweep, gets the timing wrong - courtesy top edge - and Chahar has pulled off a brilliant catch at deep square leg. The leggie moved to his left, and reverse-cupped it. He was very close to the boundary rope and tumbled to complete the catch. Did he touch the boundary rope while tumbling and getting up? The TV umpire has been summoned and he rules it rightly in the favour of the fielding team. batsman c Rahul Chahar b bowler 8(7)"
11189,"out Caught by Ishan Kishan!! bowler has his man! It's the slower ball off the back of the hand, wide outside off at 110.8kph, batsman chases it for a cut and gets a thick top edge. Kishan dives to his right at short third man and completes the formalities. The fielder is pumped up, I'm sure the entire team set-up is. batsman c Ishan Kishan b bowler 60(44) [4s-5 6s-2]"
11190,"SIX, this lad is known to hit massive sixes. 143.2kph, bowler misses the yorker, Samad stays deep in his crease, gets under it and bludgeons it over the bowler's head. The sightscreen has to bear the brunt.."
11191,"FOUR, four to end the over! 142.7kph, very full and wide of off, Samad shuffles across and superbly slices it over backward point. Pattinson runs to his right in the deep, but puts in a lousy effort to stop that. bowler wears a cheeky smile on his face, sure he didn't like it"
11192,"SIX, 128.8kph, slower ball on a shortish length, sits up nicely. Samad walks across, waits for the ball and pummels it over deep backward square leg with a pull shot"
11193,"out Caught by Rohit!! 146.8kph, bowler goes full, the line is around off, Samad wants to slog across the line. The ball pops up off the leading edge and Rohit completes the formalities in the extra cover region. batsman c Rohit b bowler 20(9) [4s-1 6s-2]"
11194,"out Bowled!! The middle-stump has been uprooted! Goes for the yorker, bowls a low full toss at 141.4kph, batsman moves across to scoop and doesn't connect. Hears the death rattle! batsman b bowler 10(13)"
11195,"SIX, the first bad ball of the over and batsman says 'Thank you very much!'! Dropped short by Krunal and it's launched over deep mid-wicket. Easy peasy for JB"
11196,"out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! Superb bowling! Slower bouncer from bowler, kept it wide outside off and that meant batsman had to really fetch it on the pull. He is clearly foxed by the variation, and one hand coming off during the shot execution doesn't help either. Straight down the throat of deep square leg. Brilliant cricket from team. batsman c Hardik Pandya b bowler 25(15) [4s-2 6s-2]"
11197,"FOUR, he's getting into the act straightaway. Perhaps a slower ball again from bowler, this is fuller though and Pandey waits for it, before dispatching it straight down the ground"
11198,"FOUR, probably another slower ball but this is a fraction short and sits up for Pandey who pulls this over mid-wicket. Picks his spot and gets a boundary"
11199,"FOUR, first time that batsman has tried to time the ball and he gets rewarded instantly. Short and angling across him, he just uses bowler's pace to steer it between short third man and backward point"
11200,"FOUR, and again! Much better from batsman, not so from bowler. Short again and allows the left-hander to free his arms. Punches this on the up and splits the gap at cover. This should get the team skipper going"
11201,"FOUR, how about that for timing? Geez! A fairly good delivery from bowler, angles this on a good length and Pandey just pushes it with a straight bat past the bowler. Just a gentle-looking push but it speeds across the turf to the fence in no time. Wow!! Shot of the day?"
11202,"FOUR, Hardik puts down a dolly! The catching in this IPL hasn't been good at all. This is another instance of a superb fielder spilling an easy chance. Was short and wide, bowled cleverly by bowler and Pandey tried to upper-cut it. Doesn't get the distance and Hardik at sweeper overruns the ball. What's worse, it's gone to the fence. He has his sunglasses on so no excuse of the sun in the eyes either"
11203,"SIX, didn't I tell ya? Pandey loves to murder spin, especially when it's tossed up fuller and at this ground, hitting that for six is just a formality. Clobbered over cow corner. Easy as you like"
11204,"SIX, that's on the roof! Chahar isn't learning, errs on the fuller side again and it's slower too. batsman mows it over long-on for a huge hit. team sensing that this is the time to go big"
11205,"2 runs, superb batting! Slower on leg stump, it's the googly and batsman called for two as soon as he wristed this through mid-wicket. Gets the right response from Manish Pandey"
11206,"FOUR, this is excellent batting! Not that bad a ball from bowler, on a good length around off stump but batsman backs away early to make room. And then uses the pace to steer it between short third man and backward point"
11207,"out Caught by Pollard!! There's the wicket team were looking for! Precisely why Rohit brought bowler on, and the plan has worked. Fuller and wider outside off, might have been a tad slower than bowler's usual deliveries and Pandey doesn't get the timing on the loft. Picks out Polly at long-off and he ain't dropping these, not even with this 'catching flu' that's caught the IPL. An enterprising little knock from Pandey ends but he'll be gutted to go at this point. batsman c Pollard b bowler 30(19) [4s-4 6s-1]"
11208,"FOUR, 134.2kph, strays on the hips. Okay, this should help batsman, it better help batsman, with free runs off a fine leg-glance"
11209,"FOUR, that's more Watto-like. A big forward plonk, leaning under the length and lofting this punch over mid-on"
11210,"FOUR, strays on the hip and batsman picks it away wide of short fine leg. bowler isn't very pleased by the effort. Basically there was no effort"
11211,"FOUR, oh that's vintage batsman. Reaches fifty by planting his foot down to a length ball and crashing it through extra cover. Comforting sight for the dugout"
11212,"1 run, Faf follows Watson in raising his fifty. Opens the face as he pushes a full ball to third man. Continues his good form in this tournament"
11213,"FOUR, overpitches outside off, batsman muscles the drive wide of long-off. Doing it in a canter"
11214,"SIX, batsman's found his range tonight. Clears the front leg to a length ball and clubs it down the ground. Clean hitting"
11215,"FOUR, Punjab aren't going to turn this around with these deliveries. Short at the stumps, Faf crunches the pull between long-on and midwicket"
11216,"SIX, Harpreet is almost forced to bowl it closer after the call, gets into batsman's arc and gets nailed over long-on"
11217,"1 run, hammered to long-on. 150 stand up. It's as if their earlier troubles didn't even exist"
11218,"FOUR, spoils a good over by pitching it too full. It's a blistering drive through extra cover from batsman"
11219,"FOUR, full toss outside off, Faf flays it over point. Now the highest partnership for team in IPL"
11220,"FOUR, yorker outside off, runs away fine past short third man. Faf reached out to it and got it right off the toe-end. What a miserable return for bowler this is turning to be"
11221,"SIX, what a ridiculous shot. Slices it one-handed over cover for six. Was a near yorker from bowler and gets creamed by batsman"
11222,"FOUR, low full toss outside off, driven through extra cover. The sweeper gives up. It's a 10-wicket hammering"
11223,"FOUR, it's in the slot, it's in batsman's arc, and he makes sure he plonks in front and smokes this downtown, and makes sure he makes it look seriously brutal"
11224,"FOUR, overpitches. There's no one straight down in the deep, and batsman easily gets under this one to go over, typically"
11225,"FOUR, there's an entirely empty deep mid-wicket, so Faf walks across his stumps and tucks this uppishly with a lot of bottom hand into that area. Just timing, checked timing"
11226,"FOUR, neatly ramped. A cutter from bowler, which Faf's spotted early, shuffling big time and sitting under to scoop it over the keeper"
11227,"FOUR, again, not off the middle, but he's managed enough chunk on this inside-halved-pull between mid-wicket and mid-on"
11228,"FOUR, overcompensates with width this time. Now, now. Faf slices, over and wide of short third man with nobody behind"
11229,"FOUR .. and team have officially arrived. 19 off this over, with a forehand smash down the ground. He made room, made sure he was on top of the the in-angling short one and muscled it wide of mid-on. It's bowler's birthday, and this is the equivalent of birthday bumps .."
11230,"FOUR, punishes the short ball and pulls hard through square leg. Motoring along is batsman"
11231,"FOUR, batsman steps across and paddle-scoops this off the stumps. Long chase for Cottrell running across from long leg. Puts in a big dive but to no avail"
11232,"FOUR, this won't help. This won't help Punjab at all. Swept straight to Shami at short fine leg, but he doesn't even get a hand on it. Right through the legs."
11233,"FOUR, advances down, gets beside the ball, lofts it over extra cover. Lovely batting"
11234,"FOUR, almost got himself in trouble looking to pull a ball that wasn't very short. It skids through off a length, headed towards middle and leg. But batsman manages to get it off a thick under-edge, which then beats Shami at short fine"
11235,"SIX, batsman has destroyed this googly. He has absolutely destroyed it. Slog-swept into the top tier. That's soul-crushing"
11236,"1 run, right in the blockhole, Faf squeezes it wide of square leg. A 100-run opening stand for team. What bliss for their teammates who stand up to applaud"
11237,"FOUR, there's a sweeper cover in place, but he can't do nothing about it. Full and wide outside off and batsman creams it past the fielder with impeccable timing and incredible placement"
11238,"SIX, shot! batsman goes down on his knee and smokes the tossed up delivery over deep mid-wicket with a meaty slog. Such. Sweet. Timing! Maxwell does some bhangra in the dug-out to acknowledge the batsman"
11239,"SIX, batsman is dealing in sixes! A short ball by bowler, batsman rocks back in the crease and pulls it over deep mid-wicket for six more. Just the momentum they were looking for!"
11240,out Caught by Rayudu!! A fine low catch by Rayudu brings an end to batsman's cameo. Slightly up outside off and batsman plays an uppish drive straight to the man stationed at cover. Looks skyward does the batsman as he's disappointed at his dismissal. Was looking for a boundary and has perished in the process. batsman c Rayudu b bowler 27(16) [6s-2]
11241,"FOUR, an edge and that has fetched him a boundary. Was a slower delivery outside off and batsman got an outside edge on his drive. The fielder at third man tried his best to stop it with a dive, but he couldn't really do it"
11242,"1 run, opens the bat face and glides it down to third man for one"
11243,"FOUR, slams over extra cover. Shuffles across early, which bowler sees and goes wider .. and gets carved over"
11244,"SIX, another shuffle, and bowler fires it in quicker and into the body. batsman pulls, no, wait, tonks, over an empty backward square leg"
11245,"SIX, finally. FINALLY. batsman goes uppish, shows intent, getting under Thakur's juicy length delivery to smoke it over long-off. Also, a fifty, and no one's keeping count anymore, there's no point"
11246,"FOUR, the tap's opened. Thakur tries going wider and fuller, but batsman still finds a way to get under it and slice over extra cover"
11247,"FOUR, delicate now -- lining up, opening his bat face and bisecting backward point and short third man. yep, he's officially found his gear box"
11248,"SIX, 134.3kph, absolutely holds onto this heave. He's already standing with an open stance, swinging across the line, and then boom. Onto cow corner's second tier"
11249,"SIX, high full toss, and whacked with disdain. batsman doesn't even bother looking up after flat-batting this into cow corner"
11250,"2 runs, chopped away, under-half, and an easy second before the man in the deep can clean up"
11251,"out Caught by Jadeja!! Cross-seamed one in the slot, which batsman's shaping up to smoke somewhere into the desert outside deep mid-wicket. But, but, there's something called not finding the middle, and as shocking as it might sound in this innings for batsman, this delivery was that. He gets a lot of height, but Jadeja's swirling under at the boundary, reverse-cupping a seriously good catch. batsman c Jadeja b bowler 33(17) [4s-1 6s-3]"
11252,"out Caught by Dhoni!! W.W. And just like that, both set batsmen who'd laid this platform for the final assault, won't be the ones doing it, if it ever goes on to happen. A full wide delivery that batsman throws his bat out to, but doesn't get close to the line, ending up outside-edging the squeeze to a diving MSD -- who has his 100th IPL catch. Wow, quite the equivalent of 400 Test wickets. batsman c Dhoni b bowler 63(52) [4s-7 6s-1]"
11253,"FOUR, okay, it's tennis now. batsman's already standing in a very-open stance, swatting this short-wide delivery like a forehand smash over mid-off"
11254,"FOUR, remember 2015? Yea, it's that Sarfaraz -- sitting down, staying under the low full-paced full toss to discoop it over the keeper"
11255,"FOUR, wide yorker, and really nothing wrong with this. There was a deep third man and a backward point as well. But still, Sarfaraz's found a way to angle his bat out and squeeze it extremely fine"
11256,"FOUR, lovely cut! Back of a length outside off, width on offer and batsman plays a fine square cut as the ball races away through the backward point region for four runs"
11257,"FOUR, batsman is riding his luck. Slightly up outside off, this one seams away from the batsman who flays at it and gets an outside edge that flies over short third man. Fleming's reaction in the balcony depicts how desperate team are for a win.."
11258,"FOUR, just the kind of over Punjab needed to get going. 12 runs off it as batsman square drives the slightly full ball through point and manages to beat the sprinter in the deep. batsman knocked over Curran at the other end as his eyes were on the ball. The little guy is on the floor.."
11259,"FOUR, smashed! Full length delivery outside off and Mayank absoutely belts it over covers as he finds the boundary once again. Went flat and almost cleared the boundary on the full"
11260,"FOUR, batsman welcomes Thakur with a boundary. A front foot pull shot by batsman as the bowler goes slightly short. That's the kind of form these openers are in"
11261,"1 run, 50-run stand up between the openers as batsman glides the short of a length delivery down to third man"
11262,"FOUR, short and punished! Width on offer outside off, batsman opens the bat face and cuts it past the diving fielder at point. Can see a few Punjab flags in the stands"
11263,out Caught by Sam Curran!! bowler get batsman! The leg spinner strikes on his first ball. Was a short ball by Piyush as batsman pulled it straight to Sam Curran at deep mid-wicket. Looked a tired shot and the batsman will have to make his walk back to the pavilion. That's also a time-out.. batsman c Sam Curran b bowler 26(19) [4s-3]
11264,"FOUR, 123.7kph, harmless short of length ball. Shaw doesn't need second invitations to put it away. The right-hander stands tall, fetches it from outside off and pulls it fiercely in front of square on the leg-side. Off the mark with a boundary"
11265,"FOUR, slower ball, full on leg and middle, Shaw picks it and brings his wrists into play. Flicked away through the gap between mid-wicket and mid-on. Second boundary of the over"
11266,"FOUR, make that three! Poor stuff from bowler. He shortens his length and strays it on leg, wristily tucked away through backward square leg. 14 runs off the over"
11267,"out Caught by Devdutt Padikkal!! Fantastic catch by Padikkal. Huge wicket for team as it is the in-form Delhi skipper walking back. He does fancy clearing the rope against the spinners and would have as well if he was playing in Sharjah or Abu Dhabi, but not here. Flighted around off, Iyer goes with the spin and heaves it to deep mid-wicket, Padikkal settles under it and clutches with both hands, then throws the ball up, goes outside the boundary rope and comes back in to complete the catch. Excellent awareness shown by the youngster. batsman c Devdutt Padikkal b bowler 11(13) [4s-1]"
11268,"FOUR, batsman will take on bowler even with the long boundaries. Flighted outside off, batsman is down on his knee and launches the slog sweep over mid-wicket, since it is a big side of the ground, the ball bounces inside the rope"
11269,"1 run, once more keeps it on middle and leg, batsman nudges it square on the leg-side"
11270,"SIX, batsman does clear the boundary rope at deep mid-wicket. This a half tracker and those bulging forearms come into play, he muscles it way over the fence"
11271,"FOUR, the extra deliveries cost him a boundary. 15 off the over and a much needed one for Delhi. This was also quicker but right in the slot, batsman smacks it straight down the ground for a one bounce four"
11272,"SIX, woah! That's some shot from batsman. Back of a length delivery and he was so quick to pick that, transferred his weight back and bullied it for a flat six over cow corner"
11273,"FOUR, batsman is on fire here. Remember he is playing against his old franchise. Length delivery and batsman swings through the line, not off the middle but goes straight and collects a one bounce four"
11274,"FOUR, just over the fielder. Saini proving to be expensive today, already gone for 29 in 11 balls. He goes for the wide yorker, batsman lines up by going down on his knee, slices it over backward point and just over the fielder"
11275,"1 run, dropped! How costly a miss is this going to be? They dropped Rahul around the same time and we know what happened after. This was a full toss and batsman does not get it off the middle, heaves it towards deep mid-wicket where Chahal moves to his left and lets it slip through his hands. Moeen too was running across from long-on. Did that put him off?"
11276,"FOUR, dipping full delivery around off, batsman moves across, waits for the ball to arrive and then drills it hard past extra cover. No chance for the sweeper to get across and stop it"
11277,"1 run, back of a length around off, batsman miscues the heave and the ball bounces just in front of long-on. The 50-run stand comes up between the duo and it has come in quick time"
11278,"FOUR, batsman is picking his gaps for fun here. The full delivery isn't working for him, stays deep in the crease and manages to whip it away to deep mid-wicket, Padikkal has no chance this time"
11279,"1 run, run out chance missed. team making the same mistakes they made in their loss against team. Low full toss outside off, batsman moves across and flicks it to the right of deep mid-wicket, he wanted the second and was halfway down, even given up since Pant didn't want it. But Kohli does not gather Padikkal's throw and that allows batsman to make his ground back"
11280,"SIX, batsman gets into the act now. Saini is being taken to the cleaners. Slower delivery and batsman spotted it early, lined himself for the big hit and smacked it straight back over the bowler, just clearing the rope"
11281,"FOUR, superb, sensible batting. Saini is all over the shop. Slower delivery down leg, batsman moves inside the line and helps it along the way past short fine, no chance for Finch or the fielder getting across from deep square leg"
11282,"FOUR, miscued but it was in the gap. Slower delivery outside off, batsman is through the shot a bit early and ends up slicing it over extra cover, the ball has enough to beat a chasing Finch from long-off"
11283,"no ball, SIX, oh my! Now bowler does a Saini. High full toss that almost took out batsman's head, the keeper-batsman does well to duck and swing across the line, the top-edge sails over the fine leg fence"
11284,"out Bowled!! Cleaned up! bowler has his man. The partnership has been broken but the damage has been done. The slower delivery from bowler, rolled his fingers across the ball at the last second, batsman goes on his knee to play the slog sweep but is through the shot early, the ball clips the inside edge brushes his thigh and ends up on the stumps. batsman b bowler 37(25) [4s-3 6s-2]"
11285,"FOUR, fifty for batsman. That's his second of the season and it has been a brutal innings. Apart from the first ball, it was a decent over from bowler. He went full and wide outside off, batsman moves across and whips it in front of square. The shot was on as fine leg and square leg were inside the ring. He raises his bat and soaks in the applause of his team mates"
11286,"SIX, bowler misses the yorker but batsman doesn't miss. It was a full toss and batsman uses his power to muscle it over deep mid-wicket, cleared the fence quite comfortably there"
11287,"FOUR, a gift first up from Saini and batsman gleefully accepts it. A wide, half-volley outside off at 139.9kph, batsman throws his arms and flays the drive through the covers. Sped away to the fence"
11288,"SIX, that's an incredible shot from batsman! Fullish ball outside off at 143.6kph, Shaw bends his back leg and lofts it handsomely over extra cover. Came off the meat of the bat and went all the way. Mind you, it was the longer side too"
11289,"FOUR, that's a freebie from bowler. A flat leggie at 89.4kph, on the shorter side too. Shaw clears his front leg and slaps it through the covers. Authoritative shot"
11290,"SIX, now a biggie! bowler is brave to toss this one up, bowls it full and outside off. Shaw gets down on one leg and bludgeons it over wide long-on for a mighty six. New ball, please!"
11291,"FOUR, Delhi have decided to go after team's best bowler. Leg-stump line, batsman crouches and slog-sweeps it over backward square leg for a one-bounce four"
11292,"FOUR, bowler concedes his first boundary of the match. Shaw shuffles and gets low to slog-sweep. Gets a top edge against this leg-stump line ball. Flies over the keeper and runs away very fine to the fence"
11293,"FOUR, that's a hit-me delivery. bowler shortens his length and there's not much pace or bounce to threaten the batter. batsman gets into a strong position and pummels the pull in front of square on the leg-side"
11294,"out Caught by de Villiers!! team have the breakthrough and Kohli is pumped up. Shaw has been bounced out. A head-high bumper on leg from bowler, gets a bit big on Shaw who got inside the line to hook it away. The ball trims the glove on its way to the keeper. AB moves to his left to pouch it. End of an entertaining knock from Shaw. batsman c de Villiers b bowler 42(23) [4s-5 6s-2]"
11295,"FOUR, bowler welcomes Iyer with a gift by doling out a leg-stump half-volley at 140kph. The skipper, who is in great form, gets off the mark with an easy flick off his pads through backward square leg"
11296,"out Caught by Moeen Ali!! Holed out! 134.4kph, full on the stumps, batsman stands outside leg-stump and backs himself to clear the ropes. The bat turns at the point of impact and robs all the timing. It comes off the bottom part of the bat too. Moeen takes a couple of steps forward from long-on to complete the catch. batsman c Moeen Ali b bowler 32(28) [4s-3]"
11297,"no run, bowler drops it! Such an easy caught and bowled chance, but KG has put it down. batsman had chipped it right back to the bowler who got his palms to it, but nothing more. Maybe, he got deceived due to the trajectory as the ball was dipping on him"
11298,"FOUR, cracking shot by batsman to greet bowler. Short of a length outside off, batsman reaches out for it and slams it through the gap at cover-point for a boundary"
11299,"2 runs, dropped again! What's going on? batsman gets an another life as Dhawan fails to latch onto this one at slip as he tries to reverse cup it. Went at the full ball with hard hands and got an outside edge that absolutely flew to the man in the cordon. Looks like it's his day"
11300,"out Caught by Hetmyer !! It's the longest part of the boundary at cow corner, but Moeen thinks his forward-charging-hoick would do it. Nope, much like his innings, and much like team, this goes nowhere .. and that nowhere is straight down deep mid-wicket's throat. batsman c Hetmyer b bowler 11(13) [4s-1]"
11301,"SIX, steps down, makes room for himself, gets it perfectly in the slot, and tonks this into long-on's first floor"
11302,"FOUR, 123.8kph, just a punch. First ball, eh. High elbows, standing up on the length delivery and stroking away through the line, through the covers"
11303,"out Caught by Pant!! So bowler's now got batsman thrice in seven innings -- Bunny worthy? Anyway, batsman didn't have much of a choice here. He'd realized he's got to everything left by himself, and so what if it's the Delhi's best bowler, He charges down, swipes across the line and ends up getting a thin inside-tickle through to the keeper. batsman c Pant b bowler 43(39) [4s-2 6s-1]"
11304,"SIX, gets hold of this .. under the length to a fuller-than-usual delivery to smoke it over long-on against the spin"
11305,"FOUR, 142kph, short, wide and Sundar uses all of it in a jumpy upper-cut, behind point, in front of third man"
11306,"FOUR, 141.8kph, pitches it up in the slot .. and Sundar drills it straight down, lofting it over bowler's head"
11307,"out Caught by Ashwin!! 141kph. Short. Head-lined. Sundar looks to make room. Pulls. Zero timing. Negative control. Mid-wicket inside the circle. And just like these broken sentences, team crumble further. batsman c Ashwin b bowler 17(11) [4s-3]"
11308,"out Bowled!! 143kph bolt -- full, into middle-stump, and Dube's aimless swing isn't even close to connecting. Yea, sheer pace, and sheer-er accuracy, going under the bat and making a real mess of the stumps. batsman b bowler 11(12) [6s-1]"
11309,"out Caught by Shreyas Iyer!! WW.W. bowler's putting up a spectacle here, courtesy batsman's top-edged slice, barely clearing the infield as Iyer - the extra cover - runs backwards and takes it without fuss. batsman c Shreyas Iyer b bowler 1(3)"
11310,"FOUR, very low full toss, marginally outside off. But batsman after backing away manages to stick his bat out and somehow connect to get it really fine past backward point"
11311,"out Bowled!! Typically tail-ender like. batsman clearly (and smartly) keeps backing away to save getting hit and this time bowler's not taking chances. He's kept it really full, on middle, and is uprooting middle. batsman b bowler 5(4) [4s-1]"
11312,"FOUR, boom. With 24 runs needed per ball, Saini's managed one-sixth, but it's a night time one-sixth. Backing away, getting under Patel's full one and swinging downtown"
11313,"out Caught by Stoinis!! Ravichandran bowler gets the man in form. An off-break by bowler, that was bowled a lot slower through the air. batsman swings his bat and gets it off the cue end as Stoinis takes a comfortable catch at deep mid-wicket. The pressure of big scores, he's yet to deal with that, is batsman. Even against Punjab when team were set a big target, Padikkal failed to get going. Same is the case today. batsman c Stoinis b bowler 4(6)"
11314,"FOUR, he announced his return to form in the previous game, and here's another superb shot. Gets off the mark on the first ball of the innings as he creams the floated delivery through covers with sublime timing"
11315,"out Caught by Pant!! batsman has been dismissed, finally. So, the couple of dropped chances haven't cost much. This pitched outside off and spun away sharply from the batsman who tried to flirt with it and got an outside edge. Sharp reflexes by Pant as he takes it. Both team openers are back to the pavilion as the Delhi spinners are choking their opposition at the moment. batsman c Pant b bowler 13(14) [4s-1]"
11316,"FOUR, easy pickings for batsman! This was speared down the leg side by bowler and the skipper flicks it past the man at short fine leg with nonchalance. 9000 runs in T20 cricket for batsman, informs Sunny G on air.."
11317,"FOUR, that was in the air for a while, but just eluded the man at mid-off. This delivery was pitched up by bowler and AB played a gentle chip. Almost got deceived due to the slower one, but luckily he played it with a straight bat to get it past the fielder stationed at mid-off"
11318,"no run, a direct-hit at the bowler's end and Kohli was gone! This was driven to Ashwin at mid-on by batsman and Kohli was almost halfway down the track. Ash had plenty of time to aim and go for the direct-hit at the bowler's end, but he couldn't pull it off"
11319,"FOUR, short in length around off, batsman treks back in his crease and slams it over extra cover for a boundary"
11320,"out Caught by Dhawan!! Royal Challengers Bangalore in trouble as AB batsman walks back. Was a length ball by bowler and the batsman completely miscued it. Tried to hoick across the line and mistimed it towards mid-wicket where Dhawan takes a comfortable catch. In the battle of two South Africans, it's the younger bloke who comes out on top. batsman c Dhawan b bowler 9(6) [4s-2]"
11321,"FOUR, swept away! Down on his knee as he sweeps the loopy delivery past the man at deep square leg for four runs"
11322,"1 run, darts this one outside off and batsman punches it through covers for a single"
11323,"FOUR, lovely, a friendly half-volley outside off and batsman is off and running with a boundary, leans into the drive and places it straight of mid-off, the fielder didn't have a chance"
11324,"FOUR, lovely, poor line and length from bowler, can't offer width with third man inside the ring - batsman waits on the ball, opens the face of the bat at the last moment and guides it behind square on the off-side for a boundary"
11325,"FOUR, fabulous shot! It was the wrong 'un and Suryakumar picked it, he went down on his knee and swept it with the spin backward of square, giving no chance for the fielder in the deep"
11326,"FOUR, that's another excellent shot. A inside out loft off the backfoot. This was fraction short and Suryakumar forced it over the cover fielder, he had enough power to beat the sweeper"
11327,"SIX, pressure releaser for Krunal. He was not getting anything off the middle till now. Tewatia floats one up and Krunal takes it on, slog sweeps straight down the ground and collects half a dozen"
11328,"out Caught by Shreyas Gopal!! Of course he can. That's Archer at his best. Exploits the weakness of Krunal and sends him packing. Short of length delivery at the ribs, Krunal is not comfortable anything around there, he gets all cramped up as he attempts the pull, it is a tame one and Gopal gobbles up the dolly at mid-wicket. batsman c Shreyas Gopal b bowler 12(17) [6s-1]"
11329,"FOUR, neatly done! Fifty for Suryakumar. First of the season for him. He has looked good in the last few games but has been run-out in a couple of them. Today he has not thrown it away. Coming to the ball: Slower delivery and Suryakumar waited for it, steered it so well that he bisected Buttler and short third man"
11330,"FOUR, stand and deliver! Mid-off was inside the ring. Archer offers width on the back of a length and Hardik flat-bats it straight past the fielder at mid-off"
11331,"FOUR, good improvisation there from Suryakumar. Mumbai needed a boundary to make it a good over. He moves inside the line, gets under the back of a length delivery and helps it over short fine"
11332,"FOUR, full toss outside off and though Hardik didn't get it off the middle, he gets it into the gap - sliced over extra cover and Gopal cannot chase it down. He immediately asks for a drier pair of gloves.."
11333,"2 runs, 137.5kph right in the blockhole, Hardik jams it with a closed bat face into the mid-wicket region, the fielders are on the boundary edge allowing the second to be taken"
11334,"1 run, dropped! How costly will that be? Curran has no one else to blame than himself. The slower short ball outside off, Hardik tries to flat-bat it down town but the top-edge flies straight up to the right of the bowler, Curran sets himself up and lets it slip through his hands. He took his eyes off just at the right time"
11335,"SIX, superb batting. Suryakumar shuffles across, goes down on his knee and waits for the low full toss, then nonchalantly helps it over backward square. The connection was so good that the ball sailed over"
11336,"FOUR, 19 off the over.. That's the big one Mumbai wanted. Curran goes for the slower back of a length stuff, Suryakumar walks across, gets inside the line and laps it over short fine leg"
11337,"2 runs, free-hit and Hardik cannot take toll of it. Low full toss on middle and leg, Hardik drills it down to long-on and Suryakumar races back for the second. He was helped by a slight fumble"
11338,"no ball, byes, FOUR, oh my! That must have slipped out of Archer's hand. High full toss right at Hardik's head, he does well to duck under it. The ball bounces just in front of Buttler and escapes past him. Archer immediately had his hands up apologetically"
11339,"SIX, wow! That's special. We have seen this before but to do it to Archer after being hit on the head. Hats off! Full delivery just short of yorker length, Suryakumar crouches down and reverse laps it straight over Buttler, the pace of Archer ensures it goes the distance. Even Smith was impressed with that shot"
11340,"FOUR, that's brilliant cricket. Suryakumar moved across early and bowler followed him with a full toss, but the batsman adjusted and scooped it over short fine, one bounce and over the ropes"
11341,"SIX, once more not off the meat but the power of Hardik ensures it goes sailing over the rope. It was a freebie from bowler, juicy full toss and Hardik goes straight, clearing the boundary quite comfortably"
11342,"SIX, beautifully played, tad too full and wide from bowler, batsman leans forward, gets close to the ball, extends his arms and launches it over mid-off went sailing over the ropes for a maximum"
11343,"FOUR, cracking shot, bowler is proving to be expensive - back of a length and wide of off, batsman waits on it and then cuts it late, beats the sliding effort of the fielder running across to his left from deep point"
11344,"FOUR, cheeky and four, change of pace from bowler, the slower ball angling across the left-hander, batsman shuffles across, gets inside the line and helps it on its way over short fine for another boundary"
11345,"FOUR, a big effort from Rajpoot at fine leg, but that would have been the catch of the season had he held it - length ball down leg and batsman whipped it violently towards fine leg - The ball was travelling and Ankit ran across to his left - put in the dive, but the ball was always going away from him"
11346,"SIX, massive, fraction short and batsman is quick on the pull - rocks back and pulls it high and over backward square leg, went sailing over the ropes"
11347,"SIX, a high full-toss and batsman has sent is sailing into the stands - prods across and then brings his wrists into play, came at an uncomfortable height, but he was equal to the task, pulled over backward square leg for a maximum"
11348,"out Caught by Buttler!! Maiden IPL wicket for Kartik - beaten for sheer pace was batsman - banged in short and at the stumps, batsman was rocking back on the pull, the ball kept getting big on him, he was in no control over the shot, gets a top-edge that spills straight up - Buttler called for the catch and holds on with ease. batsman c Buttler b bowler 23(15) [4s-3 6s-1]"
11349,"1 run, back of a length and just outside off, dabbed down towards third man and Suryakumar is off the mark with a single"
11350,"FOUR, nicely played, too straight from Curran, Suryakumar shuffles across, gets inside the line and picks the gap wide of mid-on with the on-drive, no need to run for those"
11351,"FOUR, beautifully played, the leg-spinner from Shreyas, drifted wide of off, Suryakumar leans forward, opens the face of the bat and lifts it inside out over cover for a boundary"
11352,"SIX, cracking shot, too short from Shreyas, batsman stays on the front-foot and then pummels the pull over mid-wicket, went a long way over the ropes for a maximum"
11353,"FOUR, short, wide and four, a bad ball from Tyagi at 133 kmph, Suryakumar had to reach out as he steered the cut over backward point, one bounce and over the ropes"
11354,"FOUR, cheeky and four, this was the shot that had him against trouble against team, but he's played it well here - short of a length at 137 kmph, some extra bounce and Suryakumar made sure he got on top of it, chops it past the keeper and into the third an ropes"
11355,"FOUR, edged and four, three boundaries and three dots in the over - the length was wide once again, Suryakumar threw the kitchen sink on the drive, gets a thick edge that flies through the vacant slip cordon"
11356,"out Caught by Rahul Tewatia!! A soft soft dismissal for batsman - he falls to leg-spin once again. The wrong 'un and batsman read it well, came down the track, got close to the pitch and was then looking to launch it back over the bowler's end. Unfortunately for him, the bat turned slightly on impact and he ended up heaving it down the throat of Tewatia at long-on - didn't have to move an inch and the Royals have their man. batsman c Rahul Tewatia b bowler 35(23) [4s-2 6s-3]"
11357,"out Caught by Samson!! Back to back wickets for Shreyas, but what was batsman trying to do? First ball and he looks to slog Shreyas out of the park - was the wrong 'un and he didn't get anywhere near the ball, sliced it high and over cover. Samson circled around it, kept his eyes on the ball and pouches it with glee. All of a sudden, Shreyas finds himself on a hat-trick. batsman c Samson b bowler 0(1)"
11358,"out Caught by de Kock!! batsman gets back into the team and gets a duck on return. Back of a length outside off, just a hint of shape for bowler, nothing great. But this is a bad shot. Plays away from the body looking to run it to third man, only succeeds in nicking it behind. batsman c de Kock b bowler 0(2)"
11359,"FOUR, what wrists from batsman as he whips this through square leg. Back of a length around off, shovels it with the bottom hand, hurries to the fence"
11360,"out Caught by de Kock!! A replica of his dismissal against Cummins in that game against team, where he looked so frenentic. Was more composed at the crease in the time he spent here, before this happened. Tries slogging bowler off a length and inside-edges it behind. De Kock flies to his left for an excellent grab. Royals in a hole. batsman c de Kock b bowler 6(7) [4s-1]"
11361,"SIX, slips out of his hand into the half-tracker mark, batsman rocks back and launches that over long-on for a gigantic 82-meter six!"
11362,"SIX, he's backed away to a flat one that's intended to cramp him, and mowed it over deep mid-wicket for six!"
11363,"SIX, for the faintest moment, all was gone for team. He backed away to the on-side, waited for the pace-off delivery to reach, and bottom-handed the swat late over long-on for six!"
11364,"FOUR, another slower one, and batsman waits again to let it reach, carting it over the on-side for four! batsman on fire!"
11365,"out Caught by Pollard! That is an incredible catch! I mean, he did make things difficult for himself to be honest. Not sure he knew where the boundary was. batsman just got under a really full one and tried to launch this over long-on, but hand to take on the tallest fielder in the opposition - Pollard ran towards the left and leapt up, got a hand, but the ball bounced out in the first attempt - and yet, he was quick enough to grab it in the second attempt! batsman c Pollard b bowler 70(44) [4s-4 6s-5]"
11366,"FOUR, full and wide, no feet to go towards it, just gets under it and lifts it away towards long-off for four"
11367,"FOUR, full and wide, batsman gets under it and slices high towards the cover region, Krunal comes in from wide long-off to dive and cut it off, but he's touching the boundary as he does that - boundary it is..."
11368,"out Caught by Hardik Pandya! Curran's gotta go! Doesn't quite have Buttler's bottom-hand, and with the pace off, he's tried to club this with a dominant bottom-hand over long-on - doesn't get much distance, and Hardik runs in from wide long-on to comfortably hold on to a catch. batsman c Hardik Pandya b bowler 15(16) [4s-1]"
11369,"FOUR, all kinds of zig-zag, that run-up, a slower, wide length ball, batsman delays the shot and then just cross-bats a slap to long-off for four"
11370,"out Bowled! Knocked him over! The form-temporary-class-permanent thing is the cliche of all cliches, but he's nailed another yorker at 142.1km/h. Tewatia has to move around and improvise to get under that and score some much-needed runs, but it's not going to happen. Not tonight. The bails light up and batsman has to go. batsman b bowler 5(6) [4s-1]"
11371,"out Caught by de Kock! Oh this is Vintage bowler. Maybe bowler isn't old enough for the word VIintage to be associated with him, so lets say ""typical"" bowler! Angling in sharply, brute-forcing even this unresponsive Kookaburra to straighten off the seam, and take the hopping batsman's outside edge to the 'keeper for a catch. QdK just about keeps that off his face. Might consider a helmet. batsman c de Kock b bowler 1(2)"
11372,"SIX, short ball at the off-stump, batsman has a free swing across the line between mid-wicket and long-on and gets it over the fielder for six! Terrific shot, and they'll need a lot more of those!"
11373,"FOUR, slams a length ball between mid-wicket and long-on for four! Just mows this away without a care in the world!"
11374,"FOUR, another one that doesn't really have width, a short one, but even though he's cramped for room, he's picked up the length quick enough to hit the middle with the pull and club it away towards long-on for four"
11375,"out Caught by Pollard! Tries getting under it, but doesn't do so well enough to a really full ball, and the result is that he can't quite get the desired height - and that would mean Pollard at long-on has to hold on to a ridiculously easy catch. batsman c Pollard b bowler 24(11) [4s-3 6s-1]"
11376,"out Caught by Rohit! That's the end of a comprehensive performance from the Mumbai Indians. batsman backs away and tries slicing that over cover, but Rohit inside the circle takes a catch above his head to end a memorable night for Mumbai. batsman c Rohit b bowler 2(5)"
11377,"FOUR, strays it wide outside off with the angle going across, batsman slaps it through point"
11378,"out Caught by Rohit!! Mumbai pacers on fire again. And not for the first time in this tournament has batsman been dismissed after being rushed on the pull. So after a great start, he's had three successive failures. The ball just comes onto him quicker than expected as he camps on the front foot. Spoons it up off the splice to mid-on. Royals losing this match in a hurry. batsman c Rohit b bowler 0(3)"
11379,"FOUR, full on middle, strong wrists from batsman as he drives past mid-on"
11380,"FOUR, back of a length delivery across off, batsman opens the face on it to guide it past Pollard at short third man. If nothing else, it's a good chance for batsman to play himself into some form. Or is it too early to write them off?"
11381,"FOUR, more conviction in this from batsman. Short and wide, puts the cut away through cover-point"
11382,"out Caught by (sub)Anukul Roy!! Different ways to get your name out there. He probably won't get a chance to showcase his left-arm spin this season, but Anukul Roy has pulled off a blinder as a substitute fielder. Sliced off a thick outside edge as batsman tries to go leg-side. It goes up and behind Roy at short cover. He runs back, eyes on the ball which is going further and further away, but he races after it and dives with both hands, parallel to the ground while taking it. Stunning. batsman c (sub)Anukul Roy b bowler 11(13) [4s-1]"
11383,"SIX, half-tracker at the stumps, swatted into the grass banks behind midwicket"
11384,"1 run, sliding in on middle and leg, works it through midwicket"
11385,"SIX, drops it so short that it was on its way down when reaching batsman. And he does so well to generate power, which isn't always the easiest thing with such deliveries. Slaps it over the extra cover boundary"
11386,"FOUR, 134.3kph, into the feet again. It's less worse, meaning Tripathi can tickle, and gets it really fine"
11387,"out Caught by du Plessis!! Just Jadeja things! Takes an absolute specky, at deep mid-wicket, diving parallel to the ground to his right and just when he was about to skid onto the boundary triangles, tosses the ball to Faf (running from long-on) to complete the catch. Was loopier and the line teased batsman to go for the big one, attempts a heave, only to be bettered by the fielding brilliance of team. The team management won't be too disappointed and we could see batsman play more of such roles for the rest of the IPL. batsman c du Plessis b bowler 17(9) [4s-1 6s-1]"
11388,"FOUR, crunched off the middle! Full pitcher in the zone outside off and batsman just leans into the drive while slotting it in the gap through extra cover, raced away!"
11389,"1 run, a direct hit from bowler would have sent batsman back to the pavilion, wasn't to be. batsman gave up mid-way after knocking this into the leg-side and Curran did well to gather the ball quickly, missed the target by some distance though"
11390,"out Caught by Dhoni!! Huge wicket in the context for team and it's Curran who's got his England skipper. Surprises batsman with a short ball and gets good fizz off the pitch to get it climbing and restrain the timing on the shot, batsman was probably aiming for the deep square region, but the shot lacked intent and MSD does the rest behind the sticks. batsman c Dhoni b bowler 7(10) [4s-1]"
11391,"FOUR, too easy! Drifting down leg on a length and all batsman had to do help it on its way, he sits on one knee and scoops it fine of the keeper to his left"
11392,"SIX, this is poor execution from Deepak bowler! He serves another leg-stump dross and it's been picked up neatly from the in-form batsman who smokes it on one knee and sees the ball sailing over the fine leg fence"
11393,out Caught by Dhoni!! Shardul Thakur has been terrific with his lengths and variations today. Bowls the cross-seam delivery and pitches it much shorter than it did against Gill. A similar dismissal though. batsman looks to go over mid-wicket with a cross-bat swipe and sends a crisp edge through to the keeper. batsman c Dhoni b bowler 2(4)
11394,"FOUR, a real smash-me outside off. Short and wide of off, batsman gets on his tippy toes and flays it with brute power over backward point"
11395,"out Caught by Watson!! First wicket for DJ Bravo in IPL 2020. Pushes this fuller and in the outside off zone, batsman looks to play a cheeky dab with an open bat face but the ball takes the bottom half and lands in the bucket hands of Watto at short third man. Bravo went up straightaway and so did Watson, the umpires just wanted to be sure as they deemed the soft signal in favor of the bowler. batsman c Watson b bowler 81(51) [4s-8 6s-3]"
11396,"FOUR, Pat batsman would have grown up playing such shots and the length was ideal. Short at 138ks and right in the slot for him, powers the pull and gets it in the gap between long-on and deep mid-wicket"
11397,"SIX, another one to feast on for batsman and he doesn't miss out. Short and angled into the batsman, batsman loads up on the back foot and smites it many-a-mile flat over the cow corner fence"
11398,"FOUR, dropped! A relatively easy chance by Jadeja's standards. DK muscles the pull and it was hit flat to the right of the fielder at deep mid-wicket, Jaddu got there quickly but the momentum was always taking him to his right and he seemed to have lost the trajectory momentarily as he tried to take it in front of his face. Sneaks through his fingers and travels to the fence"
11399,"out Caught by SN Thakur!! Gone this time. Thakur juggles once and takes it on the second attempt. Short and got big on DK outside off, he still tries to force the upper cut and hits it flat and straight to the fielder at square third man. batsman c SN Thakur b bowler 12(11) [4s-1]"
11400,"out Caught by du Plessis!! Catching practice for Faf at mid-off. Bravo is back to doing what he does best, take wickets in the death overs and unleash his dance moves. Deceives Nagarkoti with a slower ball outside off and a tame chip to mid-off meant curtains for the batsman. batsman c du Plessis b bowler 0(2)"
11401,"out Caught by Dhoni!! Goodness me! That is a spectacular catch from MSD. Sheer commitment and his athleticism was on full display while grabbing the catch. Dhoni seemed to have signalled something to Bravo just before this delivery and I'm guessing it's something to do with lack of pace. Keeps it in the shortish length area does Bravo and induces a thick outside edge on the slog. Dhoni dives full length to his right, juggles it on the first attempt and then takes the rebound with a sharp spring to his right. 150th IPL wicket for Bravo! batsman c Dhoni b bowler 0(1)"
11402,"1 run, hops, dabs in front of backward point (Jadeja again), and this time Tripathi would've comfortably been out had it been a direct hit at the non-striker's. Alas .."
11403,"FOUR, ah, stunning. bowler looks to bang it in short, but Gill's standing taller, with a lofted pull, over mid-wicket"
11404,"FOUR, hoicked agriculturally, against the line, and despite the miscue, he's gotten it over the leg-side infield. Thakur chases, slides, flicks it back, and his knee has just brushed the boundary while a finger's still on the ball"
11405,"out batsman Run Out!! 1 run completed. Jadeja and Dhoni, goodluck taking risk against this duo. batsman powers this low full toss to deep mid-wicket and there was never a two there, team still run in hope and hope is all that'll remain for them. Jaddu fires it quickly and MSD was in perfect position to deflect it onto the stumps. batsman run out (Jadeja/Dhoni) 1(1)"
11406,"FOUR, 130kph, another bouncer gets punished. bowler clearly doesn't have the pace to trouble, but this delivery's a little higher, but still, the shortness of it allows Tripathi the time to get inside the line, swivel and hook it really fine. It also helps that fine leg's inside the ring"
11407,"FOUR, 127.2kph, on the pads, but instead of just flicking it away, Tripathi makes sure he crouches and makes it more of a sweep off his legs"
11408,"FOUR, overpitched. Tripathi connects with his swing this time, getting under this and lofting this over mid-off. This is how you celebrate promotions .."
11409,"out Caught by Dhoni!! Big loud nick. Thakur has Gill for the third time in as many IPL innings -- this time with Gill throwing it away after losing patience, losing shape and losing his timing. He tries a cross-batted heave but the length's a little too full to be doing this, and ends up getting a tickle on the under-edge through to the keeper. batsman c Dhoni b bowler 11(12) [4s-1]"
11410,"FOUR, 140kph .. and Rana flashes hard. Full, wide and a thick outside edge on Rana's slap, but there's no slip, and third man's rather square"
11411,"SIX, the knuckle ball in the slot .. and Tripathi has a full-blow at this, slicing his loft, with more height than distance, but is still over deep extra cover"
11412,"wide, 115.2kph, slower shorter one, but gets too leg-sided, angling past Tripathi's attempted pull"
11413,"SIX, slogged. One-kneed, murderous bat-swing, and despite Curran's full-leap at long-on, it just goes over. Alas, not everyone has a Polllard .."
11414,"out Caught by Jadeja !! Miscued slog-sweep. It's a normal leg-break, but Rana's adventures of wanting to smoke this over the longest part of the ground - cow corner - ends up in the hands of the fielder out there. Clearly not full enough to be slogging these .. batsman c Jadeja b bowler 9(10) [4s-1]"
11415,"FOUR, 132.5kph, juicy this. Short, wide, and it's Bravo's birthday, but for some reason, he's the one giving out gifts here. Tripathi thrashes a square cut, over point, and has a fifty. Yea, that's how you seal spots and kill debates"
11416,"SIX, 99.9kph. Wide floaty, loopy off-break. batsman lays in, this is bang in his zone, and slices this typically over deep extra cover"
11417,"FOUR, overcooks it now at full pace. batsman opens his bat face and squeezes this between point and short third"
11418,"FOUR, 134.3kph, into the feet again. It's less worse, meaning Tripathi can tickle, and gets it really fine"
11419,"out Caught by du Plessis!! Just Jadeja things! Takes an absolute specky, at deep mid-wicket, diving parallel to the ground to his right and just when he was about to skid onto the boundary triangles, tosses the ball to Faf (running from long-on) to complete the catch. Was loopier and the line teased batsman to go for the big one, attempts a heave, only to be bettered by the fielding brilliance of team. The team management won't be too disappointed and we could see batsman play more of such roles for the rest of the IPL. batsman c du Plessis b bowler 17(9) [4s-1 6s-1]"
11420,"FOUR, crunched off the middle! Full pitcher in the zone outside off and batsman just leans into the drive while slotting it in the gap through extra cover, raced away!"
11421,"1 run, a direct hit from bowler would have sent batsman back to the pavilion, wasn't to be. batsman gave up mid-way after knocking this into the leg-side and Curran did well to gather the ball quickly, missed the target by some distance though"
11422,"out Caught by Dhoni!! Huge wicket in the context for team and it's Curran who's got his England skipper. Surprises batsman with a short ball and gets good fizz off the pitch to get it climbing and restrain the timing on the shot, batsman was probably aiming for the deep square region, but the shot lacked intent and MSD does the rest behind the sticks. batsman c Dhoni b bowler 7(10) [4s-1]"
11423,"FOUR, too easy! Drifting down leg on a length and all batsman had to do help it on its way, he sits on one knee and scoops it fine of the keeper to his left"
11424,"SIX, this is poor execution from Deepak bowler! He serves another leg-stump dross and it's been picked up neatly from the in-form batsman who smokes it on one knee and sees the ball sailing over the fine leg fence"
11425,out Caught by Dhoni!! Shardul Thakur has been terrific with his lengths and variations today. Bowls the cross-seam delivery and pitches it much shorter than it did against Gill. A similar dismissal though. batsman looks to go over mid-wicket with a cross-bat swipe and sends a crisp edge through to the keeper. batsman c Dhoni b bowler 2(4)
11426,"FOUR, a real smash-me outside off. Short and wide of off, batsman gets on his tippy toes and flays it with brute power over backward point"
11427,"out Caught by Watson!! First wicket for DJ Bravo in IPL 2020. Pushes this fuller and in the outside off zone, batsman looks to play a cheeky dab with an open bat face but the ball takes the bottom half and lands in the bucket hands of Watto at short third man. Bravo went up straightaway and so did Watson, the umpires just wanted to be sure as they deemed the soft signal in favor of the bowler. batsman c Watson b bowler 81(51) [4s-8 6s-3]"
11428,"FOUR, Pat batsman would have grown up playing such shots and the length was ideal. Short at 138ks and right in the slot for him, powers the pull and gets it in the gap between long-on and deep mid-wicket"
11429,"SIX, another one to feast on for batsman and he doesn't miss out. Short and angled into the batsman, batsman loads up on the back foot and smites it many-a-mile flat over the cow corner fence"
11430,"FOUR, dropped! A relatively easy chance by Jadeja's standards. DK muscles the pull and it was hit flat to the right of the fielder at deep mid-wicket, Jaddu got there quickly but the momentum was always taking him to his right and he seemed to have lost the trajectory momentarily as he tried to take it in front of his face. Sneaks through his fingers and travels to the fence"
11431,"out Caught by SN Thakur!! Gone this time. Thakur juggles once and takes it on the second attempt. Short and got big on DK outside off, he still tries to force the upper cut and hits it flat and straight to the fielder at square third man. batsman c SN Thakur b bowler 12(11) [4s-1]"
11432,"out Caught by du Plessis!! Catching practice for Faf at mid-off. Bravo is back to doing what he does best, take wickets in the death overs and unleash his dance moves. Deceives Nagarkoti with a slower ball outside off and a tame chip to mid-off meant curtains for the batsman. batsman c du Plessis b bowler 0(2)"
11433,"out Caught by Dhoni!! Goodness me! That is a spectacular catch from MSD. Sheer commitment and his athleticism was on full display while grabbing the catch. Dhoni seemed to have signalled something to Bravo just before this delivery and I'm guessing it's something to do with lack of pace. Keeps it in the shortish length area does Bravo and induces a thick outside edge on the slog. Dhoni dives full length to his right, juggles it on the first attempt and then takes the rebound with a sharp spring to his right. 150th IPL wicket for Bravo! batsman c Dhoni b bowler 0(1)"
11434,"1 run, hops, dabs in front of backward point (Jadeja again), and this time Tripathi would've comfortably been out had it been a direct hit at the non-striker's. Alas .."
11435,"FOUR, ah, stunning. bowler looks to bang it in short, but Gill's standing taller, with a lofted pull, over mid-wicket"
11436,"FOUR, hoicked agriculturally, against the line, and despite the miscue, he's gotten it over the leg-side infield. Thakur chases, slides, flicks it back, and his knee has just brushed the boundary while a finger's still on the ball"
11437,"out batsman Run Out!! 1 run completed. Jadeja and Dhoni, goodluck taking risk against this duo. batsman powers this low full toss to deep mid-wicket and there was never a two there, team still run in hope and hope is all that'll remain for them. Jaddu fires it quickly and MSD was in perfect position to deflect it onto the stumps. batsman run out (Jadeja/Dhoni) 1(1)"
11438,"FOUR, 130kph, another bouncer gets punished. bowler clearly doesn't have the pace to trouble, but this delivery's a little higher, but still, the shortness of it allows Tripathi the time to get inside the line, swivel and hook it really fine. It also helps that fine leg's inside the ring"
11439,"FOUR, 127.2kph, on the pads, but instead of just flicking it away, Tripathi makes sure he crouches and makes it more of a sweep off his legs"
11440,"FOUR, overpitched. Tripathi connects with his swing this time, getting under this and lofting this over mid-off. This is how you celebrate promotions .."
11441,"out Caught by Dhoni!! Big loud nick. Thakur has Gill for the third time in as many IPL innings -- this time with Gill throwing it away after losing patience, losing shape and losing his timing. He tries a cross-batted heave but the length's a little too full to be doing this, and ends up getting a tickle on the under-edge through to the keeper. batsman c Dhoni b bowler 11(12) [4s-1]"
11442,"FOUR, 140kph .. and Rana flashes hard. Full, wide and a thick outside edge on Rana's slap, but there's no slip, and third man's rather square"
11443,"SIX, the knuckle ball in the slot .. and Tripathi has a full-blow at this, slicing his loft, with more height than distance, but is still over deep extra cover"
11444,"wide, 115.2kph, slower shorter one, but gets too leg-sided, angling past Tripathi's attempted pull"
11445,"SIX, slogged. One-kneed, murderous bat-swing, and despite Curran's full-leap at long-on, it just goes over. Alas, not everyone has a Polllard .."
11446,"out Caught by Jadeja !! Miscued slog-sweep. It's a normal leg-break, but Rana's adventures of wanting to smoke this over the longest part of the ground - cow corner - ends up in the hands of the fielder out there. Clearly not full enough to be slogging these .. batsman c Jadeja b bowler 9(10) [4s-1]"
11447,"FOUR, 132.5kph, juicy this. Short, wide, and it's Bravo's birthday, but for some reason, he's the one giving out gifts here. Tripathi thrashes a square cut, over point, and has a fifty. Yea, that's how you seal spots and kill debates"
11448,"SIX, 99.9kph. Wide floaty, loopy off-break. batsman lays in, this is bang in his zone, and slices this typically over deep extra cover"
11449,"FOUR, overcooks it now at full pace. batsman opens his bat face and squeezes this between point and short third"
11450,"FOUR, that's a lovely shot by Mayank! That's the kind of form he is in. Pitched up outside off and the right hander plays a gentle punch to pierce the field at covers, it's a rollicking boundary and the first one of the night for Punjab"
11451,"out batsman Run Out!! 1 run completed. A mix-up between the openers and Mayank has to depart. Brilliant stop by Warner at mid-off though. He sprinted across and stopped the drive with a dive. Mayank was committed for the second, but Rahul sends him back. And by the time he can react, Warner's throw is already at the bowler's end. That's that for batsman tonight, then. batsman run out (Warner/bowler) 9(6) [4s-1]"
11452,"1 run, put down! 121.1kph, length ball, driven back at the bowler and it comes at knee-high to the left of the bowler. Natarajan was a bit late to react and ended up parrying it to mid-on"
11453,"1 run, 134.2kph, Natarajan gets away with a full toss as batsman miscues the aerial flick. Falls in vacant deep-ish square leg region"
11454,"FOUR, that's a gift! All batsman had to do was get some willow on it. A full toss on the pads at 137.1kph, batsman flicks it fine of the man at 45. Easily done"
11455,"out batsman Run Out!! Direct hit at the non-striker's end and batsman is walking! Doesn't wait for the TV umpire's call. 139.5kph, yorker length, batsman jams it to extra cover and the Punjab batters decide to go for the risky single. Garg collects the ball cleanly and hits the bullseye at the bowler's end to catch batsman short of his crease. Brilliant work from the youngster as he had only one stump to aim at. Second run-out of the innings! batsman run out (Priyam Garg) 7(12)"
11456,"out Bowled!! Cleaned up with a googly! 88.7kph, lands marginally outside off, spins in quite sharply and batsman gets into a tangle. He is neither forward nor back to play it. To make matters worse, he is late in bringing in his bat down. The wrong 'un spins past the inside edge to cannon onto the sticks. batsman b bowler 6(6)"
11457,"FOUR, falls short of the man in the deep. Off-speed short ball, batsman swivel-pulls and isn't quite control of his shot. Samad comes in from deep backward square leg and dives forward. The ball bounces in front of him and goes past him for a boundary"
11458,"FOUR, superb batting! Nothing much wrong with the ball. A wide-ish yorker at 135.1kph, batsman opens his bat-face at the last moment to squirt it fine of the man at short third man. Just a hint of width and batsman used the bowler's pace to his advantage"
11459,"out Caught by Bairstow!! An appeal for caught-behind, team decide against the review. Meanwhile, the umpires have sent it upstairs to check if it was a bump ball. The soft signal is Not Out. A yorker length ball from round the wicket, batsman stays leg-side of the ball to jam it out. Don't think it is a bump ball. OUT signalled on the giant screen. And, the drama doesn't end there. batsman starts to walk ... and then decides to challenge the call. The umpires had a chat and decided to call the third umpire, again! A review for caught-behind. There's a spike on Ultra Edge and it's clearly an outside edge as the bat hits the ground later. After all the drama, batsman is out and he's wasted a review too. batsman c Bairstow b bowler 1(3)"
11460,"out Caught by T Natarajan!! He tried to save his team-mates, and in the end perishes. Didn't take singles off the previous two balls, sees the ball on the shorter side and goes after it with a cut shot. Isn't in control of it and offers a dolly to Natarajan at backward point. With that goes team's hopes! batsman c T Natarajan b bowler 77(37) [4s-5 6s-7]"
11461,"out Lbw!! batsman wants to review, but Punjab don't have any left. A double-wicket maiden from bowler! The googly does the trick, batsman doesn't pick it and ends up playing way outside the line of it. Gets rapped on the pads adjacent to the sticks. Only height could have saved him, but he was playing off the back foot. Umpire's call on HawkEye. batsman lbw b bowler 0(1)"
11462,"FOUR, another off-speed ball, full and on the stumps at 123.3kph from wide of the crease. Bishnoi clears his front leg and hoists it over the bowler's head for a one-bounce four"
11463,"out Bowled!! Timber! Natarajan bowls the perfect yorker. Right in the blockhole at 135.2kph and the line is accurate too. batsman goes for an ambitious drive, brings his bat down late and also plays outside the line of it. The ball crashes into the middle-stump! batsman b bowler 0(2)"
11464,"out Caught by Warner!! A pitched up delivery at 133.4kph, batsman drives hard and hits it straight to Warner at wide mid-off. The skipper pouches and then fist-pumps in delight. team win by 69 runs! batsman c Warner b bowler 0(3)"
11465,"FOUR, a helicopter flick by batsman! Overpitched delivery by Natarajan, it's right in the slot and the batsman does a Dhoni there. Flicks it and clears the man at mid-wicket quite comfortably"
11466,"FOUR, aggression written all over that shot! Pitched up outside off, batsman brings his bat down in a jiffy and lofts it over the leaping man at mid-off"
11467,"out Caught by Priyam Garg!! Quality catch by Priyam Garg at cover-point. This was struck so hard, but Garg has managed to take a sharp low catch towards his left. A short of length outside off and the cut flies straight to the fielder. Khaleel absolutely loves it as he celebrates his run with his arms wide open.. batsman c Priyam Garg b bowler 11(8) [4s-2]"
11468,"FOUR, creamed through covers by batsman! Half-volley to greet the batsman as the southpaw nails his drive through perfection, right into the gap and he's off the mark in style"
11469,"SIX, lovely shot by batsman! Length delivery on leg and batsman has played a superb pick up shot to clear the fence at deep square leg"
11470,"SIX, stand and deliver! A tossed up delivery on middle and off, batsman gets it right into the slot and thumps it over long-on for a huge six"
11471,"SIX, two in two! Overpitched delivery by bowler and it has been pumped over long-on by batsman once again. The young spinner put under pressure by Nicky P"
11472,"out Caught by Williamson!! Mayank in the balcony cannot believe this, has his hands on the head. Meanwhile, batsman looks towards the heaven and starts walking back to the pavilion in disappointment. Was down on his knee to play the sweep that induced a top-edge and flew straight to Kane Williamson at deep square leg. He's not going to miss out on those. Good comeback by Abhishek as he gets a huge wicket. batsman c Williamson b bowler 11(16)"
11473,"SIX, he means business today! Showing no mercy on the young bowlers. Loopy delivery on off, touch fuller and it has been smoked over long-off for half-a-dozen"
11474,"FOUR, smashed! Abhishek was at the receiving end a couple of overs back, it's Samad now. Touch fuller outside off, batsman throws the kitchen sink and bludgeons it past the man at wide long-off, beating his dive near the fence"
11475,"SIX, woah! One of biggest of the night. Gets to the pitch of the ball and clubs it over wide long-on for six more. Carnage!"
11476,"SIX, fastest fifty of IPL 2020! A loopy delivery around off and the southpaw has tonked it over long-off for his sixth biggie of the night"
11477,"SIX, unstoppable! Slightly short ball on middle and leg, batsman hacks it over deep mid-wicket for six more. Unbelievable hitting this!"
11478,"FOUR, up and over! Haven't seen batsman be aggressive this early in this season but this shot perhaps shows a change in mindset. Slight fuller from bowler and it's lofted straight back over his head. Clean connection and gets the result"
11479,"FOUR, educated edge if you want to call it that way but batsman gets another boundary. Hung back to the shorter length with an open bat face. Got it off the outer half, just wide of slip and races away to the third man fence"
11480,"FOUR, too full from bowler, infact it ends up as a low full toss and batsman drives it elegantly through the covers. Probably looked for that in-swinging delivery but couldn't land it"
11481,"1 run, another full toss that batsman can't take full toll of, slams it straight down the ground but long-on gets across swiftly to keep the batsmen to just a single. 100-run stand is up!! These two just enjoy batting together, don't they?"
11482,"FOUR, terrific effort from Mandeep. But the ball slips out and rolls into the rope. Flatter and outside off, batsman had the width and he slapped it to wide long-off, Mandeep ran across and put in a full length dive, got one hand to it but the ball did not stlick"
11483,"SIX, wow! This is carnage of the highest level. bowler shouted ""catch it"" but there's no crowd allowed. This was a fraction short and batsman was quick to pick the length, rocked back and hammered the pull into the deep mid-wicket's second tier"
11484,"SIX, and another.. This just keeps getting bad for Kings XI. bowler lands this right in the arc, batsman with this kind of hitting form is not going to miss out, he clears his front leg and goes straight, clearing the sightscreen comfortably"
11485,"FOUR, this time the low full toss gets the treatment. batsman made a bit of room so that he could have a free swing of his arms, pumps it straight of mid-off and the ball rockets to the fence"
11486,"1 run, fifty for batsman. Second of the season. He started aggressively today but has taken a step back once Bairstow went berserk. Looks like he will bat through the innings. Just a raise of the bat to celebrate the milestone. bowler follows batsman and is tucked away through mid-wicket"
11487,"SIX, batsman is just toying with the bowling now. Bowlers are not sure where to bowl to him. bowler goes wide outside off, batsman uses the long lever to thump it straight down the ground, all the way"
11488,"SIX, back to back sixes. The length was pulled back and batsman was waiting on the backfoot, pulls it in front of square and wide of the fielder at deep mid-wicket. He is closing in on his hundred.."
11489,"out Caught by Maxwell!! A wicket for Kings XI after almost 35 overs. Remember the Pollard-Pandya carnage, then Watson-Faf chase and now this. It is the young leggie who has broken this partnership. batsman had to go as Bairstow was playing for those three runs to get to his hundred. He takes on the googly and skies the slog sweep straight up, Maxwell settles under near long-on and pouches it comfortably. batsman c Maxwell b bowler 52(40) [4s-5 6s-1]"
11490,"out Lbw!! Excellent review from Rahul. There was a run out and Samad was short, but he wanted the bigger fish. Challenged the LBW call and got it overturned. This was the slider which skids on, batsman is caught in the crease, beaten for pace as he misses the nudge to the on-side, struck on the back pad in front of leg-stump and ball-tracking had it smashing into the sticks. So, batsman falls three short of his hundred and young Bishnoi has sent back both openers in a space of four balls. batsman lbw b bowler 97(55) [4s-7 6s-6]"
11491,"out Caught&Bowled!! And another.. Kings XI are back in this. No wicket for 36-odd overs and now they have three in seven balls. The slower delivery that sticks in the wicket, Pandey is on the backfoot because of the shortish length, he closes the bat face early and the leading edge lobs back to the bowler. Arshdeep makes no mistake in his followthrough. batsman c and b bowler 1(2)"
11492,"FOUR, dropped! Pooran has put one down. Samad charges down, gets a bit too close to the flighted delivery and lofts it to long-off, Pooran runs to his left and goes with his hands over his head, never in a position to take it and what's more he allows it to roll into the rope"
11493,"out Caught by Arshdeep Singh!! Third for Bishnoi. What a turnaround by the youngster. He saw Samad shuffle across and pushed it through quicker, the pull is mistimed and Arshdeep stationed at deep square leg hangs on to a good catch. That ball was up for a long time and the pacer kept his calm to take it. team have now lost 4 wickets for 13 runs in 2.5 overs. batsman c Arshdeep Singh b bowler 8(7) [4s-1]"
11494,"out Caught by Pooran!! Pooran makes up for the drop catch and isn't he elated. Does a fist pump after completing the catch. team's innings has gone into a downward spiral. Garg decides he has to go from ball-one and heaves the slower delivery towards wide long-on, Pooran moves to his right and takes a well-judged catch. batsman c Pooran b bowler 0(1)"
11495,"SIX, wow! That's some shot. Just a chip from Sharma and the ball has cleared the rope. It was the slower delivery and Sharma was deceived for a moment there, checks his loft and manages to time it beautifully, goes all the way straight down the ground"
11496,"FOUR, banged in halfway down and Arshdeep does not have the pace to trouble the batsman, it sits up nicely for Sharma and he nails the pull in front of square, wide of long-on and though Pooran had just a few yards to cover, he was not able to stop that"
11497,"FOUR, that's a gift and batsman is too good a player to miss out. Full toss outside off, batsman does nothing fancy, just uses the pace on the ball and lofts it over extra cover. It was a safe shot with mid-off inside the ring"
11498,"SIX, woah! A one-handed six. The knuckle ball outside off, batsman was completely deceived for pace as he looked to loft it straight down, the bottom hand comes off but the ball ends up over the rope"
11499,"out Caught by Maxwell!! Another chip and this time Sharma hasn't timed it that well. It was a low full toss angled in from round the wicket, more power was needed but not sure even that would have helped, Maxwell runs in from deep mid-wicket and dives forward to take the catch. batsman c Maxwell b bowler 12(6) [4s-1 6s-1]"
11500,"FOUR, doesn't miss out this time! Short again from bowler, this sits up nicely for batsman who crunches the pull over mid-wicket. Aerial but well over the infield and it races away to the fence"
11501,"2 runs, nails the wide yorker outside off, batsman drives it in front of square and wide of the fielder sweeping in the deep, Pooran races across and releases the ball quickly, just a brace"
11502,"FOUR, poor ball, asking to be hit and batsman obliges. Not exactly a half-volley but plenty of width and it's sliced away over cover-point. Intentionally done by batsman and picks up a boundary"
11503,"FOUR, ah, shot! Top stroke! This should get batsman going. One of his favourite strokes, stands up tall and punches this wide of the man at extra cover. Wasn't that bad a ball, just a super shot and from the look of things, this pitch looks a belter"
11504,"FOUR, flies over a leaping short fine leg! 'Catch it!' was the call but the fielder had no chance at all. Another rubbish ball from bowler, short on leg stump and batsman just helps it on its way with the pull shot. Just used the pace and picked his spot to perfection"
11505,"3 runs, dropped! Great effort from KL at mid-off but these need to stick if team are to make a comeback. Dived full-length to his right and also got his right hand to it but it didn't stick. Parried it all the way towards the deep before it was hauled back in. batsman is living dangerously here, stepped down for the flat-batted hit, didn't keep it down and would be happy that it didn't go to hand"
11506,"FOUR, the carnage continues! And to be honest, bowler isn't helping his cause either by going shorter. It was pacy but batsman got hold of the pull, and belted it wide of mid-on"
11507,"FOUR, and another! This is batsman at his riveting best. Makes a hint of room, gets the shorter length that he expects and slaps it over the infield at backward point"
11508,"SIX, kaboom! batsman finally times his charge down the track well, gets to the pitch of this and lofts dead straight down the ground. Long-on can't do much as it's well wider and flatter"
11509,"FOUR, how hard has he hit this! Bishnoi looks to go wider to keep this away from batsman but he reaches this and absolutely pummels this through the covers. No chance for sweeper cover"
11510,"SIX, 18 off the over! batsman is shifting gears and has found momentum on his side. Expects the lad to go short and he is sitting deep for that already, clobbers the pull over deep square leg"
11511,"SIX, someone shouted 'catch it!' from the team team, maybe he was referring to whoever was there behind the sightscreen because this was always going to be a six. bowler overcooks and it's slower too, batsman reaches it and goes through the line with a clean loft"
11512,"2 runs, hasn't timed it well but manages to get this very straight and so, it falls in no man's land. Slower and fuller, batsman looked for the loft but couldn't get the perfection connection. Gets a brace to get to fifty! It's been a typical free-flowing innings from JB, he'll be hungry for more though"
11513,"FOUR, slower ball on the pads and batsman puts it away with ease. Coming in at 116ks and it's right on the pads for batsman to unleash those whippy wrists and play the aerial flick over mid-wicket"
11514,"FOUR, 138ks just full enough for batsman to lay into a gorgeous check-drive, plays it on the rise and pierces the gap between cover and extra cover"
11515,out Caught by Jaiswal!! Catching practice for the teenager. batsman's poor run of form continues. Was fullish and in the area where batsman naturally fllicks/whips but with bowler there's always extra pace and skid off the surface. batsman played it slightly later than he would have liked and skews it off the inside half straight to mid-wicket. batsman c Jaiswal b bowler 5(4) [4s-1]
11516,"SIX, hit-myer! bowler goes short, but this one isn't going to trouble the batsman. batsman is quick to rock back as he pulls it over deep backward square leg for six runs"
11517,"out Caught by Smith!! That's a soft dismissal, reckons KP on air. Was a wide ball outside off and batsman threw his hands at it. Miscues it towards cover-point as Smith takes an easy catch. If not with the bat, he'll do it with the ball. bowler, you beauty! Half of Delhi side back in the hut with more than 6 overs to go. batsman c Smith b bowler 39(30) [6s-4]"
11518,"SIX, too predictable. bowler sticks to his length that is on the shorter side. But the line is even worse as batsman picks it up with ease and clears fine leg for half a dozen"
11519,"FOUR, short and punished! batsman was waiting for it and slaps it towards long-on as the ball almost goes the distance"
11520,"SIX, this one has gone the distance! Goes full after bowling a short one, and the batsman reads him to perfection. Down on his knee as batsman lofts it over deep extra cover for a maxmium"
11521,"SIX, exactly! This is what that overthrow has resulted in. A full toss on off and batsman slams it over long-off as he manages to clear the man at long-off"
11522,"SIX, cruel game this! bowler bowls this one right into the slot on off and batsman goes down on his knee and smokes it over deep mid-wicket for six more"
11523,"out Caught by Rahul Tewatia!! Respite for bowler as he has managed to get rid of Shimron. He was looking for a hat-trick of sixes, but he slogs it straight to Tewatia near the boundary at wide long-on. Was a good catch as he grabbed it with a leap. Got a bit too greedy and has to pay the price for it. batsman c Rahul Tewatia b bowler 45(24) [4s-1 6s-5]"
11524,"1 run, full toss outside off, batsman slices it towards the fielder at point"
11525,"1 run, has Archer damaged his finger there? This was a rocket throw by Smith from mid-off and the bowler seems to be in some pain. But it's his left hand, so no problem. Was a full ball that was drilled by batsman and he has managed to get a quick single"
11526,"FOUR, pitched up by bowler and it has been lofted over extra cover by batsman to end the over"
11527,"FOUR, bowler proving to be expensive in his first game of the season. Goes full on off and batsman makes the most out of it, smashes it right over the bowler's head for four runs"
11528,"SIX, all smiles in the Delhi camp as the free-hit goes the distance. Touch full on off and it has been tonked right over the bowler's head by batsman"
11529,"no ball, byes, FOUR, that's an awful delivery! A beamer that beats batsman's pull and also beats Buttler. Five bonus runs for Delhi, more importantly the next ball is a free-hit!"
11530,"FOUR, smacked! Short ball by AJ and it has been slammed towards deep mid-wicket by batsman. Fifty up for bowler.."
11531,"out Caught by Buttler!! bowler ends his spell with a wicket, but the damage has already been done. Fires a wide one outside off and batsman gets it off the cue end as he throws his hands at it. Good cameo by Patel. batsman c Buttler b bowler 17(8) [4s-2 6s-1]"
11532,"out Caught by Rahul Tewatia!! Archer bags his third wicket! batsman looks to go big against the pacer and slogs it straight to the man at deep mid-wicket. Tewatia is everywhere in the field. A wicket, couple of catches. Good game for him so far. batsman c Rahul Tewatia b bowler 16(15) [4s-1]"
11533,"FOUR, angling in and short enough for batsman to dismiss it off his sight with a carcking pull over mid-wicket"
11534,"no ball, FOUR, front foot no ball and it's safe to say that the game has just started. Batting game I meant. batsman backed away as he got width on the off-side and absolutely spanked the drive with full face past the diving left hand of backward point"
11535,"2 runs, dropped! batsman takes on a pacy short ball and the top-edge carries all the way to the right of fine leg where Tyagi overruns and to make matters worse, he slips while letting the ball off his palm"
11536,"SIX, stand and deliver stuff! batsman waits for length and smokes it flat and straight back over the bowler's head with an air of arrogance"
11537,"FOUR, bowler continues to offer width and batsman doesn't miss out this time. Short and wide at 136ks, Iyer frees his arms and flays it over point with disdain"
11538,"FOUR, 141ks short ball slanting in wide of off, batsman rocks back and nails the pull over mid-wicket"
11539,"out Caught&Bowled!! batsman looked all at sea against the short ball and it's a similar delivery that brings an end to his stay. Yet again, looks to unleash the pull but bowler's got the pace and bounce, complete miscue and it's hung in the air for an eternity. For a brief period, there was confusion regarding who's gonna go for the catch, but Archer calls for it and takes it clean near the mid-wicket pocket. batsman c and b bowler 19(10) [4s-2 6s-1]"
11540,"FOUR, just second ball into his spell and bowler bowls it at 124ks whilst giving Iyer the width he was waiting for, open bat face and crunched off the middle through covers"
11541,"1 run, juicy full toss outside off at 136ks, batsman looks to go hard but ends up slicing the drive off the outer half towards deep point"
11542,"out batsman Run Out!! What a game young Yashaswi Jaiswal is having. He may not have starred with the bat yet, but he's done enough in this game already to make his presence felt in the side. Shane Warne is happy in the stands. Iyer pushed this towards extra cover and wanted a quick single, Pant was hesitant and sent him back after a momentary sprint. The team skipper though was too far down the pitch and Jaiswal hit the stumps direct with a rifle-like throw. Brilliant work from the teenager. batsman run out (Jaiswal) 22(18) [4s-4]"
11543,"SIX, short and sits up at perfect height for batsman who powers the pull flat and hard over mid-wicket"
11544,"SIX, make that two in a row! Another short one and this one drifts into batsman' pads to launch another maximum into the mid-wicket stands"
11545,"SIX, batsman is making six-hitting look incredibly easy. Loopy delivery and he unleashes those muscular arms to club it flat over the extra cover fence"
11546,"out Pant Run Out!! If there is one IPL game Pant never wants to revisit, this could be the one. He looked completely off today and his running explains everything. batsman knocked this towards mid-wicket and took a default sprint trying to sneak a single, Pant though was in a different planet. Doesn't even bat an eye at the field and just jogs blindly towards the batting end. The fielder at mid-wicket was sharp and he quickly threw it to the bowler who completed the formalities. Pant tried to get back, but he wasn't even in the frame. Pant run out ((sub)Vohra/bowler) 5(9)"
11547,"SIX, that run out doesn't have any impact on batsman. Gets a juicy toss up in the zone and he hammers bowler clean and straight down the ground"
11548,"FOUR, strays into the pad line, 147.8km/h of wasted gas, and that's tickled away with all the pace working against the bowler, for a boundary to fine leg"
11549,"FOUR, banged in short and into the gut, but batsman is quick enough to swivel into a shimmering pull to the backward square leg fence for four! Pretty picture, that..."
11550,"SIX, okay, he's catching up. bowler' no Nortje, and these 130ks are dibbly-dobblers for batsman, who's clearing out his front leg and heaving it into those conical sheds at cow corner"
11551,"out Caught by Hetmyer!! None of the lucky ground nonsense here. batsman wants to smoke it over long-on, and given his tryst with Sharjah, doesn't even look like keeping it down. Alas, it's a miscue, and there's only height on this without distance. Ends up at deep mid-wicket. batsman c Hetmyer b bowler 5(9)"
11552,"out Caught by Axar!! Well, well. This is getting rather tame. bowler loops it up and gets it fuller, batsman - poor old batsman - was only looking to push it away defensively to leg, but he's early, ending up with yet-another leading edge straight to short cover, who's there just for stuff like this. batsman c Axar b bowler 1(2)"
11553,"FOUR, nails his sweep now .. yea, there's a thin line between confidence and desperation, and batsman's still unsure where he stands, but he's taken this on full-blooded, going one-kneed and bisecting deep mid-wicket and deep square leg"
11554,"out Bowled!! Yea, yea, declare it, bowler' IPL. An off-spinner this, giving an impression that's it's a juicy leg-stump-line, but batsman's undone by the lack of pace on this, going way too early with his flick, only to miss it big time and let the ball ricochet off his pads onto the off-stump. Okay he's 19, but it needs to be said, batsman's made a mess here. batsman b bowler 34(36) [4s-1 6s-2]"
11555,"SIX, full pace feeding the slot -- and batsman's camping on the back foot for this precisely, with lovely high elbows on the bat swing to smoke it downtown"
11556,"out Caught by Rabada!! Flat, short, angling in, cramping out room. Yep, you've read this before. This is bang in bowler Patel's territory, his mastery. batsman goes on the back foot, clears his front leg, swats across the line, and miscues it away into square leg somewhere. Rabada probably loses the ball, or maybe he's just late to pick it up, but never mind, he's moved quickly to his right, dived, stuck his hands out, and gotten it to stick. batsman c Rabada b bowler 6(6) [6s-1]"
11557,"FOUR, this is the twist. THIS IS THE TWIST. Tewatia's cut loose, freeing up his hands and slicing this into the sightscreen straight down"
11558,"1 run, tummy-lined, around off, dabbed down to third man"
11559,"out Caught by Shreyas Iyer!! No, sorry, forget the twist. It's that same boring script. Archer looks to loft it through the line, but again, like the rest of his team, just doesn't get hold -- and with the bat-handle turning in his palms, long-off needn't do much. batsman c Shreyas Iyer b bowler 2(4)"
11560,"SIX, just gets hold. Takes the slog off the front foot, with more height than he'd have liked, but then 77 meters is enough over here, at deep mid-wicket"
11561,"FOUR, thick educated edge. Tewatia swishes a punch outside off, running it away really fine for third man to do anything with it"
11562,"out Caught by Hetmyer!! The perfect slap. But what can you do when the catch is the mother of perfects? Who else but Hetmyer. Where else but deep sweeper. And what else but a forward diving take to intercept Gopal's flashy cut. It's clearly into his fingers, but when you've taken the decision to the third umpire, why not play around with a zillion replays, waste time, and then give it out. Yes. batsman c Hetmyer b bowler 2(3)"
11563,"SIX, just brutally carved through the line. Goes after top-edge width outside off and just like that has managed to get it easily over deep point"
11564,"FOUR, 141.8kph, a bit of a top-edge in this swivel-pull, but palming over off Rabada's jump at the deep square leg boundary"
11565,"out Bowled!! Chops on. 123kph. Back of a length. Angling across. Tewatia swings in a cut of sorts. Is early. And under-edges onto timber. And much like these stop-start sentences, Rajasthan have stopped before they started. batsman b bowler 38(29) [4s-3 6s-2]"
11566,"out Caught by Pant!!Sticky slower bouncer. batsman attempts running this down to third man with his bat going upside-down, but ends up only getting a tickle ballooning up to the keeper. Pant's hobbling on his right leg as he walks across for the catch, but then smiles. Okay, stop worrying. batsman c Pant b bowler 1(2)"
11567,"out Caught by Dhawan! UH-OH! Terrific catch, and might I say, there might have been a bit of latent wrath in that angry swipe across the line! Absolutely spanks that, gets it off the inside half towards square leg where Dhawan is quick enough to hold onto a terrific catch! bowler gets batsman! batsman c Dhawan b bowler 13(8) [4s-2]"
11568,"SIX, non-chalance in that flick - a microsix, 62 meters, flicked away over a leaping Dhawan at deep backward square leg for six!"
11569,"FOUR, who'd've thought the world's best Test batsman would out-unorthodox a Maxi? Just paddle-pulls an express-pacer to fine leg, over short fine leg for four! Falls to his knees, avoiding the hit on the head, and gets a deflection on it over the in-field"
11570,"SIX, short ball, and batsman was ready for that - just rocks back onto the backfoot and mows that over deep mid-wicket for six! Is this the activation energy this reaction needed?"
11571,"FOUR, a rare rank half-tracker, and that's pulled away with all his might to wide long-on for four!"
11572,"1 run, pushes this one hastily off the backfoot to mid-on for a quick single as bowler himself has to chase after it to prevent the single - but he doesn't manage to"
11573,"out Caught by Hetmyer! That's a fabulous low catch! Umpire review - soft signal is out. He's played another one of his effortless flicks, uppishly this time, and Hetmyer has been quick in runnign in from the cow corner boundary to pick up a fantastic low catch! The catch, in all honestly, looks good. Very little evidence to overturn the soft signal - and OUT it is! batsman c Hetmyer b bowler 24(17) [4s-2 6s-1]"
